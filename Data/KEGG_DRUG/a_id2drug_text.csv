0,"Lepirudin is indicated for anticoagulation in adult patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) such as unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction without ST elevation. [L41539] Lepirudin is also indicated for anticoagulation in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and associated thromboembolic disease in order to prevent further thromboembolic complications.[L41539]Lepirudin is a recombinant hirudin formed by 65 amino acids that acts as a highly specific and direct thrombin inhibitor.[L41539,L41569] Natural hirudin is an endogenous anticoagulant found in _Hirudo medicinalis_ leeches.[L41539] Lepirudin is produced in yeast cells and is identical to natural hirudin except for the absence of sulfate on the tyrosine residue at position 63 and the substitution of leucine for isoleucine at position 1 (N-terminal end).[A246609]     Lepirudin is used as an anticoagulant in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), an immune reaction associated with a high risk of thromboembolic complications.[A3, L41539] HIT is caused by the expression of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies that bind to the complex formed by heparin and platelet factor 4. This activates endothelial cells and platelets and enhances the formation of thrombi.[A246609] Bayer ceased the production of lepirudin (Refludan) effective May 31, 2012.[L41574]Lepirudin is a recombinant hirudin that acts as a highly specific thrombin inhibitor. Its activity is measured by anti-thrombin units (ATUs) that correspond to the amount of lepirudin required to neutralize a unit of the World Health Organization α-thrombin (89/588) standard. The activity of lepirudin is 16,000 ATU/mg.[L41539,L41569] A single molecule of lepirudin binds to a molecule of thrombin, blocking its thrombogenic activity. This drug increases activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)  and PT (INR) values in a dose-dependent manner, and its mode of action is independent of antithrombin III.[L41539,L41569] Platelet factor 4 does not inhibit lepirudin.[L41539,L41569]    The pharmacodynamic effect of lepirudin was evaluated by measuring an increase in aPTT. No saturable effect was observed at the highest tested dose (0.5 mg/kg, IV bolus).[L41539] Thrombin time was considered an unsuitable routine test for lepirudin monitoring due to the high values detected (200 seconds) even at low doses.[L41539] The concomitant use of thrombolytic therapy and lepirudin is not recommended due to the high risk of bleeding that may be life-threatening. In patients with a risk of bleeding, a physician should weigh the risks of lepirudin administration against its benefits.  There is also an especially high risk of bleeding in patients who weigh less than 50 kg, and a lower dosage is required. Patients with renal impairment have a higher risk of hemorrhagic adverse events.[L41539]Lepirudin is a direct thrombin inhibitor used as an anticoagulant in patients for whom heparin is contraindicated.[L41539,A3] Thrombin is a serine protease that participates in the blood-clotting cascade, and it is formed by the cleavage of pro-thrombin. Active thrombin cleaves fibrinogen and generates fibrin monomers that polymerize to form fibrin clots.[A246624]    Lepirudin binds to the catalytic and substrate-binding sites of thrombin, forming a stable, irreversible and non-covalent complex.[A246609] This blocks the protease activity of thrombin and inhibits the coagulation process. Each molecule of lepirudin binds to a single molecule of thrombin,[L41539] and unlike [heparin], it is able to inhibit thrombin in both its clot-bound or free states.[A246609]"
1,"Cetuximab indicated for the treatment of locally or regionally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in combination with radiation therapy. It is indicated for recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck progressing after platinum-based therapy.[L30448]    Cetuximab is also indicated for K-Ras wild-type, EGFR-expressing;[L39045]    Cetuximab is not indicated for the treatment of Ras-mutant colorectal cancer or when the results of the Ras mutation tests are unknown.[L30448]Cetuximab is a recombinant chimeric human/mouse IgG1 monoclonal antibody that competitively binds to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and competitively inhibits the binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF).[A227973] EGFR is a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases found in both normal and tumour cells; it is responsible for regulating epithelial tissue development and homeostasis.[A228083] EGFR has been implicated in various types of cancer, as it is often overexpressed in malignant cells [A227973] and EGFR overexpression has been linked to more advanced disease and poor prognosis.[A227963] EGFR is often mutated in certain types of cancer and serves as a driver of tumorigenesis.[A228083] _In vitro_, cetuximab was shown to mediate anti-tumour effects in numerous cancer cell lines and human tumour xenografts.[A227963]    Approved by the FDA in February 2004 under the brand name ERBITUX, cetuximab is used for the treatment of head and neck cancer and metastatic, KRAS wild-type colorectal cancer, and metastatic colorectal cancer with a BRAF V600E mutation.[A227963,L39045] It has also been investigated in advanced colorectal cancer, EGFR-expressing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and unresectable squamous cell skin cancer.[L30448]Cetuximab is an anticancer agent that works by inhibiting the growth and survival of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-expressing tumour cells with high specificity and higher affinity than epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-α), which are natural ligands of EGFR.[L31418] Cetuximab works by inhibiting the growth and survival of EGFR-positive tumours.[A227963] _In vitro_, it promotes antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against certain human tumour types. On the contrary, cetuximab does not exert its anti-tumour effects on human tumour xenografts lacking EGFR expression.[L30448] In human tumour xenograft models in mice, cetuximab and irinotecan synergistically inhibited the growth of orthotopic anaplastic thyroid carcinoma xenografts _in vitro_ and _in vivo_. Cetuximab potentiated the _in vitro_ anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effect of irinotecan and achieved 93% _in vivo_ inhibition of tumour growth when combined with irinotecan, compared to 77% and 79% inhibition when cetuximab and irinotecan were used alone, respectively.[A227978]The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane glycoprotein and a type I receptor tyrosine kinase expressed on both normal and malignant cells. It has been investigated as a therapeutic target for anticancer treatment, as it is often upregulated in cancer types, including head and neck, colon, and rectal cancers.[L30448] When activated by its ligand, EGFR undergoes a conformational change and dimerization to form homodimers or heterodimers with another member of the ErbB family of receptors. Dimerization of EGFR activates the intracellular tyrosine kinase region of EGFR and promotes autophosphorylation, initiating a series of downstream signalling cascades, including cell differentiation, proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. This EGFR signalling pathway is often dysregulated in cancer cells, leading to aberrant cell growth and enhanced cell survival.[L31418]    Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the EGFR on both normal and tumour cells to competitively inhibit the binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and other ligands that are produced by normal and tumour tissue epithelial cells.[A11, L30448] Upon binding to domain III of EGFR - which is the binding site for its growth factor ligands - cetuximab prevents the receptor from adopting an extended conformation and thereby inhibits EGFR activation, as well as phosphorylation and activation of receptor-associated kinases (MAPK, PI3K/Akt, Jak/Stat).[A11, A228078] Inhibition of the EGFR signalling pathway ultimately leads to inhibition of cell cycle progression, cell survival pathways, and tumour cell motility and invasion.[A227963] Cetuximab also induces cell apoptosis and decreases matrix metalloproteinase and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production.[A228078, L30448] _In vitro_, cetuximab was shown to inhibit tumour angiogenesis.[A227973]    K-ras is a small G-protein downstream of EGFR that plays an important role in promoting the EGFR signalling cascade: in some malignant cells, K-ras can acquire activating mutations in exon 2 [L31418] and thus be continuously active regardless of EGFR regulation.[L30448] Since mutant Ras proteins can isolate the pathway from the effect of EGFR, K-Ras mutations can render EGFR inhibitors like cetuximab ineffective in exerting anti-tumour effects.[L30448, L31418] Cetuximab is thus only limited in its use for K-Ras wild-type, EGFR-expressing cancers.[L30448]"
2,"Etanercept is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis in adults and in chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in patients 4 years of age and older.[L14862,L45523] It is also used to manage signs and symptoms of polyarticular idiopathic arthritis and Juvenile Psoriatic Arthritis in those aged 2 years and older. Etanercept is also used to manage the symptoms of psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis.[L48526] Dimeric fusion protein consisting of the extracellular ligand-binding portion of the human 75 kilodalton (p75) tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) linked to the Fc portion of human IgG1.[L14862,A216522] The Fc component of etanercept contains the CH2 domain, the CH3 domain and hinge region, but not the CH1 domain of IgG1. Etanercept is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mammalian cell expression system. It consists of 934 amino acids. It is used to treat or manage a variety of inflammatory conditions including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and juvenile idiopathic poly-articular arthritis (JIA).Etanercept binds specifically to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and thereby modulates biological processes that are induced or regulated by TNF.[L14862,A216522] Such processes or molecules affected include the level of adhesion molecules expressed, as well as serum levels of cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases.There are two distinct receptors for TNF (TNFRs), a 55 kilodalton protein (p55) and a 75 kilodalton protein (p75). The biological activity of TNF is dependent upon binding to either cell surface receptor (p75 or p55).[A216522] Etanercept is a dimeric soluble form of the p75 TNF receptor that can bind to two TNF molecules, thereby effectively removing them from circulation. Notably, etancerpt is only capable of binding to the active trimeric form of TNF as its binding site is located in the cleft between subunits.[A77626]TNF is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses.[A216522] Increased levels of TNF are found in tissues and fluids of those with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and plaque psoriasis. "
3,"For treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and for the prevention of thrombosis. Bivalirudin is indicated for use in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), in patients at moderate to high risk acute coronary syndromes due to unstable angina or non-ST segment elevation in whom a PCI is planned.Bivalirudin is a synthetic 20 residue peptide (thrombin inhibitor) which reversibly inhibits thrombin. Once bound to the active site, thrombin cannot activate fibrinogen into fibrin, the crucial step in the formation of thrombus. It is administered intravenously. Because it can cause blood stagnation, it is important to monitor changes in hematocrit, activated partial thromboplastin time, international normalized ratio and blood pressure.Bivalirudin mediates an inhibitory action on thrombin by directly and specifically binding to both the catalytic site and anion-binding exosite of circulating and clot-bound thrombin. The action of bivalirudin is reversible because thrombin will slowly cleave the thrombin-bivalirudin bond which recovers the active site of thrombin. Inhibits the action of thrombin by binding both to its catalytic site and to its anion-binding exosite. Thrombin is a serine proteinase that plays a central role in the thrombotic process, acting to cleave fibrinogen into fibrin monomers and to activate Factor XIII to Factor XIIIa, allowing fibrin to develop a covalently cross-linked framework which stabilizes the thrombus; thrombin also activates Factors V and VIII, promoting further thrombin generation, and activates platelets, stimulating aggregation and granule release."
4,"Leuprolide is indicated for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer [L13781, L34415] and as palliative treatment of advanced prostate cancer.[L13790]     It is also used for the treatment of pediatric patients with central precocious puberty (CPP).leuprolide is also indicated for the initial treatment of the symptoms of endometriosis.[L13814]Leuprolide is a synthetic 9-residue peptide analogue of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Unlike the endogenous decapeptide GnRH, leuprolide contains a single D-amino acid (D-leucyl) residue, which helps to increase its circulating half-life from three to four minutes to approximately three hours.[A203222] As a GnRH mimic, leuprolide is capable of binding to the GnRH receptor (GnRHR) and inducing downstream modulation of both gonadotropin hormone and sex steroid levels. Prolonged activation of GnRHR results in significant downregulation of sex steroid levels, which is primarily responsible for the clinical efficacy of leuprolide in diverse conditions, including advanced prostate cancer, endometriosis, and central precocious puberty.[A203126, A203132]    Leuprolide was first approved in 1985 as a daily subcutaneous injection under the tradename Lupron�?by Abbvie Endocrine Inc.[L13850] Since this initial approval, various long-acting intramuscular and subcutaneous products have been developed such that patients can be dosed once every six months.[L13781, L13790] Leuprolide remains frontline therapy in all conditions for which it is indicated for use.Leuprolide is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue that functions as a GnRH receptor superagonist.[A203132, A203222] After an initial spike in GnRH-mediated steroidal production, including testosterone and estradiol, prolonged use results in a significant drop in circulating steroid levels, in line with those produced through other forms of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT).[A203126, A203129, A203132] The corresponding hormonal/steroidal changes produce specific adverse effects in different patient populations.    In women undergoing treatment for endometriosis or uterine leiomyomata, careful consideration regarding pregnancy status is advised. The initial increase in estradiol levels may worsen symptoms such as pain and bleeding. Long-term use of leuprolide is associated with loss of bone mineral density. Patients with a history of depression may experience severe recurrence of depressive symptoms.[L10310, L13814]    In men undergoing palliative treatment for advanced/metastatic prostate cancer, short-term spikes in testosterone levels may cause tumour flare and associated symptoms such as bone pain, hematuria, neuropathy, bladder and/or ureteral obstruction, and spinal cord compression. In addition, patients are at increased risk of developing hyperglycemia, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, which may manifest through myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiac death, or prolonged QT/QTc interval. In addition, Leuprolide may cause convulsions and embryo-fetal toxicity.[L13781, L13790]    In pediatric patients undergoing treatment for central precocious puberty (CPP), the initial steroidal spike may be associated with increased clinical signs of puberty within 2-4 weeks of treatment initiation. In addition, leuprolide may cause convulsions and psychiatric symptoms, including irritability, impatience, aggression, anger, and crying.[L13784, L13787]Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is a naturally occurring decapeptide that modulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. GnRH binds to corresponding receptors (GnRHRs) on the anterior pituitary gonadotropes, which in turn release luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH); these, in turn, affect the downstream synthesis and release of the sex hormones testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, estrone, and estradiol.[A203126, A203132]    Despite the variety of conditions indicated for treatment with leuprolide, the mechanism of action underlying efficacy is the same in all cases. As a GnRHR agonist, leuprolide binds to and initially activates downstream LH and FSH release; this initial spike in gonadotropin levels is responsible for some of the adverse effects associated with treatment. After 2-4 weeks of treatment, continuous stimulation of GnRHR results in feedback inhibition and significant downregulation of LH, FSH, and their corresponding downstream effects, producing a therapeutic benefit. These effects are reversible upon treatment discontinuation."
5,"Alteplase is indicated for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and for use in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) for the reduction of mortality and incidence of heart failure. Alteplase is also indicated for the lysis of acute massive pulmonary embolism, defined as acute pulmonary emboli obstructing blood flow to a lobe or multiple lung segments, and acute pulmonary emboli accompanied by unstable hemodynamics.[L43125]Alteplase is a recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) used as a thrombolytic agent.[L43125] It cleaves plasminogen to form plasmin, an enzyme involved in the degradation of fibrin clots. In the absence of fibrin, the alteplase-mediated conversion of plasminogen is limited, thanks to the high affinity between alteplase and fibrin.[A252330,L43125] Alteplase is a purified glycoprotein of 527 amino acids expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells.[A252345,L43125] It was first approved by the FDA in 1987 for the management of thromboembolic disease, including acute myocardial infarction (AMI).[A252270] The use of alteplase to manage AMI has decreased thanks to the availability of safer treatments such as angioplasty and stenting. However, its use for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) has increased over the years.[A252340] New thrombolytic agents derived from tissue plasminogen activator, such as [desmoteplase], [tenecteplase] and [reteplase], have also been developed.[A252270,A252345] Alteplase is also available as Cathflo Activase (intracatheter instillation) for the restoration of function to central venous access devices.[L34864]Alteplase binds to fibrin and plasminogen. Alteplase specificity for fibrin is achieved thanks to its high affinity for lysine residues. Also, it can bind plasminogen via loop structures called kringles, stabilized by three disulphide linkages similar to the ones in plasminogen. The specificity of alteplase for plasminogen bound to fibrin allows this drug to act in a clot- or fibrin-specific manner, leading to low concentrations of circulating plasmin and a lower risk of hemorrhagic transformation.[A252270,A252330]     In patients with acute myocardial infarction, alteplase reduces fibrinogen levels 3 to 6 hours after treatment. In patients with acute ischemic stroke, patients treated with alteplase have a significantly higher resolution of hyperdense artery sign, a marker of clot formation in the proximal middle cerebral artery, compared to those treated with placebo.[A252330] The use of alteplase increases the risk of bleeding and thromboembolic events. Rare cases of cholesterol embolism have also been reported.[L43125]Alteplase is a recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) that converts plasminogen to plasmin in a fibrin-dependent process. In the absence of fibrin, alteplase converts a limited amount of plasminogen. However, in the presence of fibrin clots, alteplase binds to fibrin and cleaves the arginine-valine bond at positions 560 and 561 of plasminogen, converting it into its active form, plasmin. Plasmin in turn degrades the fibrin matrix of the thrombus and promotes clot dissolution.[A252270] Alteplase initiates local fibrinolysis with limited systemic proteolysis.[L43125]"
6,"Goserelin is indicated for:    - Use in combination with flutamide for the management of locally confined carcinoma of the prostate  - Palliative treatment of advanced carcinoma of the prostate  - The management of endometriosis  - Use as an endometrial-thinning agent prior to endometrial ablation for dysfunctional uterine bleeding  - Use in the palliative treatment of advanced breast cancer in pre- and perimenopausal womenGoserelin is a synthetic hormone. In men, it stops the production of the hormone testosterone, which may stimulate the growth of cancer cells. In women, goserelin decreases the production of the hormone estradiol (which may stimulate the growth of cancer cells) to levels similar to a postmenopausal state. When the medication is stopped, hormone levels return to normal.The pharmacokinetics of goserelin have been determined in both male and female healthy volunteers and patients. In these studies, goserelin was administered as a single 250µg (aqueous solution) dose and as a single or multiple 3.6 mg depot dose by subcutaneous route.Goserelin is a synthetic decapeptide analogue of LHRH. Goserelin acts as a potent inhibitor of pituitary gonadotropin secretion when administered in the biodegradable formulation. The result is sustained suppression of LH and serum testosterone levels."
7,"Used in the treatment of symptomatic Paget's disease for patients unresponsive to alternate treatments or intolerant to such treatments. In addition, it is used in emergency situations when serum calcium levels must be decreased quickly until the underlying condition is identified. It can also be added to existing therapeutic regimens for hypercalcemia such as intravenous fluids and furosemide, oral phosphate or corticosteroids, or other agents. Calcitonin can be used in patients with azotemia and cases where intravenous fluids would be contraindicated due to limited cardiac reserves. Also for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis in women more than 5 years post-menopause.  Synthetic peptide, 32 residues long formulated as a nasal spray.Calcitonin inhibits bone resorption by osteoclasts (bone remodeling cells) and promotes bone formation by osteoblasts. This leads to a net increase in bone mass and a reduction in plasma calcium levels. It also promotes the renal excretion of ions such as calcium, phosphate, sodium, magnesium, and potassium by decreasing tubular reabsorption. In consequence, there is an increase in the jejunal secretion of water, sodium, potassium, and chloride.Calcitonin binds to the calcitonin receptor (found primarily in osteoclasts) which then enhances the production of vitamin D producing enzymes (25-hydroxyvitamine D-24-hydroxylase), leading to greater calcium retention and enhanced bone density. Binding of calcitonin to its receptor also activates adenylyl cyclase and the phosphatidyl-inositol-calcium pathway."
8,"Anakinra is an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist indicated for the reduction in signs and symptoms and slowing the progression of structural damage in moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA), in patients 18 years of age or older who have failed one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).[L35415]    Anakinra is also indicated for the treatment of Neonatal-Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (NOMID) and the treatment of Deficiency of Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist (DIRA).[L35415] Anakinra is also used off-label for the treatment of several inflammatory diseases.[A247000]    The FDA has issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the emergency use of anakinra for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in hospitalized adults with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing with pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen (low- or high-flow oxygen) who are at risk of progressing to severe respiratory failure and likely to have an elevated plasma soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR). Since anakinra is approved for this condition under EUA, the drug should only be used when there are no alternative treatment available.[L43927]Anakinra is a recombinant human interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) composed of 153 amino acid residues. Unlike native human IL-1Ra, anakinra has an additional methionine residue at the amino terminus. This drug binds to the IL-1 receptor, competing with and inhibiting the activity of IL-1 alpha and beta.[L35415] Anakinra is indicated for the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients 18 years of age or older who have failed one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), as well as the treatment of neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID) and deficiency of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA).[L35415] Since IL-1 has an important role in inflammation and immunological responses, anakinra is also used for the off-label treatment of inflammatory diseases.[A247000]    Anakinra is produced using the _E. Coli_ bacterial expression system. On November 14, 2001, it was approved by the FDA for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. It was later approved for the treatment of NOMID and DIRA on December 21, 2012, and December 18, 2020, respectively. A few studies have evaluated the use of anakinra for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).[A247265] On November 8, 2022, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) of anakinra for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients who are at risk of progressing to severe respiratory failure.[L43932]Anakinra is a recombinant human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) that blocks the biologic activity of interleukin-1 (IL-1) by competitively inhibiting its ability to bind to the IL-1 type I receptor (IL-1RI). IL-1 production is higher in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, where the amount of naturally occurring IL-1Ra cannot compete with the high level of IL-1 present.[L35415]     Anakinra has been associated with a higher probability of developing a severe infection, and the use of TNF blocking agents can increase this incidence.[L35415] Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients using anakinra. The prevalence of allergic reactions may be higher in patients with deficiency of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA), since they lack the naturally occurring IL-1Ra.[L35415] Anakinra can also decrease neutrophil counts in patients. Therefore, neutrophil counts should be assessed before initiating anakinra.[L35415]Interleukin-1 (IL-1) plays an important role in inflammation and immunological responses. Inflammatory stimuli trigger its production, and it binds to the IL-1 receptor to activate a wide variety of mechanisms. The activity of the IL-1 receptor is also regulated by a naturally occurring IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) that competes for the binding sites of the IL-1 receptor.[L35415] In rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, IL-1 levels are elevated, inducing cartilage degradation and the stimulation of bone resorption, and the amount of IL-1Ra in the synovium and synovial fluid of RA patients cannot compete with the high level of IL-1 present.[L35415] Anakinra is a recombinant, non-glycosylated form of IL-1Ra that competes with and inhibits IL-1 by binding to the IL-1 receptor; therefore, the administration of this drug reduces the inflammatory response in RA patients.[A246908,L35415]     Anakinra can also be used in the treatment of neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID) and deficiency of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA).[L35415] Patients with NOMID have spontaneous mutations in CIAS1/NLRP3, a gene that encodes cryopyrin, an inflammasome component. When activated, the inflammasome enhances and promotes the production of IL-1β, an isoform of IL-1.[A246898,L35415] DIRA is an autoinflammatory disease caused by mutations in the IL1RN gene. These mutations reduce the amount of IL-1Ra that is secreted, leading to the unopposed action of IL-1.[L35415] Anakinra controls NOMID and DIRA symptoms by inhibiting IL-1 activity.[L35415]"
9,"Human insulin is indicated to improve glycemic control in adults and pediatric patients with diabetes mellitus.Human Insulin, also known as Regular Insulin, is a short-acting form of insulin used for the treatment of hyperglycemia caused by Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes. Human insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology and is identical to endogenously produced insulin. Typically prescribed for the management of diabetes mellitus, insulin is a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas that promotes glucose metabolism. Insulin is released from the pancreas following a meal to promote the uptake of glucose from the blood into internal organs and tissues such as the liver, fat cells, and skeletal muscle. Absorption of glucose into cells allows for its transformation into glycogen or fat for storage. Insulin also inhibits hepatic glucose production, enhances protein synthesis, and inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis among many other functions.    Insulin is an important treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce or synthesize the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels. As a result, people with T1D rely primarily on exogenous forms of insulin to lower glucose levels in the blood. Insulin is also used in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), another form of diabetes mellitus that is a slowly progressing metabolic disorder caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors that promote chronically elevated blood sugar levels. Without treatment or improvement in non-pharmacological measures such as diet and exercise to lower blood glucose, high blood sugar eventually causes cellular resistance to endogenous insulin, and in the long term, damage to pancreatic islet cells. Insulin is typically prescribed later in the course of T2D, after trying several oral medications such as [DB00331], [DB01120], or [DB01261] have been tried, when sufficient damage has been caused to pancreatic cells that the body is no longer able to produce insulin on its own.     Marketed as the brand name product Humulin R or Novolin R, human insulin begins to exert its effects within 30 minutes of subcutaneous administration, while peak levels occur 3-4 hours after administration. Due to its quick onset of action, human insulin is considered ""bolus insulin"" as it provides high levels of insulin in a short period of time to mimic the release of endogenous insulin from the pancreas after meals. Bolus insulin is often combined with once daily, long-acting ""basal insulin"" such as [DB01307], [DB09564], and [DB00047] to provide low concentrations of background insulin that can keep blood sugar stable between meals or overnight. Use of basal and bolus insulin together is intended to mimic the pancreas' production of endogenous insulin, with a goal of avoiding any periods of hypoglycemia.    Human insulin is also available in an inhalable form, intended to be used as a bolus meal-time insulin. Exubera was the first inhaled insulin available on the market and was developed by Inhale Therapeutics (later named Nektar Therapeutics). Unfortunately, limited uptake by physicians and patients, poor sales, bulky packaging, and concerns over the possible impact on lung cancer development resulted in Exubera products being withdrawn from the US markets [A176005]. Exubera was followed by Afrezza, a monomeric inhaled insulin developed by Mannkind Corporation, which received FDA approval in 2016. While still available in the US, Afrezza has had similar concerns associated with its use, and had an FDA ""black box"" warning added to it to warn about use in patients with chronic lung disease. Afrezza does not currently have Health Canada or European Medicines Agency approval for marketing in Canada or the EU.     Human Insulin is a 51 residue peptide hormone produced by recombinant DNA technology by inserting the human insulin gene into Escherichia coli bacteria or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The structure is identical to native human insulin, with two amino acid chains covalently linked by disulfide bonds.     Human insulin is also available in an intermediate-acting form as NPH (Neutral Protamine Hagedorn) as the marketed products Novolin N and Humulin N. NPH insulin is provided as a crystalline suspension of insulin with protamine and zinc, resulting in an onset of action in 1 to 3 hours, duration of action up to 24 hours, and peak action from 6 to 8 hours. Due to the added crystals, NPH insulin is typically cloudy when compared to other forms of insulin and has a neutral pH.    Without an adequate supply of insulin to promote absorption of glucose from the bloodstream, blood sugar levels can climb to dangerously high levels and can result in symptoms such as fatigue, headache, blurred vision, and increased thirst. If left untreated, the body starts to break down fat, instead of glucose, for energy which results in a build-up of ketone acids in the blood and a syndrome called ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening medical emergency. In the long term, elevated blood sugar levels increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and diabetic neuropathy.Insulin is a natural hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas. In non-diabetic individuals, a basal level of insulin is supplemented with insulin spikes following meals. Postprandial insulin spikes are responsible for the metabolic changes that occur as the body transitions from a postabsorptive to absorptive state. Insulin promotes cellular uptake of glucose, particularly in muscle and adipose tissues, promotes energy storage via glycogenesis, opposes catabolism of energy stores, increases DNA replication and protein synthesis by stimulating amino acid uptake by liver, muscle and adipose tissue, and modifies the activity of numerous enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. Insulin also promotes growth and is required for the actions of growth hormone (e.g. protein synthesis, cell division, DNA synthesis). The primary activity of insulin is the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin promotes glucose and amino acid uptake into muscle and adipose tissues, and other tissues except brain and liver. It also has an anabolic role in stimulating glycogen, fatty acid, and protein synthesis. Insulin inhibits gluconeogenesis in the liver.  Insulin binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor is able to autophosphorylate and phosphorylate numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. These activated proteins, in turn, lead to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC) which play a critical role in metabolism and catabolism."
10,"For treatment of myocardial infarction and lysis of intracoronary emboliTenecteplase is a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) developed from modifications of natural human tPA complementary DNA (cDNA). It is a 527 amino acid with a substitution of threonine 103 with asparagine and substitution of asparagine 117 with glutamine within the kringle 1 domain, and a tetra-alanine substitution at amino acids 296-299 in the protease domain.Tenecteplase is a fibrin-specific tissue-plasminogen activator. It binds to fibrin rich clots and cleaves the Arg/Val bond in plasminogen to form plasmin. Plasmin in turn degrades the fibrin matrix of the thrombus, thereby exerting its thrombolytic action. This helps eliminate blood clots or arterial blockages that cause myocardial infarction.Tenecteplase binds to fibrin rich clots via the fibronectin finger-like domain and the Kringle 2 domain. The protease domain then cleaves the Arg/Val bond in plasminogen to form plasmin. Plasmin in turn degrades the fibrin matrix of the thrombus, thereby exerting its thrombolytic action. "
11,"- Indicated for the treatment of nocturia due to nocturnal polyuria in adults who awaken at least 2 times per night to void (intranasal).     - Indicated as antidiuretic replacement therapy in the management of central cranial diabetes insipidus and for management of the temporary polyuria and polydipsia following head trauma or surgery in the pituitary region (intranasal/parenteral).    - Indicated for patients with hemophilia A with factor VIII coagulant activity levels greater than 5% or mild to moderate classic von Willebrand's Disease (Type I) with factor VIII levels greater than 5% during surgical procedures and postoperatively to maintain hemostasis (parenteral).Desmopressin (dDAVP), a synthetic analogue of 8-arginine vasopressin (ADH), is an antidiuretic peptide drug modified by deamination of 1-cysteine and substitution of 8-L-arginine by 8-D-arginine. ADH is an endogenous pituitary hormone that has a crucial role in the control of the water content in the body. Upon release from the stimulation of increased plasma osmolarity or decreased circulating blood volume, ADH mainly acts on the cells of the distal part of the nephron and the collecting tubules in the kidney [T28]. The hormone interacts with V1, V2 or V3 receptors with differing signal cascade systems.    Desmopressin displays enhanced antidiuretic potency, fewer pressor effects due to V2-selective actions, and a prolonged half-life and duration of action compared to endogenous ADH [A31661]. It has been employed clinically since 1972 and is available in various formulations including intranasal solution, intravenous solution, oral tablet and oral lyophilisate [A31662]. Desmopressin is indicated for the treatment of polyuric conditions including primary nocturnal enuresis, nocturia, and diabetes insipidus. It was also newly approved for the treatment of mild classical hemophilia and von Willebrand's disease for minor surgeries. The active ingredient in most formulations is desmopressin acetate. Nocdurna, or desmopressin acetate, was approved by the FDA on June 21st, 2018 for the treatment of nocturia due to nocturnal polyuria in adults. It is available as a sublingual tablet.By mimicking the actions of endogenous ADH, desmopressin acts as a selective agonist of V2 receptors expressed in the renal collecting duct (CD) to increase water re-absorption and reduce urine production. Desmopressin has been shown to be more potent than ADH in increasing plasma levels of factor VIII activity in patients with hemophilia and von Willebrand's disease Type I [L1183]. Desmopressin demonstrates markedly diminished pressor activity. Desmopressin administered intranasally has an antidiuretic effect about one-tenth that of an equivalent dose administered by injection [L1182].Upon binding of desmopressin to V2 receptors in the basolateral membrane of the cells of the distal tubule and collecting ducts of the nephron, adenylyl cyclase is stimulated. The resulting intracellular cascades in the collecting duct lead to increased rate of insertion of water channels, called aquaporins, into the lumenal membrane and enhanced the permeability of the membrane to water [T28]. "
12,"For treatment of hemorrhagic complications in hemophilia A and B.Recombinant human coagulation Factor VIIa (rFVIIa), intended for promoting hemostasis by activating the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade. NovoSeven is a vitamin K-dependent glycoprotein consisting of 406 amino acid residues. Cloned and expressed in hamster kidney cells, the protein is catalytically active in a two-chain form.Used in the treatment of bleeding episodes in hemophilia A or B. NovoSeven is recombinant Factor VIIa and, when complexed with tissue factor can activate coagulation Factor X to Factor Xa, as well as coagulation Factor IX to Factor IXa. Factor Xa, in complex with other factors, then converts prothrombin to thrombin, which leads to the formation of a hemostatic plug by converting fibrinogen to fibrin and thereby inducing local clotting.NovoSeven activates the coagulation or clotting cascade by cleaving Factor IX and Factor X, which activates them and then leads to activation of thrombin and fibrin."

14,"For the treatment of patients with cervical dystonia to reduce the severity of abnormal head position and neck pain associated with cervical dystonia.Neurotoxin produced by fermentation of clostridium botulinum type B. The protein exists in noncovalent association with hemagglutinin and nonhemagglutinin proteins as a neurotoxin complex. The neurotoxin complex is recovered from the fermentation process and purified through a series of precipitation and chromatography steps.Botulinum Toxin Type B inhibits acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction via a three stage process: 1) Heavy Chain mediated neurospecific binding of the toxin, 2) internalization of the toxin by receptor-mediated endocytosis, and 3) ATP and pH dependent translocation of the Light Chain to the neuronal cytosol where it acts as a zinc-dependent endoprotease cleaving polypeptides essential for neurotransmitter release.Botulinum Toxin Type B binds to and cleaves the synaptic Vesicle Associated Membrane Protein (VAMP, also known as synaptobrevin) which is a component of the protein complex responsible for docking and fusion of the synaptic vesicle to the presynaptic membrane, a necessary step to neurotransmitter release."
15,"Insulin lispro is indicated to improve glycemic control in adult and pediatric patients with diabetes mellitus.[L47616]Insulin lispro is a rapid-acting form of insulin used for the treatment of hyperglycemia caused by Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes. Insulin is prescribed for the management of diabetes mellitus to mimic the activity of endogenously produced human insulin, a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas that promotes glucose metabolism. Insulin is released from the pancreas following a meal to promote the uptake of glucose from the blood into internal organs and tissues such as the liver, fat cells, and skeletal muscle. Absorption of glucose into cells allows for its transformation into glycogen or fat for storage. Insulin also inhibits hepatic glucose production, enhances protein synthesis, and inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis among many other functions.    Insulin is an important treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels. As a result, people with T1D rely primarily on exogenous forms of insulin, such as insulin lispro, to lower glucose levels in the blood. Insulin is also used in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), another form of diabetes mellitus that is a slowly progressing metabolic disorder caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors that promote chronically elevated blood sugar levels. Without treatment or improvement in non-pharmacological measures such as diet and exercise to lower blood glucose, high blood sugar eventually cause cellular resistance to endogenous insulin, and in the long term, damage to pancreatic islet cells.  Marketed as the brand name product Humalog, insulin lispro begins to exert its effects within 15 minutes of subcutaneous administration, while peak levels occur 30 to 90 minutes after administration. Due to its duration of action of around 5 hours, Humalog is considered ""bolus insulin"" as it provides high levels of insulin in a short period of time to mimic the release of endogenous insulin from the pancreas after meals.  Use of basal and bolus insulin together is intended to mimic the pancreas' production of endogenous insulin, with a goal of avoiding any periods of hypoglycemia.    Insulin lispro is produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing a non-pathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli and was the first commercially available insulin analog. Formerly called LYSPRO from the chemical nomenclature [LYS(B28), PRO(B29)], insulin lispro differs from human insulin in that the amino acid proline at position B28 is replaced by lysine and the lysine in position B29 is replaced by proline. These biochemical changes result in a reduced tendency for self-association resulting in dissolution to a dimer and then to a monomer that is absorbed more rapidly after subcutaneous injection compared to endogenous human insulin.     Without an adequate supply of insulin to promote absorption of glucose from the bloodstream, blood sugar levels can climb to dangerously high levels and can result in symptoms such as fatigue, headache, blurred vision, and increased thirst. If left untreated, the body starts to break down fat, instead of glucose, for energy which results in a build-up of ketone acids in the blood and a syndrome called ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening medical emergency. In the long term, elevated blood sugar levels increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and diabetic neuropathy.Insulin is a natural hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas. In non-diabetic individuals, a basal level of insulin is supplemented with insulin spikes following meals. Increased insulin secretion following meals is responsible for the metabolic changes that occur as the body transitions from a postabsorptive to absorptive state. Insulin promotes cellular uptake of glucose, particularly in muscle and adipose tissues, promotes energy storage via glycogenesis, opposes catabolism of energy stores, increases DNA replication and protein synthesis by stimulating amino acid uptake by liver, muscle and adipose tissue, and modifies the activity of numerous enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. Insulin also promotes growth and is required for the actions of growth hormone (e.g. protein synthesis, cell division, DNA synthesis). Insulin lispro is a rapid-acting insulin analogue used to mimic postprandial insulin spikes in diabetic individuals. The onset of action of insulin lispro is 10-15 minutes. Its activity peaks 60 minutes following subcutaneous injection and its duration of action is 4-5 hours. Compared to regular human insulin, insulin lispro  has a more rapid onset of action and a shorter duration of action. Insulin lispro is also shown to be equipotent to human insulin on a molar basis.      Insulin lispro has been shown to be equipotent to human insulin on a molar basis. One unit of insulin lispro has the same glucose-lowering effect as one unit of regular human insulin. Studies in normal volunteers and patients with diabetes demonstrated that insulin lispro has a more rapid onset of action and a shorter duration of activity than regular human insulin when given subcutaneously.[L47616]    The pharmacodynamics of a single 20 unit dose of insulin lispro at 200 units/mL (HUMALOG U-200) administered subcutaneously were compared to the pharmacodynamics of a single 20 unit dose of insulin lispro at 100 units/mL (HUMALOG U-100) administered subcutaneously in a euglycemic clamp study enrolling healthy subjects. In this study, the overall, maximum, and time to maximum glucose lowering effect were similar between HUMALOG U-200 and HUMALOG U-100. The mean area under the glucose infusion rate curves (measure of overall pharmacodynamic effect) were 125 g and 126 g for HUMALOG U-200 and HUMALOG U-100, respectively. The maximum glucose infusion rate was 534 mg/min and 559 mg/min and the corresponding median time (min, max) to maximum effect were 2.8 h (0.5 h �?6.3 h) and 2.4 h (0.5 h �?4.7 h) for HUMALOG U-200 and HUMALOG U-100, respectively.[L47616] Insulin lispro binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor autophosphorylates and phosphorylates numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. Activation of these proteins leads to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC), both of which play critical roles in metabolism and catabolism. In humans, insulin is stored in the form of hexamers; however, only insulin monomers are able to interact with IR. Reversal of the proline and lysine residues at positions B28 and B29 of native insulin eliminates hydrophobic interactions and weakens some of the hydrogen bonds that contribute to the stability of the insulin dimers that comprise insulin hexamers. Hexamers of insulin lispro are produced in the presence of zinc and cresol. These weakly associated hexamers quickly dissociate upon subcutaneous injection and are absorbed as monomers through vascular endothelial cells. These properties give insulin lispro its fast-acting properties. "
16,"Insulin glargine is indicated to improve glycemic control in adults and pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.[L12474,L43532,L43587]Insulin glargine is a long-acting form of insulin used for the treatment of hyperglycemia caused by Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes. Insulin is typically prescribed for the management of diabetes mellitus to mimic the activity of endogenously produced human insulin, a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas that promotes glucose metabolism. Insulin is released from the pancreas following a meal to promote the uptake of glucose from the blood into internal organs and tissues such as the liver, fat cells, and skeletal muscle. Absorption of glucose into cells allows for its transformation into glycogen or fat for storage. Insulin also inhibits hepatic glucose production, enhances protein synthesis, and inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis.    Insulin is an important treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce or synthesize the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels. As a result, people with T1D rely primarily on exogenous forms of insulin, such as insulin glargine, to lower glucose levels in the blood. Insulin is also used in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), another form of diabetes mellitus that is a slowly progressing metabolic disorder caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors that promote chronically elevated blood sugar levels. Without treatment or improvement in non-pharmacological measures such as diet and exercise to lower blood glucose, high blood sugar eventually causes cellular resistance to endogenous insulin, and in the long term, damage to pancreatic islet cells. Insulin is typically prescribed later in the course of T2D, after several oral medications such as [DB00331], [DB01120], or [DB01261] have been tried, when sufficient damage has been caused to pancreatic cells that the body is no longer able to produce insulin on its own.     Available as the brand name product Lantus, insulin glargine has a duration of action up to 24 hours allowing for once-daily dosing, typically at bedtime. Due to its duration of action, Lantus is considered ""basal insulin"" as it provides low concentrations of background insulin that can keep blood sugar stable between meals or overnight. Basal insulin is often combined with short-acting ""bolus insulin"" such as [DB00046], [DB01309], and [DB01306] to provide higher doses of insulin that are required following meals. Use of basal and bolus insulin together is intended to mimic the pancreas' production of endogenous insulin, with a goal of avoiding any periods of hypoglycemia.     Insulin glargine is also available as the biosimilar, or ""follow-on"" product, Basaglar in the US and as Abasaglar in the EU. As of 2015, insulin glargine was reformulated by Sanofi as the product Toujeo in an extra-concentrated form containing 300IU/mL (compared to 100IU/mL contained in Lantus). Use of the higher concentrated Toujeo as compared to Lantus results in slightly different pharmacokinetics, with a later onset (up to 6 hours) and duration of action (up to 30 hours). In 2021, another biosimilar, Semglee (insulin glargine-yfgn),[L34959] became the first interchangeable (with Lantus) biosimilar insulin to receive FDA approval.[L34964]    Insulin glargine is produced by recombinant DNA technology using a non-pathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli (K12) as the production organism. Insulin glargine differs from endogenous human insulin by the replacement of an asparagine residue at position A21 of the A-chain with glycine and addition of two arginines to the C-terminus (positions B31 and 32) of the B-chain. The resulting protein is soluble at pH 4 and forms microprecipitates at physiological pH 7.4 allowing for the slow release of small amounts of insulin glargine, giving the drug a long duration of action and no pronounced peak concentration.    Without an adequate supply of insulin to promote absorption of glucose from the bloodstream, blood sugar levels can climb to dangerously high levels and can result in symptoms such as fatigue, headache, blurred vision, and increased thirst. If left untreated, the body starts to break down fat, instead of glucose, for energy which results in a build-up of ketone acids in the blood and a syndrome called ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening medical emergency. In the long term, elevated blood sugar levels increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and diabetic neuropathy.Insulin is a natural hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas. In non-diabetic individuals, the pancreas produces a continuous supply of low levels of basal insulin along with spikes of insulin following meals. Increased insulin secretion following meals is responsible for the metabolic changes that occur as the body transitions from a postabsorptive to absorptive state. Insulin promotes cellular uptake of glucose, particularly in muscle and adipose tissues, promotes energy storage via glycogenesis, opposes catabolism of energy stores, increases DNA replication and protein synthesis by stimulating amino acid uptake by liver, muscle and adipose tissue, and modifies the activity of numerous enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. Insulin also promotes growth and is required for the actions of growth hormone (e.g. protein synthesis, cell division, DNA synthesis). Insulin glargine is a long-acting insulin analogue with a flat and predictable action profile. It is used to mimic the basal levels of insulin in diabetic individuals. Insulin glargine binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor autophosphorylates and phosphorylates numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. Activation of these proteins leads to the activation of downstream signalling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC), both of which play critical roles in metabolism. Insulin glargine is completely soluble at pH 4, the pH of administered solution, and has low solubility at physiological pH 7.4. Upon subcuteous injection, the solution is neutralized resulting in the formation of microprecipitates. Small amounts of insulin glargine are released from microprecipitates giving the drug a relatively constant concentration over time profile over 24 hours with no pronounced peak. This release mechanism allows the drug to mimic basal insulin levels within the body. "
17,"For treatment of hyperuricemia, reduces elevated plasma uric acid levels (from chemotherapy)Rasburicase is a recombinant urate-oxidase enzyme produced by a genetically modified <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> strain. The cDNA coding for rasburicase was cloned from a strain of _Aspergillus flavus_.Drugs used to treat lympohoid leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and acute myelogenous leukemia often lead to the accumulation of toxic plasma levels of purine metabolites (i.e. uric acid). The injection of rasburicase reduces levels of uric acid and mitigates the toxic effects of chemotherapy induced tumor lysis.Rasburicase catalyzes enzymatic oxidation of uric acid into an inactive and soluble metabolite (allantoin)."
18,"Abciximab is indicated as an adjunct to percutaneous coronary intervention for the prevention of cardiac ischemic complications in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention and in patients with unstable angina not responding to conventional medical therapy when percutaneous coronary intervention is planned within 24 hours. Abciximab is intended for use with aspirin and heparin and has been studied only in that setting.Abciximab is a Fab fragment of the chimeric human-murine monoclonal antibody 7E3. Abciximab binds to the glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor of human platelets and inhibits platelet aggregation by preventing the binding of fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and other adhesive molecules. It also binds to vitronectin (αvβ3) receptor found on platelets and vessel wall endothelial and smooth muscle cells.Abciximab inhibits platelet aggregation by preventing the binding of fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and other adhesive molecules to GPIIb/IIIa receptor sites on activated platelets. A single intravenous bolus dose from 0.15 mg/kg to 0.30 mg/kg produced rapid dose-dependent inhibition of platelet function. After two hours post-injection with a dose of 0.25 - 0.30 mg/kg, 80% of the GPIIb/IIIa receptors were blocked and platelet aggregation was prevented. GPIIb/IIIa is the major surface receptor involved in the final pathway of platelet aggregation. Bleeding time increases to over 30 minutes at the aforementioned doses. To compare, baseline values were five minutes. Abciximab binds to the intact platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptor, which is a member of the integrin family of adhesion receptors and the major platelet surface receptor involved in platelet aggregation. This binding is thought to involve steric hindrance and/or conformational alterations which block access of large molecules to the receptor rather than direct interaction with the RGD (arginine-glycine-aspartic acid) binding site of GPIIb/IIIa. By binding to the vitronectin receptor (also known as the αvβ3 integrin), abciximab blocks effects mediated by this integrin which include cell adhesion. Furthermore, abciximab blocks Mac-1 receptor on monocytes and neutrophils thus inhibiting monocyte adhesion."
19,"Vasopressin is indicated to increase blood pressure in adults in vasodilatory shock refractory to the application of fluids and catecholamines.[L31413]Vasopressin (arginine-vasopressin or antidiuretic hormone) is a nonapeptide primarily produced in the hypothalamus that exhibits diverse physiological functions related to diuresis, hemodynamic modulation, and behaviour.[A110, A111, A112, A113, A228008] Vasopressin is very similar to oxytocin, differing in the third and eighth amino acids.[A228013] Despite a wide variety of functions, exogenous vasopressin is primarily used to control blood pressure during systemic shock by increasing vasoconstriction and renal fluid reuptake by acting through V1 and V2cellular receptors.[A228008, A228013, A228018, L31413]    The vasopressive effect of posterior pituitary gland extracts was noted in 1895, while vasopressin itself was not purified until 1951. It has been used for more than five decades for varying conditions, including variceal bleeding, diabetes insipidus, and, more recently, vasodilatory shock.[A228013] It is currently marketed under the trademark VASOSTRICT® by PAR Pharmaceuticals.[L31413]Vasopressin is a nonapeptide antidiuretic hormone involved in modulating various physiological processes, including autonomic signalling, stress response, behaviour, and memory; the most well-known modulation is of blood pressure.[A110, A111, A112, A113, L31413] Vasopressin acts both within the brain and in the periphery to modulate blood pressure through sympathetic outflow, baroreflex modulation, vasoconstriction, and renal fluid retention.[A228008, A228013, A228018] These mechanisms vary by location and physiological state, leading to occasionally contradictory responses to vasopressin. Although generally safe, vasopressin may worsen cardiac output in patients with impaired cardiac function. The cessation of vasopressin therapy may result in transient reversible diabetes insipidus, which may require additional desmopressin or vasopressin to manage.[L31413]Vasopressin, Cyclo (1-6) L-Cysteinyl-L-Tyrosyl-L-PhenylalanylL-Glutaminyl-L-Asparaginyl-L-Cysteinyl-L-Prolyl-L-Arginyl-L-Glycinamide, is a cyclic nonapeptide hormone primarily produced by the supraoptic and periventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus.[A228008, L31413] Vasopressin release is mediated by sensory pathways, in which either a 2% increase in plasma osmolarity or a 10% decrease in blood pressure causes the release of endogenous vasopressin.[A228013] Upon release, vasopressin mediates a variety of physiological effects, both centrally and systemically, primarily by binding to G-protein-coupled receptors termed V1< (V1A), V2, and V3 (V1B).    V1 receptors are abundantly expressed in the brain whereby vasopressin binding can increase blood pressure through autonomic pathways.[A228008] Peripherally, V1is localized in the blood vessels (vascular smooth muscle), platelets, adrenal glands, kidneys, and liver.[A228008, A228018] Vasopressin binding to V1causes hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate into inositol triphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) and diacylglycerol (DAG) by phospholipase C, which in turn release intracellular calcium and activate protein kinase C (PKC) to open voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) while closing potassium channels. Overall, intracellular calcium levels rise, which bind calmodulin and cause muscular contraction, resulting in vasoconstriction.[A228013] This is balanced by the apparent ability of vasopressin to induce vasodilation through binding oxytocin receptors and activating endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase; NO acts antagonistically to reduce muscle contraction.[A228013] It is also thought that vasopressin, acting through both V1 and oxytocin receptors, causes the cardiac release of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), which has a negative inotropic effect; indeed, vasopressin tends to decrease heart rate and cardiac output, although the opposite effect has been noted with low doses.[A228013, L31413]    V2 receptors are abundantly expressed in the distal convoluted tubules and the collecting ducts of the kidneys.[A228018, A228023] Vasopressin binding to V2causes activation of a G<sub>s</sub> protein that subsequently activates protein kinase A (PKA) through adenylyl cyclase-mediated increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which leads to phosphorylation of the water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2) and its trafficking to the cell surface.[A228018, A228023] Increased AQP2 levels lead to increased water reabsorption and explains vasopressin's antidiuretic effects.[A228018]    V3 (formerly V1B) receptors are primarily located in the anterior pituitary and brain.[A228008, A228018] Vasopressin released during acute stress causes adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) release from the pituitary through V3 and by potentiating the effects of corticotrophin-releasing factor. Within the brain itself, V3 activation modulates various effects, including recognition, memory, aggression, anxiety, and depression.[A228008]    Thus, vasopressin can affect a wide variety of physiological processes, often in apparently contradictory ways depending on the patient's dose and physiological state. Vasodilatory shock causes an immediate release of vasopressin from 20 to 200 times its normal serum concentration, which falls again to normal levels in prolonged shock; in this context, normal serum levels are insufficient to control the pathologic vasodilation.[A228013, A228018] In these cases, vasopressin acts to depolarize hyperpolarized vascular smooth muscle cells, restore sensitivity to catecholamines, and inhibit excessive nitric oxide production, primarily through acting through V1 receptors. Therefore, vasopressin helps decrease the dose requirement for norepinephrine and is routinely administered together with norepinephrine to restore normal blood pressure in shock states.[A228018, L31413]"
20,"Interferon beta-1b is a drug used for the treatment of relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis. It has been shown to slow the advance of the disease as well as to decrease the frequency of attacks.Human interferon beta (165 residues), cysteine 17 is substituted with serine. Produced in E. coli, no carbohydrates, MW=18.5kDInterferon beta upregulates the expression of MHC I proteins, allowing for increased presentation of peptides derived from viral antigens. This enhances the activation of CD8+ T cells that are the precursors for cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and makes the macrophage a better target for CTL-mediated killing. Type I interferons also induce the synthesis of several key antiviral mediators including 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase (2'-5' A synthetase), beta-2 microglobulin, neopterin and protein kinase R.Interferon beta binds to type I interferon receptors (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2c) which activate two Jak (Janus kinase) tyrosine kinases (Jak1 and Tyk2). These transphosphorylate themselves and phosphorylate the receptors. The phosphorylated INFAR receptors then bind to Stat1 and Stat2 (signal transducers and activators of transcription)which dimerize and activate multiple (~100) immunomodulatory and antiviral proteins. Interferon beta binds more stably to type I interferon receptors than interferon alpha."
21,"For the adjuvant treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer, trastuzumab is indicated in several clinical settings: as part of a treatment regimen consisting of doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and either paclitaxel or docetaxel; as part of a treatment regimen with docetaxel and carboplatin; or as monotherapy following multi-modality anthracycline-based therapy.[L14015]    Trastuzumab is indicated as a first-line treatment, in combination with paclitaxel, for metastatic HER2-overexpressing breast cancer, and as monotherapy in patients who have previously received one or more chemotherapy regimens in the metastatic setting.[L14015] In Europe, trastuzumab can also be used in combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel for the treatment of metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer in adult patients and with an aromatase inhibitor in postmenopausal patients.[L49324]    For HER2-positive early breast cancer, the EMA approved trastuzumab as monotherapy following surgery, chemotherapy (neoadjuvant or adjuvant), and radiation or following adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide in combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel. It can also be used in combination with adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel and carboplatin or with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by adjuvant trastuzumab therapy for locally advanced (including inflammatory) disease or tumors > 2 cm in diameter.[L49324]    Trastuzumab is also indicated, in combination with cisplatin and capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil, for the treatment of patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who have not received prior treatment for metastatic disease by the FDA and EMA.[L14015]    Trastuzumab is indicated for subcutaneous administration - in combination with either [hyaluronidase][L14132] or both hyaluronidase and [pertuzumab][L14510] - for the treatment of adults with HER2-positive breast cancers.Produced in CHO cell cultures, trastuzumab is a recombinant IgG1 kappa, humanized monoclonal antibody [A40276] that selectively binds with high affinity in a cell-based assay (Kd = 5 nM) to the extracellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor protein (HER2).[L14015] It is used as a treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-2+ metastatic breast cancer, where there is a proven amplification of the HER-2 oncogene or over-expression of the HER-2 protein in tumours. It is suggested that the overexpression or gene amplification of HER2 has been found in about 20�?0% of breast cancers and elevated activation of HER2 triggers multiple downstream pathways leading to abnormal proliferation of cancer cells [A121]. Trastuzumab binds to HER2 and suppresses cancer cell growth, proliferation, and survival directly and indirectly [A121].    In December 2017, FDA approved OGIVRI (trastuzumab-dkst) as a biosimilar to Herceptin (trastuzumab) for the treatment of patients with breast or metastatic stomach cancer (gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma) whose tumors overexpress the HER2 gene (HER2+). It displays biosimilar properties as Herceptin according to clinical data. While Ogivri is the first biosimilar approved in the U.S. for the treatment of breast cancer or stomach cancer, it is the second biosimilar approved in the U.S. for the treatment of cancer. Herzuma (trastuzumab-pkrb) is a biosimilar drug approved in December 2018 for the treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. KANJINTI (trastuzumab-anns) is another biosimilar approved by the FDA in June 2019.[L14135] ONTRUZANT, another biosimilar of Herceptin, was approved by Health Canada in February 2022.[L40303, L40308] In November 2023, trastuzumab was also approved by the EMA under the brand name Herwenda.[L49339]Trastuzumab exerts an antitumour activity and is used in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. HER2 protein overexpression is observed in 20%-30% of primary breast cancers [A40277] thus HER2 presents as a useful therapeutic target for the treatment of breast cancers. Trastuzumab has been shown, in both _in vitro_ assays and in animals, to inhibit the proliferation of human tumour cells that overexpress HER2. It works as a mediator of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, where it binds as an antibody to cells over-expressing HER2, leading to preferential cell death. Trastuzumab was also shown to inhibit angiogenesis of tumor cells _in vivo_ [A121]. Higher doses and longer dosing intervals show no significant benefit over standard dose schedules [A40276]. In patients with HER2 positive solid tumours, trastuzumab did not exert any clinically significant QTc interval duration.[L14015]Trastuzumab is a recombinant humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody against the HER-2 receptor, a member of the epidermal growth factor receptors which is a photo-oncogene. Over-expressed in breast tumour cells, HER-2 overamplifies the signal provided by other receptors of the HER family by forming heterodimers [A121]. The HER-2 receptor is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor that consists of an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane region, and an intracellular or cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. It is activated by the formation of homodimers or heterodimers with other EGFR proteins, leading to dimerization and autophosphorylation and/or transphosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in EGFR intracellular domains [A121]. Further downstream molecular signaling cascades are activated, such as the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt, and the phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ)/protein kinase C (PKC) pathways that promote cell growth and survival and cell cycle progression [A121]. Due to upregulation of HER-2 in tumour cells, hyperactivation of these signaling pathways and abnormal cell proliferation is observed. Trastuzumab binds to the extracellular ligand-binding domain and blocks the cleavage of the extracellular domain of HER-2 to induce its antibody-induced receptor downmodulation [A121], and subsequently inhibits HER-2-mediated intracellular signaling cascades. Inhibition of MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways lead to an increase in cell cycle arrest, and the suppression of cell growth and proliferation [A121]. Trastuzumab also mediates the activation of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) [A40276] by attracting the immune cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells, to tumor sites that overexpress HER-2 [A121]. While the drug alone has a minimal potential to induce complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC),[A201902] one study demonstrated increased therapeutic effectiveness and a synergistic effect on uterine serous carcinoma cells _in vitro_ when used in combination with [pertuzumab], which also has minor effects on CDC alone. This study showed that only the combination of both cell-bound antibodies would be sufficient to bind and activate the complement component 1q (C1q) required to initiate the complement cascade reaction.[A201896]    Intrinsic trastuzumab resistance has been noted for some patients with HER-2 positive breast cancer. Mechanisms involving trastuzumab resistance include deficiency of phosphatase and tensin homologue and activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and the overexpression of other surface receptors, such as insulin-like growth factor [A40276]."
22,"For treatment of organ transplant recipients, prevention of organ rejectionMurine monoclonal antibody specific to CD3 T-cell lymphocyte antigens. More specifically it is a purified murine (mouse) monoclonal antibody, directed against the CD3 (T3) receptor on the surface of human T-cells (T-lymphocytes) cultured using the murine ascites method. Muromonab is 93% monomeric immune globulin G type 2a (IgG2a).Used in organ transplant prophylaxis, Muromonab or OKT-3 binds specifically to the CD-3 complex, which is involved in antigen recognition and cell stimulation, on the surface of T lymphocytes. Immediately after administration CD-3-positive T lymphocytes are abruptly removed from circulation. It has been effective in reversing corticosteroid-resistant acute rejection in renal, liver, and cardiac transplant recipients.Muromonab binds to the T-cell surface glycoprotein CD3 epsilon chain. It appears to kill CD-3 positive cells by inducing Fc mediated apoptosis, antibody mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity."
23,"Daptomycin is indicated for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) in patients one year of age and older. It is also indicated for the treatment of _Staphylococcus aureus_ bloodstream infections (bacteremia) in patients one year of age and older, including in adult patients with right-sided infective endocarditis.[L32534]    Daptomycin is not indicated for the treatment of pneumonia or left-sided infective endocarditis due to _S. aureus_. Use is not recommended in pediatric patients younger than one year of age due to the risk of potential effects on muscular, neuromuscular, and/or nervous systems (either peripheral and/or  central).[L32534]    As with all antibacterial drugs, it is strongly suggested to perform sufficient testing before treatment initiation in order to confirm an infection caused by susceptible bacteria. Failure to do so may result in suboptimal treatment, treatment failure, and the development of drug-resistant bacteria.[L32534]Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide antibacterial agent with a broad spectrum of activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MSSA/MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE).[A231379, A231384, L32534] Chemically, daptomycin comprises 13 amino acids, including several non-standard and D-amino acids, with the C-terminal 10 amino acids forming an ester-linked ring and the N-terminal tryptophan covalently bonded to decanoic acid.[A231374, L32534] Daptomycin was first discovered in the early 1980s by researchers at Eli Lilly in soil samples from Mount Ararat in Turkey.[A231384] Early work on developing daptomycin was abandoned due to observed myopathy but was resumed in 1997 when Cubist Pharmaceuticals Inc. licensed daptomycin; it was found that a once-daily dosing scheme reduced side effects while retaining efficacy.[A231379]    Daptomycin was approved by the FDA on September 12, 2003, and is marketed under the name CUBICIN® by Cubist Pharmaceuticals LLC (Merck & Co.).[L32534]Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide antibacterial agent produced as a fermentation product by the soil microbe _Streptomyces roseosporus_. The daptomycin core consists of 13 amino acids, including three D-amino acids, ornithine, 3-methyl-glutamic acid, and kynurenine, with the C-terminal 10 amino acids forming an ester-linked ring and the N-terminal tryptophan covalently bonded to decanoic acid.[A231374, L32534] Daptomycin is active against aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, including clinically relevant strains such as methicillin-susceptible and -resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MSSA/MRSA), vancomycin-resistant _S. aureus_, vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE),  _Staphylococcus_ spp., _Streptococcus_ spp., _Clostridiodes difficile_, _Clostridium perfringens_, _Finegoldia magna_, and _Propionibacterium acnes_, among others.[A231379, A231384, L32534] Although daptomycin is active against _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ _in vitro_, it is inhibited by lung surfactant, and hence is not effective for the treatment of pneumonia or other similar lung infections.[A231379, A231389, L32534] Daptomycin exhibits rapid concentration-dependent bactericidal activity _in vitro_, which correlates best with the ratio of the area under the concentration-time curve to the minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC) in animal models of infection.[L32534]     Like other antibacterial agents, daptomycin carries a risk of severe hypersensitivity reactions, including Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS). There have been reports of myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, and increased creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels in patients taking daptomycin, which increased when daptomycin was given more than once per day. Patients should be monitored for CPK levels and, in those with renal impairment, renal function, at least once per week and should consider temporarily suspending the use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Daptomycin should not be administered more than once per day. Severe adverse reactions such as tubulointerstitial nephritis and peripheral neuropathy have been reported, which may require treatment discontinuation. Based on animal studies, patients less than one year of age may experience serious muscular, neuromuscular, and nervous system effects; daptomycin is not recommended for use in patients under one year of age. Patients undergoing daptomycin treatment may experience eosinophilic pneumonia and _Clostridioides difficile_-associated diarrhea, both of which may require the cessation of antibacterial treatment and initiation of symptomatic/supportive measures. Persisting or relapsing _S. aureus_ bacteremia and endocarditis should be investigated for sequestered foci of infection and the possibility of daptomycin resistance; the dose or treatment regimen may require adjusting. Patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatine clearance < 50 mL/min) experienced reduced clinical benefit from daptomycin treatment based on limited data. Clinically relevant daptomycin plasma concentrations have significantly affected prothrombin time and International Normalized Ratio (INR) measurements. As with all antibiotics, daptomycin use may promote the overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms and the development of resistant organisms; daptomycin use should be limited to cases where it is proven or strongly suspected that an infection is caused by susceptible bacteria.[L32534]The mechanism of action of daptomycin remains poorly understood. Studies have suggested a direct inhibition of cell membrane/cell wall constituent biosynthesis, including peptidoglycan, uridine diphosphate-N-acid, acetyl-L-alanine, and lipoteichoic acid (LTA). However, no convincing evidence has been presented for any of these models, and an effect on LTA biosynthesis has been ruled out by other studies in _S. aureus_ and _E. faecalis_.[A231384, A231394, A14171]    It is well understood that free daptomycin (apo-daptomycin) is a trianion at physiological pH, which binds Ca<sup>2+</sup> in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio to become a monoanion, which is thought to rely primarily on the Asp(7), Asp(9), and L-3MeGlu12 residues that form a DXDG motif.[A231374, A231379, A231384] Calcium-binding facilitates daptomycin's insertion into bacterial membranes preferentially due to their high content of the acidic phospholipids phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and cardiolipin (CL), wherein it is proposed that daptomycin can bind two calcium equivalents and form oligomers.[A231379] PG is recognized as the main membrane requirement for daptomycin activity; daptomycin preferentially localizes in PG-rich membrane domains, and mutations affecting PG prevalence are linked to daptomycin resistance.[A231379] Calcium-dependent membrane binding is the generally accepted mechanism of action for daptomycin, but the precise downstream effects are unclear, and numerous models have been proposed.    One mechanism proposes that the daptomycin membrane binding alters membrane fluidity, causing dissociation of cell wall biosynthetic enzymes such as the lipid II synthase MurG and the phospholipid synthase PlsX.[A231384] This is consistent with the observed effects of daptomycin on cell shape in various bacteria at concentrations at or above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).[A14171] Aberrant cell morphology is also consistent with the observed localization of daptomycin at the division septa and a hypothesized role in inhibiting cell division.[A231379] A recent study suggested the formation of tripartite complexes containing calcium-bound daptomycin, PG, and various undecaprenyl-coupled cell envelope precursors, which subsequently include lipid II. This complex is proposed to inhibit cell division, lead to the dispersion of cell wall biosynthetic machinery, and eventually cause lysis of the membrane bilayer at the septum causing cell death.[A231384, A231409]    Another popular model is based on early observations that daptomycin, in a calcium-dependent manner, caused potassium ion leakage and loss of membrane potential in treated bacterial cells.[A231394, A231419, A231424] Although this lead some to suggest that daptomycin could bind PG to form oligomeric pores in the bacterial membrane,[A231384] no cell lysis was observed in _S. aureus_ or _E. faecalis_,[A231379] and the daptomycin-induced ion conduction is inconsistent with pore formation.[A231429] Rather, it has been proposed that daptomycin forms calcium-dependent dimeric complexes in fixed ratios of Dap<sub>2</sub>Ca<sub>3</sub>PG<sub>2</sub>, which can act as transient ionophores.[A231429] The observed loss of membrane potential is suggested to result in a non-specific loss of gradient-dependent nutrient transport, ATP production, and biosynthesis, leading to cell death.[A231379, A231424]    Notably, these models are not strictly mutually exclusive and are supported to varying extents by observed resistance mutations. The strict requirement for PG for daptomycin bactericidal action is supported by mutations in _mprF_, _cls2_, _pgsA_, and the _dlt_ operon in _S. aureus_, _cls_ in various enterococci, and _pgsA_, PG synthase, and the _dlt_ operon in _E. faecium_, all of which alter the bacterial membrane composition and specifically the PG content of bacterial membranes. Other noted mutations in various regulatory systems that control membrane homeostasis also support the cell membrane as the site of daptomycin action. Curiously, in _E. faecalis_, the most commonly observed form of daptomycin resistance is characterized by abnormal division septa, which supports the cell division-based mechanism of daptomycin action.[A231379, A231384]"
24,"Botulinum toxin A is indicated for a variety of conditions, depending on the preparations. Cosmetically, it is used for the treatment of facial fine lines and wrinkles, specifically for upper facial rhytides, including forehead, lateral canthus, and glabellar lines.[L32559]    In addition to the above indications, botulinum toxin A is used for the following conditions: treatment of adults with symptomatic overactive bladder with or without incontinence,  treatment of incontinence in adult patients who are not candidates for anticholinergic therapy, treatment of Neurogenic Detrusor Overactivity (NDO) in patients over 5 years who cannot undergo anticholinergic therapy.  Botulinum toxin A is indicated for the prevention of chronic migraines, for the treatment of muscle spasms, cervical dystonia, axillary hyperhidrosis, strabismus,[L32494] and disorders of the 7th cranial nerve.[L32569]    Off-label, botulinum toxin A is used for a variety of conditions such as temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders and myofascial pain[A231874], neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome, epicondylitis, post-stroke pain, post-herpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy, trigeminal neuralgia, neuropathic pain, spinal cord injury, and bladder pain.[A231879]In 2002, botulinum toxin A, also known as onabotulinumtoxinA or Botox, was the first type A botulism toxin to be introduced into the market for cosmetic use.[A231824] With a wide variety of applications and favourable safety profile, Botulinum toxin A injection is a minimally invasive and promising treatment for cosmetic imperfections, muscle spasms, and other conditions.[A231819,L32569] A popular use for Botox is the treatment of facial wrinkles and lines, however, there are many uses for the botulinum toxin A in the treatment of dystonia, incontinence, migraine, blepharospasm, and hyperhidrosis.[L32494,L32559]Botulinum toxin A inhibits the release of acetylcholine, relieving muscle contraction and spasm associated with many conditions, such as incontinence and dystonia. Cosmetically, botulinum toxin A paralyses muscles in the face to temporarily treat wrinkles.[A231844,L32559] The maximum effects of muscle paralysis occur four to seven days after a dose.[A231304]  When injected at therapeutic doses, botulinum toxin A causes partial chemical denervation of muscle tissue, causing local reduction of muscle activity. Muscle atrophy may result, axonal sprouting may begin, and extrajunctional acetylcholine receptors can be formed. Reinnervation of the muscle may occur, reversing muscle denervation caused by botulinum toxin A.[L32494]Botulinum toxin is a 150-kDa molecular weight protein consisting of a light chain (50 kDa) and heavy chain (100 kDa) linked by a single disulfide bond. The crystal structure reveals 3 lobes - the light chain, the amino-terminal portion of the heavy chain, and the carboxyl-terminal portion of the heavy chain.[A231854]    Botulinum toxin type A blocks neuromuscular transmission on motor or sympathetic nerve terminals, inhibiting the release of acetylcholine.[L32494] Botulinum toxins have actions on various regions: the neuromuscular junction, autonomic ganglia, and both postganglionic sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve endings. The heavy chain of the toxin binds selectively  at the presynaptic surface of cholinergic neurons in an irreversible fashion. After binding, the toxin-receptor complex is transported into the cell by endocytosis. The disulfide bond between the two chains is cleaved and the botulism toxin enters the cytoplasm. The light chain specifically interacts with SNAP-25 in the nerve terminals to block binding of acetylcholine vesicles with the cell membrane.  SNAP-25 is required for successful binding and release of acetylcholine from vesicles in nerve endings.[A231304]"
25,"Cyclosporine is approved for a variety of conditions. Firstly, it is approved for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in allogeneic kidney, liver, and heart transplants. It is also used to prevent bone marrow transplant rejection. For the above indications, cyclosporine can be used in conjunction with azathioprine and corticosteroids. Finally, cyclosporine can be used in patients who have chronic transplant rejection and have received previous immunosuppressive therapy[L3002] and to prevent or treat graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).[L11097]    Secondly, cyclosporine is used for the treatment of patients with severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) when they no longer respond to methotrexate alone.[L3734] It can be used for the treatment of adult non-immunocompromised patients with severe, recalcitrant, plaque psoriasis that have failed to respond to at least one systemic therapy or when systemic therapies are not tolerated or contraindicated.[L3734] The ophthalmic solution of cyclosporine is indicated to increase tear production in patients suffering from keratoconjunctivitis sicca.[L11097] In addition, cyclosporine is approved for the treatment of steroid dependent and steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome due to glomerular diseases which may include minimal change nephropathy, focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis or membranous glomerulonephritis.[L11097]    A cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion is indicated in the treatment of vernal keratoconjunctivitis in adults and children.[L34694]    Off-label, cyclosporine is commonly used for the treatment of various autoimmune and inflammatory conditions such as atopic dermatitis, blistering disorders, ulcerative colitis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, uveitis, connective tissue diseases, as well as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.[A139,A174085,A189393,A189396,A189399]Cyclosporine is a calcineurin inhibitor known for its immunomodulatory properties that prevent organ transplant rejection and treat various inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. It is isolated from the fungus _Beauveria nivea_.[A174049] Initially manufactured by Sandoz and approved for use by the FDA in 1983, cyclosporine is now available in various products by Novartis (previously known as Sandoz).[L11097,L3734,L11118]Cyclosporine exerts potent immunosuppressive actions on T cells, thereby prolonging survival following organ and bone marrow transplants.[L3734] This drug prevents and controls serious immune-mediated reactions including allograft rejection,  graft versus host disease, and inflammatory autoimmune disease.[L3734]    Some notable effects of cyclosporine are hypertrichosis, gingival hyperplasia, and hyperlipidemia. There is also some debate about this drug causing nephrotoxicity.[A189402]  Cyclosporine is a calcineurin inhibitor that inhibits T cell activation.[A174049,A174088,A189411] Its binding to the receptor cyclophilin-1 inside cells produces a complex known as cyclosporine-cyclophilin. This complex subsequently inhibits calcineurin, which in turn stops the dephosphorylation as well as the activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) that normally cause inflammatory reactions.  NF-AT is a transcription factor that promotes the production of cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, interferon-gamma and TNF-alpha, all of which are involved in the inflammatory process. Specifically, the inhibition of IL-2, which is necessary for T cell activation or proliferation, is believed to be responsible for cyclosporine's  immunosuppressive actions.[A174049,A189408] In addition to the above, the inhibition of NF-AT leads to lower levels of other factors associated with T helper cell function and thymocyte development.[A174049]"
26,"Octreotide by injection is used for the treatment of acromegaly and the reduction of flushing and diarrhea symptoms related to carcinoid tumors and/or vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIPoma) tumors.[L14513] The delayed-release oral formulation is used for the long-term treatment of acromegaly in patients who tolerate and respond adequately to injectable octreotide and [lanreotide].[L14507,L45528]Acromegaly is a disorder caused by excess growth hormone (GH), increasing the growth of body tissues and causing metabolic dysfunction.[L14501] In most cases, it results from an anterior pituitary growth hormone-releasing tumor. Typically, the feet, hands, and face grow abnormally large; organomegaly and insulin resistance may also occur. Acromegaly is a life-threatening disease requiring life-long management.[L14501]    Octreotide is a long-acting drug with pharmacologic activities that mimic those of the natural hormone, somatostatin, which inhibits the secretion of growth hormone.[L14513] Additionally, it is used for the treatment of acromegaly and symptoms arising from various tumors, including carcinoid tumors and vasoactive intestinal tumors (VIPomas).[L14513] In the past, octreotide has been administered solely by injection. On June 26, 2020, the first approved delayed-release oral somatostatin analog, Mycapssa, received FDA approval for the long term maintenance treatment of acromegaly. This drug was developed by Chiasma Inc.[L14495,L14507,L14528]Octreotide mimics the naturally occurring hormone known as somatostatin. Like somatostatin, it demonstrates activity against growth hormone and glucagon, treating the disordered tissue growth and insulin regulation in patients with acromegaly.[L14501,L14513] In addition, octreotide relieves the flushing and diarrhea associated with gastrointestinal tumors by reducing splanchnic blood flow[A214727] and various gastrointestinal hormones associated with diarrhea.[A214721]    Product labeling warns that octreotide may reduce gallbladder contractility, bile secretion, and the release of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in healthy volunteers.[L14513] In addition, reports of decreased vitamin B12 in patients treated with octreotide have been made. Ensure to monitor vitamin B12 levels in patients taking octreotide.[L14528]Octreotide binds to somatostatin receptors coupled to phospholipase C through G proteins and leads to smooth muscle contraction in the blood vessels.[L14519] Downstream effects that stimulate phospholipase C, the production of 1, 4,5-inositol triphosphate, and action on the L-type calcium channels lead to the inhibition of growth hormone, treating the various growth-hormone and metabolic effects of acromegaly.[L14519]    Octreotide's suppression of luteinizing hormone (LH)[A214724], reduction in splanchnic blood flow[A214727], and inhibition of serotonin, gastrin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, secretin, motilin, and pancreatic polypeptide provide relief for the gastrointestinal and flushing symptoms of carcinoid and/or VIPoma tumors.[A214721]"
27,"Administration of exogenous oxytocin is indicated in the antepartum period to initiate or improve uterine contractions for vaginal delivery in situations where there is fetal or maternal concern.[L31433] For example, It may be used to induce labor in cases of Rh sensitization, maternal diabetes, preeclampsia at or near term, and when delivery is indicated due to prematurely ruptured membranes.[A229018,L31433] Importantly, oxytocin is not approved or indicated for elective induction of labor. Oxytocin may be used to reinforce labor in select cases of uterine inertia and as adjunctive therapy in the management of incomplete or inevitable abortion. In the postpartum period, oxytocin may be used to induced contractions in the 3rd stage of labor and to control postpartum bleeding or hemorrhage.[L31433]Sir Henry H. Dale first identified oxytocin and its uterine contractile properties in 1906.[A229008,A228593,A229108] Like all other neurohypophysial hormones, oxytocin is composed of nine amino acids with a disulfide bridge between the Cys 1 and 6 residues.[A229008,A228593] In the mid-1950s, synthetic oxytocin was successfully synthesized by a biochemist named Vincent du Vigneaud; he was later recognized with a Nobel prize for his work.[A229108] Oxytocin continues to be an important tool in modern obstetrics to induce labor when indicated and to manage postpartum hemorrhage.[A229108,A229113] It is estimated that labor induction with oxytocin is used in almost 10% of deliveries globally.[A228593]     It should be noted that there are risks associated with oxytocin intervention during childbirth. Oxytocin should be used judiciously only when necessary and by experienced healthcare practitioners.[A229113]    Although most commonly linked to labor and delivery, oxytocin actually has broad peripheral and central effects.[A229008] It plays an important role in pair bonding, social cognition and functioning, and even fear conditioning.[A229013] Oxytocin also serves a role in metabolic homeostasis and cardiovascular regulation.[A228593,A229098]Oxytocin is a nonapeptide, pleiotropic hormone that exerts important physiological effects.[A228718, A228723] It is most well known to stimulate parturition and lactation, but also has important physiological influences on metabolic and cardiovascular functions, sexual and maternal behaviour, pair bonding, social cognition, and fear conditioning.[A228718,A228998,A229013]     It is worth noting that oxytocin receptors are not limited to the reproductive system but can be found in many peripheral tissues and in central nervous system structures including the brain stem and amygdala.[A228998,A229003,A229008,A229013]Oxytocin plays a vital role in labour and delivery.[A228928] The hormone is produced in the hypothalamus and is secreted from the paraventricular nucleus to the posterior pituitary where it is stored.[A228928,A228958] It is then released in pulses during childbirth to induce uterine contractions.[A228928]    The concentration of oxytocin receptors on the myometrium increases significantly during pregnancy and reaches a peak in early labor.[L31433] Activation of oxytocin receptors on the myometrium triggers a downstream cascade that leads to increased intracellular calcium in uterine myofibrils which strengthens and increases the frequency of uterine contractions.[L31433,A228958,A228718]    In humans, most hormones are regulated by negative feedback; however, oxytocin is one of the few that is regulated by positive feedback.[A228958] The head of the fetus pushing on the cervix signals the release of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary of the mother.[A228958] Oxytocin then travels to the uterus where it stimulates uterine contractions.[A228958] The elicited uterine contractions will then stimulate the release of increasing amounts of oxytocin.[A228958] This positive feedback loop will continue until parturition.[A228958]    Since exogenously administered and endogenously secreted oxytocin result in the same effects on the female reproductive system, synthetic oxytocin may be used in specific instances during the antepartum and postpartum period to induce or improve uterine contractions.[A228958,L31433]"

The human sequences were derived from the constant domains of human IgG1 and the variable framework regions of the Eu myeloma antibody. The murine sequences were derived from the complementarity-determining regions of a murine anti-Tac antibody.    On 22 April 2008, Roche Registration Limited chose to voluntarily withdraw the marketing authorization for their product Zenapax (daclizumab), as indicated for the prophylaxis of acute organ rejection in de novo allogeneic renal transplantation and used concomitantly with an immunosuppressive regimen like cyclosporine and corticosteroids in patients who are not hight immunized, for commercial reasons and confirmed that this decision was not related to any safety concerns associated with the use of Zenapax (daclizumab) [L1744]. Regardless of the withdrawal of Zenapax, Biogen and Abbvie's Zinbryta (daclizumab), as indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, was approved for use by the FDA in 2016 [L1746].     Despite being approved for use, Zinbryta (daclizumab)'s complex pre-existing safety profile consisting of its restricted availability through a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program [L1738] and its black box warning for possible hepatic injury, autoimmune hepatitis, and other immune mediated disorders [L1738] meant its therapeutic usage, adverse effects, and prescribing information was subject to continuous monitoring and updating.    Although Zinbryta (daclizumab) was available for patients as needed until 30 April 2018, Biogen and Abbvie announced a voluntary withdrawal of their product Zinbryta (daclizumab) from the global market on 2 March 2018 [L1738]. This withdrawal was concurrent to the European Medicines Agency announcement of a recall owing to 12 worldwide reports of serious inflammatory brain disorders associated with the use of Zinbryta (daclizumab) [L1738].Zenapax functions as an IL-2 receptor antagonist. Specifically it inhibits IL-2-mediated activation of lymphocytes, a critical pathway in the cellular immune response involved in allograft rejection.Zenepax binds with high-affinity to the Tac subunit of the high-affinity IL-2 receptor complex and inhibits IL-2 binding. The IL-2 receptor (Tac) subunit is expressed on activated but not resting lymphocytes."
29,"For nutritional supplementation and for treating dietary shortage or imbalance.This is the active form of vitamin B6 serving as a coenzyme for synthesis of amino acids, neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine), sphingolipids, aminolevulinic acid. During transamination of amino acids, pyridoxal phosphate is transiently converted into pyridoxamine phosphate (pyridoxamine).The two major forms of vitamin B6 are pyridoxine and pyridoxamine. In the liver they are converted to pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) which is a cofactor in many reactions of amino acid metabolism. PLP also is necessary for the enzymatic reaction governing the release of glucose from glycogen. Pyroluria is one potential cause of vitamin B6 deficiency.Pyridoxal Phosphate is a coenzyme of many enzymatic reactions. It is the active form of vitamin B6 which comprises three natural organic compounds, pyridoxal, pyridoxamine and pyridoxine. Pyridoxal phosphate acts as a coenzyme in all transamination reactions, and in some   oxylation and deamination reactions of amino acids. The aldehyde group of pyridoxal phosphate forms a Schiff-base linkage with the epsilon-amino group of a specific lysine group of the aminotransferase enzyme. The alpha-amino group of the amino acid substrate displaces the epsilon-amino group of the active-site lysine residue. The resulting aldimine becomes deprotonated to become a quinoid intermediate, which in turn accepts a proton at a different position to become a ketimine. Ketimine becomes hydrolyzed so that the amino group remains on the protein complex. "
30,"The actions of supplemental L-histidine are entirely unclear. It may have some immunomodulatory as well as antioxidant activity. L-histidine may be indicated for use in some with rheumatoid arthritis. It is not indicated for treatment of anemia or uremia or for lowering serum cholesterol.An essential amino acid that is required for the production of histamine.Is found abundantly in hemoglobin; has been used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, allergic diseases, ulcers and anemia. A deficiency can cause poor hearing.Since the actions of supplemental L-histidine are unclear, any postulated mechanism is entirely speculative. However, some facts are known about L-histidine and some of its metabolites, such as histamine and trans-urocanic acid, which suggest that supplemental L-histidine may one day be shown to have immunomodulatory and/or antioxidant activities. Low free histidine has been found in the serum of some rheumatoid arthritis patients. Serum concentrations of other amino acids have been found to be normal in these patients. L-histidine is an excellent chelating agent for such metals as copper, iron and zinc. Copper and iron participate in a reaction (Fenton reaction) that generates potent reactive oxygen species that could be destructive to tissues, including joints. L-histidine is the obligate precursor of histamine, which is produced via the decarboxylation of the amino acid. In experimental animals, tissue histamine levels increase as the amount of dietary L-histidine increases. It is likely that this would be the case in humans as well. Histamine is known to possess immunomodulatory and antioxidant activity. Suppressor T cells have H2 receptors, and histamine activates them. Promotion of suppressor T cell activity could be beneficial in rheumatoid arthritis. Further, histamine has been shown to down-regulate the production of reactive oxygen species in phagocytic cells, such as monocytes, by binding to the H2 receptors on these cells. Decreased reactive oxygen species production by phagocytes could play antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory roles in such diseases as rheumatoid arthritis. This latter mechanism is the rationale for the use of histamine itself in several clinical trials studying histamine for the treatment of certain types of cancer and viral diseases. In these trials, down-regulation by histamine of reactive oxygen species formation appears to inhibit the suppression of natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, allowing these cells to be more effective in attacking cancer cells and virally infected cells."
31,"Used to treat vitamin C deficiency, scurvy, delayed wound and bone healing, urine acidification, and in general as an antioxidant. It has also been suggested to be an effective antiviral agent.A six carbon compound related to glucose. It is found naturally in citrus fruits and many vegetables. Ascorbic acid is an essential nutrient in human diets, and necessary to maintain connective tissue and bone. Its biologically active form, vitamin C, functions as a reducing agent and coenzyme in several metabolic pathways. Vitamin C is considered an antioxidant.Ascorbic Acid (vitamin C) is a water-soluble vitamin indicated for the prevention and treatment of scurvy, as ascorbic acid deficiency results in scurvy. Collagenous structures are primarily affected, and lesions develop in bones and blood vessels. Administration of ascorbic acid completely reverses the symptoms of ascorbic acid deficiency.In humans, an exogenous source of ascorbic acid is required for collagen formation and tissue repair by acting as a cofactor in the posttranslational formation of 4-hydroxyproline in -Xaa-Pro-Gly- sequences in collagens and other proteins. Ascorbic acid is reversibly oxidized to dehydroascorbic acid in the body. These two forms of the vitamin are believed to be important in oxidation-reduction reactions. The vitamin is involved in tyrosine metabolism, conversion of folic acid to folinic acid, carbohydrate metabolism, synthesis of lipids and proteins, iron metabolism, resistance to infections, and cellular respiration."
32,"Used for nutritional supplementation, also for treating dietary shortage or imbalance.    Used to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients 5 years of age and older [FDA Label].A non-essential amino acid present abundantly throughout the body and is involved in many metabolic processes. It is synthesized from glutamic acid and ammonia. It is the principal carrier of nitrogen in the body and is an important energy source for many cells. An oral formulation of L-glutamine was approved by the FDA in July 2017 for use in sickle cell disease [L892]. This oral formulation is marketed under the tradename Endari by Emmaus Medical.Like other amino acids, glutamine is biochemically important as a constituent of proteins. Glutamine is also crucial in nitrogen metabolism. Ammonia (formed by nitrogen fixation) is assimilated into organic compounds by converting glutamic acid to glutamine. The enzyme which accomplishes this is called glutamine synthetase. Glutamine can then be used as a nitrogen donor in the biosynthesis of many compounds, including other amino acids, purines, and pyrimidines.    L-glutamine improves nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) redox potential [FDA Label].Supplemental L-glutamine's possible immunomodulatory role may be accounted for in a number of ways. L-glutamine appears to play a major role in protecting the integrity of the gastrointestinal tract and, in particular, the large intestine. During catabolic states, the integrity of the intestinal mucosa may be compromised with consequent increased intestinal permeability and translocation of Gram-negative bacteria from the large intestine into the body. The demand for L-glutamine by the intestine, as well as by cells such as lymphocytes, appears to be much greater than that supplied by skeletal muscle, the major storage tissue for L-glutamine. L-glutamine is the preferred respiratory fuel for enterocytes, colonocytes and lymphocytes. Therefore, supplying supplemental L-glutamine under these conditions may do a number of things. For one, it may reverse the catabolic state by sparing skeletal muscle L-glutamine. It also may inhibit translocation of Gram-negative bacteria from the large intestine. L-glutamine helps maintain secretory IgA, which functions primarily by preventing the attachment of bacteria to mucosal cells. L-glutamine appears to be required to support the proliferation of mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes, as well as the production of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). It is also required for the maintenance of lymphokine-activated killer cells (LAK). L-glutamine can enhance phagocytosis by neutrophils and monocytes. It can lead to an increased synthesis of glutathione in the intestine, which may also play a role in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal mucosa by ameliorating oxidative stress. The exact mechanism of the possible immunomodulatory action of supplemental L-glutamine, however, remains unclear. It is conceivable that the major effect of L-glutamine occurs at the level of the intestine. Perhaps enteral L-glutamine acts directly on intestine-associated lymphoid tissue and stimulates overall immune function by that mechanism, without passing beyond the splanchnic bed.    The exact mechanism of L-glutamine's effect on NAD redox potential is unknown but is thought to involve increased amounts of reduced glutathione made available by glutamine supplementation [FDA Label]. This improvement in redox potential reduces the amount of oxidative damage which sickle red blood cells are more susceptible to. The reduction in cellular damage is thought to reduce chronic hemolysis and vaso-occlusive events."
33,"For nutritional supplementation, also for treating dietary shortage or imbalanceAdenosine phosphate, or adenylic acid, is an adenine nucleotide containing one phosphate group esterified to the sugar moiety in the 2&#39;-, 3&#39;-, or 5&#39;-position. Adenosine phosphate was withdrawn by the FDA since it was considered neither safe nor effective for its intended uses as a vasodilator and an anti-inflammatory.[L43937]Adenosine monophosphate, also known as 5'-adenylic acid and abbreviated AMP, is a nucleotide that is found in RNA. It is an ester of phosphoric acid with the nucleoside adenosine. AMP consists of the phosphate group, the pentose sugar ribose, and the nucleobase adenine. AMP is used as a dietary supplement to boost immune activity, and is also used as a substitute sweetener to aid in the maintenance of a low-calorie diet.Nucleotides such as Adenosine-5'-Monophosphate affect a number of immune functions, including the reversal of malnutrition and starvation-induced immunosuppression, the enhancement of T-cell maturation and function, the enhancement of natural killer cell activity, the improvement of delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity, helping resistance to such infectious agents as Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans, and finally the modulation of T-cell responses toward type 1 CD4 helper lymphocytes or Th1 cells. Studies have shown that mice fed a nucleotide-free diet have both impaired humoral and cellular immune responses. The addition of dietary nucleotides normalizes both types of responses. RNA, a delivery form of nucleotides, and ribonucleotides were used in these studies. The mechanism of the immune-enhancing activity of nucleic acids/nucleotides is not clear."
34,"Used to treat vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency, refractory rickets (vitamin D resistant rickets), familial hypophosphatemia and hypoparathyroidism, and in the management of hypocalcemia and renal osteodystrophy in patients with chronic renal failure undergoing dialysis. Also used in conjunction with calcium in the management and prevention of primary or corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis.Calcitriol is an active metabolite of vitamin D with 3 hydroxyl (OH) groups and is commonly referred to as 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, or 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub>. It is produced in the body after series of conversion steps of 7-dehydrocholesterol from exposure to UV light. 7-dehydrocholesterol is converted to [DB00169] (vitamin D3) in the skin, which is then converted to [DB00146] in the liver and kidneys. [DB00146] undergoes hydroxylation to form calcitriol via 1α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) activity [A26353]. Calcitriol is considered to be the most potent metabolite of vitamin D in humans [A3366]. Renal production of calcitriol is stimulated in response to PTH, low calcium and low phosphate [A26353]. Calcitriol plays a role in plasma calcium regulation in concert with parathyroid hormone (PTH) by enhancing absorption of dietary calcium and phosphate from the gastrointestinal tract, promoting renal tubular reabsorption of calcium in the kidneys, and stimulating the release of calcium stores from the skeletal system. In addition to promoting fatty acid synthesis and inhibiting lipolysis, calcitriol has been demonstrated to increase energy efficiency by suppressing UCP2 expression, which is modulated by signaling pathways of classical nuclear receptors (nVDR), where calcitriol acts as a natural ligand [A175615]. There is also evidence that calcitriol modulates the action of cytokines and may regulate immune and inflammatory response, cell turnover, cell differentiation [A26353].     Administered orally and intravenously, calcitriol is commonly used as a medication in the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism and resultant metabolic bone disease, hypocalcemia in patients undergoing chronic renal dialysis, and osteoporosis. It is also available in topical form for the treatment of mild to moderate plaque psoriasis in adults. Calcitriol is marketed under various trade names including Rocaltrol (Roche), Calcijex (Abbott) and Decostriol (Mibe, Jesalis).Calcitriol is a biologically active calcitrophic hormone with anti-osteoporotic, immunomodulatory, anticarcinogenic, antipsoriatic, antioxidant, and mood-modulatory activities. Its main sites of action are the intestine, bone, kidney and parathyroid hormone [FDA Label]. Calcitriol is a ligand for the vitamin D nuclear receptor, which is expressed in, but not limited to, gastrointestinal (GI) tissues, bones, and kidneys [A3366]. As an active form of vitamin D3, calcitriol elevates the plasma levels of calcium by stimulating intestinal calcium uptake, increasing reabsorption of calcium by the kidneys, and possibly increasing the release of calcium from skeletal stores. The duration of pharmacologic activity of a single dose of exogenous calcitriol is expected to be about 3 to 5 days [FDA Label].     In addition to its important role in calcium metabolism, other pharmacological effects of calcitriol have been studied in various conditions including cancer models. Various studies demonstrated expression of vitamin D receptors in cancer cell lines, including mouse myeloid leukemia cells [A3366]. Calcitriol has been found to induce differentiation and/or inhibit cell proliferation _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ in many cell types, such as malignant cell lines carcinomas of the breast, prostate, colon, skin, and brain, myeloid leukemia cells, and others [A3367]. In early human prostate cancer trials, administration of 1.5 µg/d calcitriol in male participants resulted in a reduction in the rate of PSA rise in most participants, however it was coincided with dose-limiting hypercalcemia in most participants [A3366]. Hypercalcemia and hypercalcuria were evident in numerous initial trials, and this may be due to these trials not testing the drug at concentrations that are active in preclinical systems [A3367]. Vitamin D deficiency has long been suspected to increase the susceptibility to tuberculosis. The active form of calcitriol, 1,25-(OH)2-D3, has been found to enhance the ability of mononuclear phagocytes to suppress the intracellular growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis 1,25-(OH)2-D3 has demonstrated beneficial effects in animal models of such autoimmune diseases as rheumatoid arthritis. Vitamin D appears to demonstrate both immune-enhancing and immunosuppressive effects.The mechanism of action of calcitriol in the treatment of psoriasis is accounted for by their antiproliferative activity for keratinocytes and their stimulation of epidermal cell differentiation. The anticarcinogenic activity of the active form of Calcitriol appears to be correlated with cellular vitamin D receptor (VDR) levels. Vitamin D receptors belong to the superfamily of steroid-hormone zinc-finger receptors. VDRs selectively bind 1,25-(OH)<sub>2</sub>-D3 and retinoic acid X receptor (RXR) to form a heterodimeric complex that interacts with specific DNA sequences known as vitamin D-responsive elements. VDRs are ligand-activated transcription factors. The receptors activate or repress the transcription of target genes upon binding their respective ligands. It is thought that the anticarcinogenic effect of Calcitriol is mediated via VDRs in cancer cells. The immunomodulatory activity of calcitriol is thought to be mediated by vitamin D receptors (VDRs) which are expressed constitutively in monocytes but induced upon activation of T and B lymphocytes. 1,25-(OH)2-D3 has also been found to enhance the activity of some vitamin D-receptor positive immune cells and to enhance the sensitivity of certain target cells to various cytokines secreted by immune cells.    A study suggests that calcitriol plays an immunoregulatry role by suppressing the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) expression in human Th9, a pro-inflammatory CD4 T cell subset [A175747]. This suppression subsequently leads to repressed expression of BATF, a transcription factor essential for Th9 [A175747]. Calcitriol has also been found to induce monocyte differentiation and to inhibit lymphocyte proliferation and production of cytokines, including interleukin IL-1 and IL-2, as well as to suppress immunoglobulin secretion by B lymphocytes. "
35,"Tryptophan may be useful in increasing serotonin production, promoting healthy sleep, managing depression by enhancing mental and emotional well-being, managing pain tolerance, and managing weight.An essential amino acid that is necessary for normal growth in infants and for nitrogen balance in adults. It is a precursor of indole alkaloids in plants. It is a precursor of serotonin (hence its use as an antidepressant and sleep aid). It can be a precursor to niacin, albeit inefficiently, in mammals.Tryptophan is critical for the production of the body's proteins, enzymes and muscle tissue. It is also essential for the production of niacin, the synthesis of the neurotransmitter serotonin and melatonin. Tryptophan supplements can be used as natural relaxants to help relieve insomnia. Tryptophan can also reduce anxiety and depression and has been shown to reduce the intensity of migraine headaches. Other promising indications include the relief of chronic pain, reduction of impulsivity or mania and the treatment of obsessive or compulsive disorders. Tryptophan also appears to help the immune system and can reduce the risk of cardiac spasms. Tryptophan deficiencies may lead to coronary artery spasms. Tryptophan is used as an essential nutrient in infant formulas and intravenous feeding. Tryptophan is marketed as a prescription drug (Tryptan) for those who do not seem to respond well to conventional antidepressants. It may also be used to treat those afflicted with seasonal affective disorder (a winter-onset depression). Tryptopan serves as the precursor for the synthesis of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) and melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine).A number of important side reactions occur during the catabolism of tryptophan on the pathway to acetoacetate. The first enzyme of the catabolic pathway is an iron porphyrin oxygenase that opens the indole ring. The latter enzyme is highly inducible, its concentration rising almost 10-fold on a diet high in tryptophan. Kynurenine is the first key branch point intermediate in the pathway. Kynurenine undergoes deamniation in a standard transamination reaction yielding kynurenic acid. Kynurenic acid and metabolites have been shown to act as antiexcitotoxics and anticonvulsives. A second side branch reaction produces anthranilic acid plus alanine. Another equivalent of alanine is produced further along the main catabolic pathway, and it is the production of these alanine residues that allows tryptophan to be classified among the glucogenic and ketogenic amino acids. The second important branch point converts kynurenine into 2-amino-3-carboxymuconic semialdehyde, which has two fates. The main flow of carbon elements from this intermediate is to glutarate. An important side reaction in liver is a transamination and several rearrangements to produce limited amounts of nicotinic acid, which leads to production of a small amount of NAD+ and NADP+."
36,"Ergocalciferol is indicated for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism, refractory rickets, and familial hypophosphatemia.[FDA label]    Hypoparathyroidism is the result of inadequate parathyroid hormone production that occurs due to the presence of damage or removal of the parathyroid glands. This condition produces decreased calcium and increased phosphorus levels.[L6082]    Rickets is a condition produced due to a deficiency in vitamin D, calcium or phosphorus. However, this condition can also be related to renal diseases. It is characterized to present weak or soft bones.[A177664]    Familial hypophosphatemia is characterized by the impaired transport of phosphate and an altered vitamin D metabolism in the kidneys. The presence of this condition can derive in the presence of osteomalacia, bone softening and rickets.[L6085]Ergocalciferol is an inactivated vitamin D analog.[A177526] It is synthesized by some plants in the presence of UVB light.[T577] The production of ergocalciferol was prompted by the identification of dietary deficiency, more specifically vitamin D, as the main causative factor for the development of rickets. Ergocalciferol was isolated for the first time from yeast in 1931 and its structure was elucidated in 1932.[T580]    Ergocalciferol is considered the first vitamin D analog and is differentiated from [cholecalciferol] by the presence of a double bond between C22 and C23 and the presence of a methyl group at C24. These modifications reduce the affinity of ergocalciferol for the vitamin D binding protein resulting in faster clearance, limits its activation, and alters its catabolism.[A177637]    The first approved product containing ergocalciferol under the FDA records was developed by US Pharm Holdings and was FDA approved in 1941.[L6058]After the activation of the vitamin D receptor, some of the biological changes produced by ergocalciferol include mobilization and accretion of calcium and phosphorus in the bone, absorption of calcium and phosphorus in the intestine, and reabsorption of calcium and phosphorus in the kidney.[T580]     Some other effects known to be produced due to the presence of vitamin D are osteoblast formation, fetus development, induction of pancreatic function, induction of neural function, improvement of immune function, cellular growth and cellular differentiation.[T580]    When compared to its vitamin D counterpart [cholecalciferol], ergocalciferol has been shown to present a reduced induction of calcidiol and hence, it is less potent.[A177529]    Ergocalciferol supplementation in patients with end-stage renal disease has been shown to generate a significant benefit in lab parameters of bone and mineral metabolism as well as improvement in glycemic control, serum albumin levels and reduced levels of inflammatory markers.[A177526]For its activity, ergocalciferol is required to be transformed to its major active circulating hydroxylated metabolite and transported to the target organs in order to bind to its target, the vitamin D receptor.[T580]    The activation of the vitamin D receptor is part of the vitamin D endocrine system and it is described by the production of a change in the transcription rates of the vitamin D receptor target genes.[T580] The target genes in the DNA affected by the presence of ergocalciferol are called vitamin D response elements which are dependent on co-modulators.[A177637]    The vitamin D receptor is a transcription factor and member of the steroid hormone nuclear receptor family. It presents a DNA binding domain (VDRE) that, when activated, recruits coregulatory complexes to regulate the genomic activity.[A177637]    Additionally, ergocalciferol presents nongenomic effects such as the stimulation of intestinal calcium transport via transcaltachia.[A177637]"
37,"Folic acid is indicated for the treatment of folic acid deficiency, megaloblastic anemia, and in anemias of nutritional origins, pregnancy, infancy, or childhood.Folic acid, also known as folate or Vitamin B9, is a member of the B vitamin family and an essential cofactor for enzymes involved in DNA and RNA synthesis. More specifically, folic acid is required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. Folic acid is particularly important during phases of rapid cell division, such as infancy, pregnancy, and erythropoiesis, and plays a protective factor in the development of cancer. As humans are unable to synthesize folic acid endogenously, diet and supplementation is necessary to prevent deficiencies. For example, folic acid is present in green vegetables, beans, avocado, and some fruits.[L5744]    In order to function within the body, folic acid must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted by anti-metabolite therapies such as [DB00563] as they function as DHFR inhibitors to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, and therefore prevent the formation of DHF and THF. When used in high doses such as for cancer therapy, or in low doses such as for Rheumatoid Arthritis or psoriasis, [DB00563] impedes the body's ability to create folic acid. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects. As a result, supplementation with 1-5mg of folic acid is recommended to prevent deficiency and a number of side effects associated with MTX therapy including mouth ulcers and gastrointestinal irritation. [DB00650] (also known as folinic acid) supplementation is typically used for high-dose MTX regimens for the treatment of cancer. Levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF) and are able to bypass DHFR reduction to act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF.    There are also several antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) that are associated with reduced serum and red blood cell folate, including [DB00564] (CBZ), [DB00252] (PHT), or barbiturates.[A37004] Folic acid is therefore often provided as supplementation to individuals using these medications, particularly to women of child-bearing age.     Inadequate folate levels can result in a number of health concerns including cardiovascular disease, megaloblastic anemias, cognitive deficiencies, and neural tube defects (NTDs). Folic acid is typically supplemented during pregnancy to prevent the development of NTDs and in individuals with alcoholism to prevent the development of neurological disorders, for example.Folic acid is a water-soluble B-complex vitamin found in foods such as liver, kidney, yeast, and leafy, green vegetables. Also known as folate or Vitamin B9, folic acid is an essential cofactor for enzymes involved in DNA and RNA synthesis. More specifically, folic acid is required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. Folic acid is the precursor of tetrahydrofolic acid, which is involved as a cofactor for transformylation reactions in the biosynthesis of purines and thymidylates of nucleic acids. Impairment of thymidylate synthesis in patients with folic acid deficiency is thought to account for the defective deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis that leads to megaloblast formation and megaloblastic and macrocytic anemias. Folic acid is particularly important during phases of rapid cell division, such as infancy, pregnancy, and erythropoiesis, and plays a protective factor in the development of cancer. As humans are unable to synthesize folic acid endogenously, diet and supplementation is necessary to prevent deficiencies. In order to function properly within the body, folic acid must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted by anti-metabolite therapies such as [DB00563] as they function as DHFR inhibitors to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, and therefore prevent the formation of DHF and THF.     In general, folate serum levels below 5 ng/mL indicate folate deficiency, and levels below 2 ng/mL usually result in megaloblastic anemia.Folic acid, as it is biochemically inactive, is converted to tetrahydrofolic acid and methyltetrahydrofolate by dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). These folic acid congeners are transported across cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis where they are needed to maintain normal erythropoiesis, synthesize purine and thymidylate nucleic acids, interconvert amino acids, methylate tRNA, and generate and use formate. Using vitamin B12 as a cofactor, folic acid can normalize high homocysteine levels by remethylation of homocysteine to methionine via methionine synthetase."
38,"For the treatment of vitamin A deficiency.Retinol and derivatives of retinol that play an essential role in metabolic functioning of the retina, the growth of and differentiation of epithelial tissue, the growth of bone, reproduction, and the immune response. Dietary vitamin A is derived from a variety of carotenoids found in plants. It is enriched in the liver, egg yolks, and the fat component of dairy products.Vitamin A is effective for the treatment of Vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A refers to a group of fat-soluble substances that are structurally related to and possess the biological activity of the parent substance of the group called all-trans retinol or retinol. Vitamin A plays vital roles in vision, epithelial differentiation, growth, reproduction, pattern formation during embryogenesis, bone development, hematopoiesis and brain development. It is also important for the maintenance of the proper functioning of the immune system.Vision:Vitamin A (all-trans retinol) is converted in the retina to the 11-cis-isomer of retinaldehyde or 11-cis-retinal. 11-cis-retinal functions in the retina in the transduction of light into the neural signals necessary for vision. 11-cis-retinal, while attached to opsin in rhodopsin is isomerized to all-trans-retinal by light. This is the event that triggers the nerve impulse to the brain which allows for the perception of light. All-trans-retinal is then released from opsin and reduced to all-rans-retinol. All-trans-retinol is isomerized to 11-cis-retinol in the dark, and then oxidized to 11-cis-retinal. 11-cis-retinal recombines with opsin to re-form rhodopsin. Night blindness or defective vision at low illumination results from a failure to re-synthesize 11-cis retinal rapidly. Epithelial differentiation: The role of Vitamin A in epithelial differentiation, as well as in other physiological processes, involves the binding of Vitamin A to two families of nuclear retinoid receptors (retinoic acid receptors, RARs; and retinoid-X receptors, RXRs). These receptors function as ligand-activated transcription factors that modulate gene transcription. When there is not enough Vitamin A to bind these receptors, natural cell differentiation and growth are interrupted."
39,"Cholecalciferol use is indicated for the treatment of specific medical conditions like refractory rickets (or vitamin D resistant rickets), hypoparathyroidism, and familial hypophosphatemia [F4027, F4042].    Concurrently, as one of the most commonly utilized forms of vitamin D, cholecalciferol is also very frequently used as a supplement in individuals to maintain sufficient vitamin d levels in the body or to treat vitamin D deficiency, as well as various medical conditions that can be associated directly or indirectly with vitamin d insufficiency like osteoporosis and chronic kidney disease, among others [A176041, A176044, F4051].Vitamin D, in general, is a secosteroid generated in the skin when 7-dehydrocholesterol located there interacts with ultraviolet irradiation - like that commonly found in sunlight [L5689]. Both the endogenous form of vitamin D (that results from 7-dehydrocholesterol transformation), vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), and the plant-derived form, vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol), are considered the main forms of vitamin d and are found in various types of food for daily intake [L5689]. Structurally, ergocalciferol differs from cholecalciferol in that it possesses a double bond between C22 and C23 and has an additional methyl group at C24 [L5689]. Finally, ergocalciferol is pharmacologically less potent than cholecalciferol, which makes vitamin D3 the preferred agent for medical use [L5689].    Appropriate levels of vitamin D must be upheld in the body in order to maintain calcium and phosphorus levels in a healthy physiologic range to sustain a variety of metabolic functions, transcription regulation, and bone metabolism [A223, L5689, L1782, L5771, F4027, F4042, F4048]. However, studies are also ongoing to determine whether or not cholecalciferol may also play certain roles in cancer, autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular disease, and other medical conditions that may be associated with vitamin D deficiency [L5689].The in vivo synthesis of the predominant two biologically active metabolites of vitamin D occurs in two steps. The first hydroxylation of vitamin D3 cholecalciferol (or D2) occurs in the liver to yield 25-hydroxyvitamin D while the second hydroxylation happens in the kidneys to give 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D [F4027, F4042, F4048]. These vitamin D metabolites subsequently facilitate the active absorption of calcium and phosphorus in the small intestine, serving to increase serum calcium and phosphate levels sufficiently to allow bone mineralization [F4027, F4042, F4048]. Conversely, these vitamin D metabolites also assist in mobilizing calcium and phosphate from bone and likely increase the reabsorption of calcium and perhaps also of phosphate via the renal tubules [F4027, F4042, F4048]. There exists a period of 10 to 24 hours between the administration of cholecalciferol and the initiation of its action in the body due to the necessity of synthesis of the active vitamin D metabolites in the liver and kidneys [F4027, F4042, F4048]. It is parathyroid hormone that is responsible for the regulation of such metabolism at the level of the kidneys [F4027, F4042, F4048].Most individuals naturally generate adequate amounts of vitamin D through ordinary dietary intake of vitamin D (in some foods like eggs, fish, and cheese) and natural photochemical conversion of the vitamin D3 precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin via exposure to sunlight [L5689, F4027, F4042, F4048].    Conversely, vitamin D deficiency can often occur from a combination of insufficient exposure to sunlight, inadequate dietary intake of vitamin D, genetic defects with endogenous vitamin D receptor, or even severe liver or kidney disease [A243]. Such deficiency is known for resulting in conditions like rickets or osteomalacia, all of which reflect inadequate mineralization of bone, enhanced compensatory skeletal demineralization, resultant decreased calcium ion blood concentrations, and increases in the production and secretion of parathyroid hormone [A223]. Increases in parathyroid hormone stimulate the mobilization of skeletal calcium and the renal excretion of phosphorus [A223]. This enhanced mobilization of skeletal calcium leads towards porotic bone conditions [A223].    Ordinarily, while vitamin D3 is made naturally via photochemical processes in the skin, both itself and vitamin D2 can be found in various food and pharmaceutical sources as dietary supplements. The principal biological function of vitamin D is the maintenance of normal levels of serum calcium and phosphorus in the bloodstream by enhancing the efficacy of the small intestine to absorb these minerals from the diet [A223]. At the liver, vitamin D3 or D2 is hydroxylated to 25-hydroxyvitamin D and then finally to the primary active metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in the kidney via further hydroxylation [A223, A243]. This final metabolite binds to endogenous vitamin d receptors, which results in a variety of regulatory roles - including maintaining  calcium balance, the regulation of parathyroid hormone, the promotion of the renal reabsorption of calcium, increased intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus, and increased calcium and phosphorus mobilization of calcium and phosphorus from bone to plasma to maintain balanced levels of each in bone and the plasma [A223, A243].    In particular, calcitriol interacts with vitamin D receptors in the small intestine to enhance the efficiency of intestinal calcium and phosphorous absorption from about 10-15% to 30-40% and 60% increased to 80%, respectively [L5689]. Furthermore, calcitriol binds with vitamin D receptors in osteoblasts to stimulate a receptor activator of nuclear factor kB ligand (or RANKL) which subsequently interacts with receptor activator of nuclear factor kB (NFkB) on immature preosteoclasts, causing them to become mature bone-resorbing osteoclasts [L5689]. Such mature osteoclasts ultimately function in removing calcium and phosphorus from bone to maintain blood calcium and phosphorus levels [L5689]. Moreover, calcitriol also stimulates calcium reabsorption from the glomerular filtrate in the kidneys [L5689].    Additionally, it is believed that when calcitriol binds with nuclear vitamin D receptors, that this bound complex itself binds to retinoic acid X receptor (RXR) to generate a heterodimeric complex that consequently binds to specific nucleotide sequences in the DNA called vitamin D response elements [L5689]. When bound, various transcription factors attach to this complex, resulting in either up or down-regulation of the associated gene's activity. It is thought that there may be as much as 200 to 2000 genes that possess vitamin D response elements or that are influenced indirectly to control a multitude of genes across the genome [L5689].  It is in this way that cholecalciferol is believed to function in regulating gene transcription associated with cancer risk, autoimmune disorders, and cardiovascular disease linked to vitamin D deficiency [L5689]. In fact, there has been some research to suggest calcitriol may also be able to prevent malignancies by inducing cellular maturation and inducing apoptosis and inhibiting angiogenesis, exhibit anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting foam cell formation and promoting angiogenesis in endothelial colony-forming cells in vitro, inhibit immune reactions by enhancing the transcription of endogenous antibiotics like cathelicidin and regulate the activity and differentiation of CD4+ T cells, amongst a variety of other proposed actions [L5689].   "
40,"The primary known function of vitamin K is to assist in the normal clotting of blood, but it may also play a role in normal bone calcification.A synthetic naphthoquinone without the isoprenoid side chain and biological activity, but can be converted to active vitamin K2, menaquinone, after alkylation in vivo.Menadione (Vitamin K3) is a fat-soluble vitamin precursor that is converted into menaquinone in the liver. Vitamin K1 and K2 are the naturally occurring types of vitamin K. The former, which is also known as phylloquinone, is synthesized by plants and can be found in such foods as spinach, broccoli, lettuce, and soybeans. The latter, sometimes alternatively referred to as menaquinone, is primarily produced by bacteria in the anterior part of the gut and the intestines. Vitamin K3, on the other hand, is one of the many manmade versions of vitamin K. Also called menadione, this yellowish, synthetic crystalline substance is converted into the active form of the K2 vitamin inside of the animal body. While a vitamin K deficiency can be dangerous, especially to infants that may easily suffer from extensive hemorrhaging, an overdose can be as equally detrimental. Newborns that are administered too great a dosage of vitamin K3 can suffer from kernicterus, a form of severe brain damage that may produce decreased movement, loss of appetite, seizures, deafness, mental retardation, and even death. This condition is associated with an abnormally high concentration of bilirubin, a bile pigment, in the tissues of the brain, which can be caused by the presence of K3. For this reason, K3 is less often utilized medically than it was in former times.Menadione (vitamin K3) is involved as a cofactor in the posttranslational gamma-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues of certain proteins in the body. These proteins include the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors II (prothrombin), VII (proconvertin), IX (Christmas factor), X (Stuart factor), protein C, protein S, protein Zv and a growth-arrest-specific factor (Gas6). In contrast to the other vitamin K-dependent proteins in the blood coagulation cascade, protein C and protein S serve anticoagulant roles. The two vitamin K-dependent proteins found in bone are osteocalcin, also known as bone G1a (gamma-carboxyglutamate) protein or BGP, and the matrix G1a protein or MGP. Gamma-carboxylation is catalyzed by the vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylases. The reduced form of vitamin K, vitamin K hydroquinone, is the actual cofactor for the gamma-carboxylases. Proteins containing gamma-carboxyglutamate are called G1a proteins."
41,"For nutritional supplementation, also for treating dietary shortage or imbalanceAn adenine nucleotide containing three phosphate groups esterified to the sugar moiety. In addition to its crucial roles in metabolism adenosine triphosphate is a neurotransmitter.Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the nucleotide known in biochemistry as the ""molecular currency"" of intracellular energy transfer; that is, ATP is able to store and transport chemical energy within cells. ATP also plays an important role in the synthesis of nucleic acids. The total quantity of ATP in the human body is about 0.1 mole. The energy used by human cells requires the hydrolysis of 200 to 300 moles of ATP daily. This means that each ATP molecule is recycled 2000 to 3000 times during a single day. ATP cannot be stored, hence its consumption must closely follow its synthesis.ATP is able to store and transport chemical energy within cells.

42,"Pravastatin is indicated for primary prevention of coronary events hypercholesterolemic patients without clinical evidence of coronary heart disease. Its use includes the reduction of risk on myocardial infarction, undergoing myocardial revascularization procedures and cardiovascular mortality.[T274]    As well, pravastatin can be used as a secondary prevention agent for cardiovascular events in patients with clinically evident coronary heart disease. This indication includes the reduction of risk of total mortality by reducing coronary death, myocardial infarction, undergoing myocardial revascularization procedures, stroke, and stroke/transient ischemic attack as well as to slow the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.[T274]    The term cardiovascular events correspond to all the incidents that can produce damage to the heart muscle including the interruption of blood flow.[L6028]    As adjunctive therapy to diet, pravastatin is used in:    - Patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemias including hyperlipidemia type IIa and IIb.  - Patients with elevated serum triglycerides including type IV hyperlipidemia.  - Patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in patients over 8 years of age with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol higher than 190 mg/dl after diet modifications or LDL levels higher than 160 mg/dl and familial history of premature cardiovascular diseases or at least two cardiovascular risk factors.[T274]    In patients that do not respond adequately to diet, pravastatin is used to treat patients with primary dysbetalipoproteinemia (type III hyperlipidemia).[T274]     Dyslipidemia is defined as an elevation of plasma cholesterol, triglycerides or both as well as to the presence of low levels of high-density lipoprotein. This condition represents an increased risk for the development of atherosclerosis.[L6025]Pravastatin is the 6-alpha-hydroxy acid form of [mevastatin].[T303] Pravastatin was firstly approved in 1991 becoming the second available statin in the United States. It was the first statin administered as the active form and not as a prodrug.[T274] This drug was developed by Sankyo Co. Ltd.; however, the first approved pravastatin product was developed by Bristol Myers Squibb and FDA approved in 1991.[L6142]    Pravastatin is made through a fermentation process in which [mevastatin] is first obtained. The manufacturing process is followed by the hydrolysis of the lactone group and the biological hydroxylation with _Streptomyces carbophilus_ to introduce the allylic 6-alcohol group.[T239]The action of pravastatin on the 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase produces an increase in the expression of hepatic LDL receptors which in order decreases the plasma levels of LDL cholesterol.[T274]    The effect of pravastatin has been shown to significantly reduce the circulating total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B. As well, it modestly reduces very low-density-lipoproteins (VLDL) cholesterol and triglycerides while increasing the level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein A.[F4603]    In clinical trials with patients with a history of myocardial infarction or angina with high total cholesterol, pravastatin decreased the level of total cholesterol by 18%, decreased of LDL by 27%, decreased of triglycerides by 6% and increased of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) by 4%. As well, there was reported a decrease in risk of death due to coronary disease of 24%.[A177682]     When coadministered with [cholestyramine], pravastatin can reduce by 50% the levels of LDL and slow the progression of atherosclerosis and the risk of myocardial infarction and death.[T274]Pravastatin is a specific inhibitor of the hepatic HMG-CoA reductase in humans.[T274] The inhibition of this enzyme produces a reduction in cholesterol biosynthesis as HMG-CoA reductase activity is an early-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.[A177397]    The inhibitory mechanism of action produces a reduction in cholesterol synthesis which in order has been observed to increase the number of LDL receptors on cell surfaces and an enhancement in receptor-mediated metabolism of LDL and clearance.[A177415]    On the other hand, pravastatin-driven inhibition of LDL production inhibits hepatic synthesis of VLDL as the LDL is the precursor for these molecules.[A177436]"
43,"Valsartan is indicated for the treatment of hypertension to reduce the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. It is also indicated for the treatment of heart failure (NYHA class II-IV) and for left ventricular dysfunction or failure after myocardial infarction when the use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) is not appropriate.[L36445]Valsartan belongs to the angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) family of drugs, which also includes [telmisartan], [candesartan], [losartan], [olmesartan], and [irbesartan]. ARBs selectively bind to angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1) and prevent the protein angiotensin II from binding and exerting its hypertensive effects, which include vasoconstriction, stimulation and synthesis of aldosterone and ADH, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium, among others. Overall, valsartan's physiologic effects lead to reduced blood pressure, lower aldosterone levels, reduced cardiac activity, and increased excretion of sodium.     Valsartan also affects the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), which plays an important role in hemostasis and regulation of kidney, vascular, and cardiac functions. Pharmacological blockade of RAAS via  AT1 receptor blockade inhibits negative regulatory feedback within RAAS, which is a contributing factor to the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and renal disease. In particular, heart failure is associated with chronic activation of RAAS, leading to inappropriate fluid retention, vasoconstriction, and ultimately a further decline in left ventricular function. ARBs have been shown to have a protective effect on the heart by improving cardiac function, reducing afterload, increasing cardiac output and preventing ventricular hypertrophy and remodelling.[A174154]     By comparison, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) class of medications (which includes drugs such as [ramipril], [lisinopril], and [perindopril]) inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II through inhibition of the ACE enzyme. However, this does not prevent the formation of all angiotensin II within the body. The angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) family of drugs unique in that it blocks all angiotensin II activity, regardless of where or how it was synthesized.     Valsartan is commonly used for the management of hypertension, heart failure, and Type 2 Diabetes-associated nephropathy, particularly in patients who are unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors. ARBs such as valsartan have been shown in a number of large-scale clinical outcomes trials to improve cardiovascular outcomes including reducing risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, the progression of heart failure, and hospitalization.[A174124,A178153,A173869,A185324,A185327,A185333,A185342,A185345] Valsartan also slows the progression of diabetic nephropathy due to its renoprotective effects.[A174157,A174160,A174163] Improvements in chronic kidney disease with valsartan include both clinically and statistically significant decreases in urinary albumin and protein excretion in patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and in nondiabetic patients diagnosed with chronic kidney disease.[A174124,A173869]    Valsartan was initially approved in 1996 in Europe for the treatment of hypertension in adults. Shortly after, in 1997, this drug was approved in the United States.[A174124] Valsartan is generally well-tolerated with a side-effect profile superior to that of other antihypertensive drugs.[A174130,A174133]Valsartan inhibits the pressor effects of angiotensin II with oral doses of 80 mg inhibiting the pressor effect by about 80% at peak with approximately 30% inhibition persisting for 24 hours. Removal of the negative feedback of angiotensin II causes a 2- to 3-fold rise in plasma renin and consequent rise in angiotensin II plasma concentration in hypertensive patients. Minimal decreases in plasma aldosterone were observed after administration of valsartan.    In multiple-dose studies in hypertensive patients, valsartan had no notable effects on total cholesterol, fasting triglycerides, fasting serum glucose, or uric acid.[L11305]    **Hypotension**     Excessive hypotension was rarely seen (0.1%) in patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with valsartan alone. In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as volume- and/or salt-depleted patients receiving high doses of diuretics, symptomatic hypotension may occur. This condition should be corrected prior to administration of valsartan, or the treatment should start under close medical supervision.     Caution should be observed when initiating therapy in patients with heart failure. Patients with heart failure given valsartan commonly have some reduction in blood pressure, but discontinuation of therapy because of continuing symptomatic hypotension usually is not necessary when dosing instructions are followed. In controlled trials in heart failure patients, the incidence of hypotension in valsartan-treated patients was 5.5% compared to 1.8% in placebo-treated patients.     If excessive hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized.[L11305]      **Impaired Renal Function**    Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and by diuretics. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure on valsartan. Monitor renal function periodically in these patients. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on valsartan.[L11305]      **Hyperkalemia**    Some patients with heart failure have developed increases in potassium. These effects are usually minor and transient, and they are more likely to occur in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. Dosage reduction and/or discontinuation of valsartan may be required.[L11305]Valsartan belongs to the angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) family of drugs, which selectively bind to angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1) and prevent angiotensin II from binding and exerting its hypertensive effects.

Valsartan has about 20,000-fold higher affinity for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. The increased plasma levels of angiotensin II following AT1 receptor blockade with valsartan may stimulate the unblocked AT2 receptor.[L11305]"
44,"For the management of mild to severe hypertension. May be used to reduce cardiovascular mortality following myocardial infarction in hemodynamically stable individuals who develop clinical signs of congestive heart failure within a few days following myocardial infarction. [FDA Label] To reduce the rate of death, myocardial infarction and stroke in individuals at high risk of cardiovascular events. May be used to slow the progression of renal disease in individuals with hypertension, diabetes mellitus and microalubinuria or overt nephropathy. [T116] Ramipril is a prodrug belonging to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor class of medications. It is metabolized to ramiprilat in the liver and, to a lesser extent, kidneys. Ramiprilat is a potent, competitive inhibitor of ACE, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of angiotensin I (ATI) to angiotensin II (ATII). ATII regulates blood pressure and is a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Ramipril may be used in the treatment of hypertension, congestive heart failure, nephropathy, and to reduce the rate of death, myocardial infarction and stroke in individuals at high risk of cardiovascular events.Ramipril is an ACE inhibitor similar to benazepril, fosinopril and quinapril. [T116] It is an inactive prodrug that is converted to ramiprilat in the liver, the main site of activation, and kidneys. Ramiprilat confers blood pressure lowing effects by antagonizing the effect of the RAAS. The RAAS is a homeostatic mechanism for regulating hemodynamics, water and electrolyte balance. During sympathetic stimulation or when renal blood pressure or blood flow is reduced, renin is released from the granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. In the blood stream, renin cleaves circulating angiotensinogen to ATI, which is subsequently cleaved to ATII by ACE. ATII increases blood pressure using a number of mechanisms. First, it stimulates the secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone travels to the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and collecting tubule of nephrons where it increases sodium and water reabsorption by increasing the number of sodium channels and sodium-potassium ATPases on cell membranes. Second, ATII stimulates the secretion of vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone or ADH) from the posterior pituitary gland. ADH stimulates further water reabsorption from the kidneys via insertion of aquaporin-2 channels on the apical surface of cells of the DCT and collecting tubules. Third, ATII increases blood pressure through direct arterial vasoconstriction. Stimulation of the Type 1 ATII receptor on vascular smooth muscle cells leads to a cascade of events resulting in myocyte contraction and vasoconstriction. In addition to these major effects, ATII induces the thirst response via stimulation of hypothalamic neurons. ACE inhibitors inhibit the rapid conversion of ATI to ATII and antagonize RAAS-induced increases in blood pressure. ACE (also known as kininase II) is also involved in the enzymatic deactivation of bradykinin, a vasodilator. Inhibiting the deactivation of bradykinin increases bradykinin levels and may sustain the effects of ramiprilat by causing increased vasodilation and decreased blood pressure.Ramipril inhibits the RAAS system by binding to and inhibiting ACE thereby preventing the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. [T116] As plasma levels of angiotensin II fall, less activation of the G-protein coupled receptors angiotensin receptor I (AT1R) and angiotensin receptor II (AT2R) occurs.     AT1R mediates vasoconstriction, inflammation, fibrosis, and oxidative stress through a variety of signaling pathways. [T116] These include Gq coupling to the inositol triphosphate pathway, activation of phospholipases C, A2, and D which contribute to eicosanoid production, activation of Ca2+-dependent and MAP kinases, Giand G12/13, and eventual activation of the Jak/STAT pathway leading to cell growth and production of extracellular matrix components. AT1R activation also leads to increased activity of membrane-bound NADH/NADPH oxidase which contributes to production of reactive oxygen species. Decreased activation of this receptor mediates the renoprotective, antihypertensive, and cardioprotective effects of ramipril by reducing inflammation and vasoconstriction.    AT2R acts in opposition to the effects of AT1R by activating phosphotyrosine phosphatases which inhibit MAP kinases, inhibiting Ca2+ channel opening, and stimulating cGMP and nitric oxide production leading to vasodilation. [T116] These counteracting effects are shared by the Mas receptor which is activated by Ang(1-7), a subtype of angiotensin produced by plasma esterases from AngI or by ACE2 from AngII produced through a secondary pathway by tonin and cathepsin G. Ang(1-7) also activates AT2R although the bulk of its effect is mediated by MasR.    ACE is also responsible for the breakdown of bradykinin. [T116] The resulting buildup of bradykinin due to ACE inhibition is thought to mediate the characteristic dry-cough as a side effect of ACE inhibitor medications.    "

46,"Oral baclofen is indicated for the treatment of spasticity resulting from multiple sclerosis and is particularly useful for the relief of flexor spasms and concomitant pain, clonus, and muscular rigidity. It may also be used to treat patients with spinal cord injuries and other spinal cord diseases. Baclofen should not be used to treat skeletal muscle spasms resulting from rheumatic disorders.[L39434]    Intrathecal baclofen is also indicated for the management of severe spasticity of the cerebral or spinal original in patients 4 years of age and older. It is reserved for patients unresponsive to oral baclofen therapy, or those who experience intolerable central nervous system side effects at effective doses. For use in spasticity due to traumatic brain injury, baclofen should be considered after at least one year of injury.[L39429]Baclofen is a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist used as a skeletal muscle relaxant. Although originally designed in 1962 to treat epilepsy, baclofen was not effective in treating this condition but instead was shown to reduce spasticity in selected patients.[A245338] Baclofen was reintroduced in 1971 as a treatment for spasticity and was later approved by the FDA in 1977.[A245323, A245338] Baclofen is used to manage severe muscle spasms of cerebral or spinal cord origins, including multiple sclerosis and traumatic brain injury.[L39429]    Baclofen was investigated for use in alcohol dependence and withdrawal; however, evidence is limited and there is inconsistent evidence to suggest its clinical efficacy in managing alcohol dependence or withdrawal symptoms.[A173905, A173908, A245338]Baclofen is an antispasmodic agent that induces muscle relaxation. It reduces the release of excitatory neurotransmitters in the pre-synaptic neurons and stimulates inhibitory neuronal signals in the post-synaptic neurons.[A245323] Oral formulations of baclofen are the most commonly used form of the drug. In one cross-section study, intrathecal baclofen was more effective than oral baclofen in relieving spasticity directly at the level of the spinal cord.[A245338] Baclofen has CNS depression properties and can cause sedation with tolerance, somnolence, ataxia, and respiratory and cardiovascular depression.[L40134] Baclofen also mediates some antinociceptive effects and stimulates gastric acid secretion.[L40278]    Baclofen exhibits anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities: it inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from microglia and astrocytes, and decreases oxidative stress in rats.[A173938]The exact mechanism of action of baclofen is unclear. Baclofen is an agonist at the beta subunit of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors expressed on pre- and post-synaptic neurons.[A173923] Upon binding to GABAB receptors, baclofen causes an influx of potassium into the neuron, leading to hyperpolarization of the neuronal membrane and decreased calcium influx at presynaptic nerve terminals. This results in a decreased rate of action potential threshold being reached by presynaptic neurons and reduced action potential of postsynaptic motor neurons that innervate the muscle spindles. Baclofen thereby inhibits the transmission of both mono- and polysynaptic reflexes at the spinal cord, relaxing spasticity.[A245338] Baclofen may act on some voltage-gated calcium channels; however, the clinical significance of this is unclear.[A245323] "
47,"Amphetamine is indicated for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders (ADHD) as well as for the treatment of central nervous system disorders such as narcolepsy.[A18540]     ADHD is a complex disorder associated with the substantial heterogeneity in etiology, clinical presentation, and treatment outcome. ADHD comes from a complex interplay between interdependent genetic and non-genetic factors which cause complex mental disorders in children and teenagers.[A174271]    On the other hand, narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder typically resenting during adolescence and characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness.[A174274]    Amphetamine is also being used nowadays off-label for the treatment of obesity, depression and chronic pain.[A174268, A174283]Amphetamine, a compound discovered over 100 years ago, is one of the more restricted controlled drugs. It was previously used for a large variety of conditions and this changed until this point where its use is highly restricted. Amphetamine, with the chemical formula alpha-methylphenethylamine, was discovered in 1910 and first synthesized by 1927. After being proven to reduce drug-induced anesthesia and produce arousal and insomnia, amphetamine racemic mix was registered by Smith, Kline and French in 1935. Amphetamine structure presents one chiral center and it exists in the form of dextro- and levo-isomers.[A18540] The first product of Smith, Kline and French was approved by the FDA on 1976.[L5194]    During World War II, amphetamine was used to promote wakefulness in the soldiers. This use derived into a large overproduction of amphetamine and all the surplus after the war finalized ended up in the black market, producing the initiation of the illicit abuse.[A18540]From its mechanism of action, it has been demonstrated that amphetamine augments the concentration of noradrenaline in the prefrontal cortex and dopamine in the striatum on a dose and time-dependent manner. The indistinct release of neurotransmitters which include adrenaline is known to produce cardiovascular side effects.[A174214]     There are old reports of a cognitive enhancement related to the administration of amphetamine in which improvements in intelligence test scores were reported.[A174196]    In ADHD, amphetamine has been largely showed to produce remarkable improvements in school performance, behavior, and demeanor.[A18540] The effect was shown to be produced through both racemic forms and to this date, the use of racemic forms 3:1 (D:L) is very common.[A174199] The therapeutic effect of amphetamine on serotonin does not seem to have a significant clinical effect on ADHD as observed on comparative studies with amphetamine and fenfluramine, a powerful serotonin releasing factor. However, the indirect effect on serotonin might have an effect on the depression and anxiety profile of ADHD.[A174241]    Studies regarding the illicit use of amphetamine in which heavy consumers were studied proved the generation of a paranoid state which flagged this drug as a psychiatric danger compound.[L5197] This observation was supported by the continuous reports of misuse in patients under depression.[A18540]It is important to consider that amphetamine has a very similar structure to the catecholamine neurotransmitters mainly on the presence of a long planar conformation, the presence of an aromatic ring and nitrogen in the aryl side chain. Amphetamine, as well as other catecholamines, is taken into presynaptic nerve terminals by the association with two sodium ions and one chloride ion. The complex of the amphetamine with the ions is actively transported by monoamine reuptake transporters. As amphetamine acts competitively with the endogenous monoamines, the greater the number of amphetamines the more internalized amphetamine will be found.[A18540]    Once inside the presynaptic terminal, amphetamine displaces other monoamines to be stored by VMAT2 which produces the pumping of the neurotransmitters into the synapse by a process called retro-transport.[A174211] This process of release of neurotransmitters is approximately fourfold more potent in the d-isomer for the release of dopamine.[A174214]    The mechanism of action of amphetamine is complemented by the inhibition of the reuptake and of monoamine oxidase which acts synergistically to produce a significant increase the monoamine concentration.[A18540] This activity is not done as an inhibitor per se but more as a competitive substrate and thus, amphetamine is known to be a weak dopamine reuptake inhibitor, moderate noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor and very weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor. From this specific action, the l-isomer is known to be significantly less potent.[A174214]    Lastly, amphetamine is known to be an inhibitor of the mitochondrial-bound enzyme MAO which is the catalytic enzyme in charge of degrading all the excess of neurotransmitters. This mechanism of action is often overpassed as amphetamine is a weak MAO inhibitor but this mechanism cannot be dismissed.[A18540]"
48,"For the relief of nicotine withdrawal symptoms and as an aid to smoking cessation.Nicotine is highly toxic alkaloid. It is the prototypical agonist at nicotinic cholinergic receptors where it dramatically stimulates neurons and ultimately blocks synaptic transmission. Nicotine is also important medically because of its presence in tobacco smoke.Nicotine, the primary alkaloid in tobacco products binds stereo-selectively to nicotinic-cholinergic receptors on autonomic ganglia, the adrenal medulla, neuromuscular junctions and in the brain. Nicotine exerts two effects, a stimulant effect exerted at the locus ceruleus and a reward effect in the limbic system. Itranvenous administration of nicotine causes release of acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonine, vasopressin, beta-endorphin and ACTH. Nicotine is a highly addictive substance. Nicotine also induces peripheral vasoconstriction, tachycardia and elevated blood pressure. Nicotine inhalers and patches are used to treat smoking withdrawl syndrome. Nicotine is classified as a stimulant of autonomic ganglia.Nicotine is a stimulant drug that acts as an agonist at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. These are ionotropic receptors composed up of five homomeric or heteromeric subunits. In the brain, nicotine binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on dopaminergic neurons in the cortico-limbic pathways. This causes the channel to open and allow conductance of multiple cations including sodium, calcium, and potassium. This leads to depolarization, which activates voltage-gated calcium channels and allows more calcium to enter the axon terminal. Calcium stimulates vesicle trafficking towards the plasma membrane and the release of dopamine into the synapse. Dopamine binding to its receptors is responsible the euphoric and addictive properties of nicotine.  Nicotine also binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla. Binding opens the ion channel allowing influx of sodium, causing depolarization of the cell, which activates voltage-gated calcium channels. Calcium triggers the release of epinephrine from intracellular vesicles into the bloodstream, which causes vasoconstriction, increased blood pressure, increased heart rate, and increased blood sugar."
49,"For the treatment of symptoms of dry mouth in patients with Sj&ouml;gren's Syndrome.Cevimeline is a parasympathomimetic agent that act as an agonist at the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors M1 and M3. It is indicated by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of dry mouth associated with Sjögren's syndrome.Cevimeline is a cholinergic agonist which binds to muscarinic receptors. Muscarinic agonists in sufficient dosage can increase secretion of exocrine glands, such as salivary and sweat glands and increase tone of the smooth muscle in the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts.Muscarinic agonists such as cevimeline bind and activate the muscarinic M1 and M3 receptors. The M1 receptors are common in secretory glands (exocrine glands such as salivary and sweat glands), and their activation results in an increase in secretion from the secretory glands. The M3 receptors are found on smooth muscles and in many glands which help to stimulate secretion in salivary glands, and their activation generally results in smooth muscle contraction and increased glandular secretions. Therefore, as saliva excretion is increased, the symptoms of dry mouth are relieved."
50,"Lorazepam is FDA-approved for the short-term relief of anxiety symptoms related to anxiety disorders and anxiety associated with depressive symptoms such as anxiety-associated insomnia. It is as well used as an anesthesia premedication in adults to relieve anxiety or to produce sedation/amnesia and for the treatment of status epilepticus.[T385]    Some off-label indications of lorazepam include rapid tranquilization of an agitated patient, alcohol withdrawal delirium, alcohol withdrawal syndrome, muscle spasms, insomnia, panic disorder, delirium, chemotherapy-associated anticipatory nausea and vomiting, and psychogenic catatonia.[T385]Lorazepam is a short-acting and rapidly cleared benzodiazepine used commonly as a sedative and anxiolytic.[A957] It was developed by DJ Richards, presented and marketed initially by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals in the USA in 1977. The first historic FDA label approval is reported in 1985 by the company Mutual Pharm.[L5095]The effect of lorazepam in GABA-A receptors produces an increase in the frequency of opening of the chloride ion channel. However, for its effect to generate, the neurotransmitter is required.[A5415] The anticonvulsant properties of lorazepam are thought to be related to the binding to voltage-dependent sodium channels in which the sustained repetitive firing gets limited by the slow recovery of sodium channels due to the benzodiazepine effect.[A1240]    The effect of lorazepam seems to be very compartmental which was observed with a different generation of sleepiness and a dizziness effect.[A173920]Lorazepam allosterically binds on the benzodiazepine receptors in the post-synaptic GABA-A ligand-gated chloride channel in different sites of the central nervous system (CNS). This binding will result in an increase on the GABA inhibitory effects which is translated as an increase in the flow of chloride ions into the cell causing hyperpolarization and stabilization of the cellular plasma membrane.[T385]    According to the binding site of lorazepam, we can observe different activities as the binding in the amygdala is known to help mainly in anxiety disorders while the binding in the cerebral cortex helps in seizure disorders.[T385]"
51,"For the rapid control of ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter in perioperative, postoperative, or other emergent circumstances where short term control of ventricular rate with a short-acting agent is desirable. Also used in noncompensatory sinus tachycardia where the rapid heart rate requires specific intervention.Esmolol, commonly marketed under the trade name Brevibloc, is a cardioselective beta-1 receptor blocker. It has a rapid onset but short duration of action without causing significant intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilizing activities at recommended therapeutic doses. It works by blocking beta-adrenergic receptors in the heart, which leads to decreased force and rate of heart contractions. Esmolol prevents the action of two naturally occurring substances: epinephrine and norepinephrine.    The FDA withdrew its approval for the use of all parenteral dosage form drug products containing esmolol hydrochloride that supply 250 milligrams/milliliter of concentrated esmolol per 10-milliliter ampule. Other esmolol formulations are still available for use.[L43942]Similar to other beta-blockers, esmolol blocks the agonistic effect of the sympathetic neurotransmitters by competing for receptor binding sites. Because it predominantly blocks the beta-1 receptors in cardiac tissue, it is said to be cardioselective. In general, so-called cardioselective beta-blockers are relatively cardioselective; at lower doses they block beta-1 receptors only but begin to block beta-2 receptors as the dose increases. At therapeutic dosages, esmolol does not have intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) or membrane-stabilizing (quinidine-like) activity. Antiarrhythmic activity is due to blockade of adrenergic stimulation of cardiac pacemaker potentials. In the Vaughan Williams classification of antiarrhythmics, beta-blockers are considered to be class II agents."
52,"Bortezomib is indicated for the treatment of adults with multiple myeloma or mantle cell lymphoma.[L44341]Bortezomib is a dipeptide boronic acid derivative and proteasome inhibitor used to treat multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma.[A204083] The 26S proteasome is a protein complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway: reversible inhibition of the 26S proteasome, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of cancer cells, is thought to be the main mechanism of action of bortezomib.[L14180] However, multiple mechanisms may be involved in the anticancer activity of bortezomib.[A204083]    Bortezomib was first synthesized in 1995.[A204083] In May 2003, bortezomib became the first anticancer proteasome inhibitor that was approved by the FDA under the trade name VELCADE.[A204146] Phase I, II, III, and IV clinical trials are undergoing to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of bortezomib in leukemia, myasthenia gravis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and solid tumours.[A214307]Bortezomib works to target the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, an essential molecular pathway that regulates intracellular concentrations of proteins and promotes protein degradation.[A272] The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is often dysregulated in pathological conditions, leading to aberrant pathway signalling and the formation of malignant cells. In one study, patient-derived chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells contained 3-fold higher levels of chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity than normal lymphocytes.[A272] By reversibly inhibiting proteasome, bortezomib prevents proteasome-mediated proteolysis. Bortezomib exerts a cytotoxic effect on various cancer cell types _in vitro_ and delays tumour growth _in vivo_ in nonclinical tumour models.[L14177] Bortezomib inhibits the proteasome activity in a dose-dependent manner. In one pharmacodynamic study, more than 75% of proteasome inhibition was observed in whole blood samples within one hour after dosing of bortezomib.[A204083]The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is a homeostatic proteolytic pathway for intracellular protein degradation: proteins marked with a poly-ubiquitin chain are degraded to small peptides and free ubiquitin by the proteasome, which is a large multimeric protease.[A18508] Aberrant proteasome-dependent proteolysis, as seen in some malignancies, can lead to uncontrolled cell division, leading to tumorigenesis, cancer growth, and spread.[A18508, A204083]     Bortezomib is a reversible inhibitor of the 26S proteasome, which is made up of a 20S core complexed with a 19S regulatory complex. Individual β-subunits allow specific catalytic action of the 20S core.[A18509, A204083] In mammalian cells, bortezomib is a potent inhibitor of the proteasome’s chymotryptic-like activity, which is attributed to the β5-subunit of the 20S core particle.[A18509] Bortezomib binds to the active site of the threonine hydroxyl group in the β5-subunit.[A204083] A probing study showed bortezomib also binding to and inhibiting the β1-subunit, which mediates the caspase-like activity of the proteasome, and β1i-subunit, which is an altered subunit that is expressed to form immunoproteasomes in response to cell stress or inflammation.[A18509] By inhibiting the proteasome-mediated degradation of key proteins that promote cell apoptosis,[A18508] bortezomib induces a cell cycle arrest during the G2-M phase.[L14180] It is believed that multiple mechanisms, other than proteasome inhibition, may be involved in the anticancer activity of bortezomib.[A204083] The anticancer activity of bortezomib was largely associated with suppression of the NF-κB signalling pathway, resulting in the downregulation of anti-apoptotic target genes and expression of anti-apoptic proteins. This may be explained by bortezomib preventing uncontrolled degradation of IκB, which is an inhibitory protein of NF-κB. NOXA, which is a pro-apoptotic factor, induced by bortezomib selectively in cancer cells; thus, it is suggested to be another key mechanism of bortezomib.[A204083]"
53,"Used for short-term hypnotic therapy in the management of insomnia for periods of up to one week in duration; however, this medication generally has been replaced by other sedative-hypnotic agents.Ethchlorvynol is a sedative and hypnotic drug. It has been used to treat insomnia, but has been largely superseded and is only offered where an intolerance or allergy to other drugs exists.Ethchlorvynol is a sedative drug and schedule IV (USA) controlled substance. It produces cerebral depression, however the exact mechanism of action is not known.Although the exact mechanism of action is unknown, ethchlorvynol appears to depress the central nervous system in a manner similar to that of barbiturates. Barbiturates bind at a distinct binding sites associated with a Cl- ionopore at the GABAA receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl- ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged."
54,"[FDA label]Carbidopa presents a chemical denomination of N-amino-alpha-methyl-3-hydroxy-L-tyrosine monohydrate. It potently inhibits aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (DDC) and due to its chemical properties, it does not cross the blood-brain barrier. Due to its activity, carbidopa is always administered concomitantly with [levodopa]. An individual formulation containing solely carbidopa was generated to treat nausea in patients where the combination therapy [levodopa]/carbidopa is not efficient reducing nausea. This results in an increased amount of [levodopa] and [oxitriptan] available for transport to the central nervous system. Carbidopa also inhibits the metabolism of [levodopa] in the GI tract, thus, increasing the bioavailability of [levodopa].[A13607]    The presence of additional units of circulating [levodopa] can increase the effectiveness of the still functional dopaminergic neurons and it has been shown to alleviate symptoms for a time. The action of carbidopa is very important as [levodopa] is able to cross the blood-brain barrier while dopamine cannot.[T28] Hence the administration of carbidopa is essential to prevent the transformation of external [levodopa] to dopamine before reaching the main action site in the brain.This effect has been highly observed by a significant reduction in [levodopa] requirements and a significant reduction in the presence of side effects such as nausea. It has been observed that the effect of carbidopa is not dose-dependent.[T394]Carbidopa is an inhibitor of the DDC which in order, inhibits the peripheral metabolism of levodopa.[A173935] DDC is very important in the biosynthesis of L-tryptophan to serotonin and the modification of L-DOPA to dopamine.[A13607]     DDC can be found in the body periphery and in the blood-brain barrier.[A13607] The action of carbidopa is focused on peripheral DDC as this drug cannot cross the blood-brain barrier.[T28] Hence, it will prevent the metabolism of [levodopa] in the periphery but it will not have any activity on the generation of dopamine in the brain."
55,"Phentermine is indicated, alone or in combination with topiramate, as a short-term adjunct, not pass a few weeks, in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modifications and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity for patients with an initial body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 kg/m2 or greater than 27 kg/m2 in presence of other risk factors such as controller hypertension, diabetes or hyperlipidemia.[FDA label]    Exogenous obesity is considered when the overweight is caused by consuming more food than the person activity level warrants. This condition commonly causes an increase in fat storage. It is an epidemic condition in the United States where over two-thirds of adults are overweight or obese and one in three Americans is obese. In the world, the incidence of obesity has nearly doubled.[A174391]Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine anorectic agent and it was introduced in 1959 as part of an anti-obesity combination drug.[A174361, A174364] It is chemically related to amphetamine and it is commonly referred to as an atypical amphetamine.[A174370] Phentermine has not been reported an addictive potential which allows this agent to be classified under the Schedule IV drugs (low abuse potential).[A174367]    Phentermine was FDA approved for short-term weight management in 1959 and it became widely used in 1960.[A174373]It is reported that the main mechanism of action of phentermine is the generation of appetite suppression, maybe due to the increase in leptin, but it is considered that other mechanisms should be involved.[A174370] Some reports have indicated that the weight loss effect is mainly due to the increase in resting energy expenditure.[A174367]    In clinical studies where phentermine was used as a monotherapy and as combination therapy, this drug has shown an average weight loss of 3.6 kg when compared with the placebo in 2-24 weeks. Patients treated with phentermine also showed increased maintenance of the weight after treatment discontinuation.[A174367] As well, even though it is a derivative of the amphetamines, it has not been registered to produce any of the effects of amphetamine such as central nervous system stimulation, elevation of blood pressure, tachyphylaxis or QTc prolongation.[A174370]Phentermine is an indirect-acting sympathomimetic agent that acts by releasing noradrenaline from the presynaptic vesicles in the lateral hypothalamus. This increase in noradrenaline concentration in the synaptic cleft results in the stimulation of beta2-adrenergic receptors.[A174367] Phentermine is classified as an indirect sympathomimetic due to the increase in the level of norepinephrine, dopamine and its indirect effect towards serotonin.[L5233] Some reports have indicated that phentermine inhibits the neuropeptide Y which is a principal signaling pathway for the induction of hunger.[T403] This combined effect produces a continuous flight-or-fight response in the body which reduces the hunger signal as this state is on the immediate need for energy.[T403]    Lastly, some reports have indicated that phentermine is a weak inhibitor of monoamine oxidase but this mechanism does not tend to produce a clinically significant response.[T49]"
56,"Tramadol is approved for the management of moderate to severe pain in adults.[L9257,F4679]    Tramadol is also used off-label in the treatment of premature ejaculation.[A173986]Tramadol is a centrally acting synthetic opioid analgesic and SNRI (serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake-inhibitor) that is structurally related to [codeine] and [morphine]. Due to its good tolerability profile and multimodal mechanism of action, tramadol is generally considered a lower-risk opioid option for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. It is considered a Step 2 option on the World Health Organization's pain ladder and has about 1/10th of the potency of [morphine].     Tramadol differs from other traditional opioid medications in that it doesn't just act as a μ-opioid agonist, but also affects monoamines by modulating the effects of neurotransmitters involved in the modulation of pain such as serotonin and norepinpehrine which activate descending pain inhibitory pathways.[A182279] Tramadol's effects on serotonin and norepinephrine mimic the effects of other SNRI antidepressants such as [duloxetine] and [venlafaxine].    Tramadol exists as a racemic mixture consisting of two pharmacologically active enantiomers that both contribute to its analgesic property through different mechanisms and are also themselves metabolized into active metabolites: (+)-tramadol and its primary metabolite (+)-O-desmethyl-tramadol (M1) are agonists of the μ opioid receptor while (+)-tramadol inhibits serotonin reuptake and (-)-tramadol inhibits norepinephrine reuptake. These pathways are complementary and synergistic, improving tramadol's ability to modulate the perception of and response to pain.[A4269,A183842]     Tramadol has also been shown to affect a number of other pain modulators within the central nervous system as well as non-neuronal inflammatory markers and immune mediators.[A183728,A183734,A183761,A17159,A182300] Due to the broad spectrum of targets involved in pain and inflammation, it's not surprising that the evidence has shown that tramadol is effective for a number of pain types including neuropathic pain, post-operative pain, lower back pain, as well as pain associated with labour, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, and cancer. Due to its SNRI activity, tramadol also has anxiolytic, antidepressant, and anti-shivering effects which are all frequently found as comorbidities with pain.[A182300]    Similar to other opioid medications, tramadol poses a risk for development of tolerance, dependence and abuse.[A183836,A179926]Tramadol modulates the descending pain pathways within the central nervous system through the binding of parent and M1 metabolite to μ-opioid receptors and the weak inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.[A173983,A173980]     Apart from analgesia, tramadol may produce a constellation of symptoms (including dizziness, somnolence, nausea, constipation, sweating and pruritus) similar to that of other opioids.     **Central Nervous System**    In contrast to [morphine], tramadol has not been shown to cause histamine release. At therapeutic doses, tramadol has no effect on heart rate, left-ventricular function or cardiac index. Orthostatic hypotension has been observed.[L9257]    Tramadol produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centres. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem centres to increases in CO2 tension and to electrical stimulation.     Tramadol depresses the cough reflex by a direct effect on the cough centre in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia.    Tramadol causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but  are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce  similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of  oxycodone overdose.[F4679]    Seizures have been reported in patients receiving tramadol within the recommended dosage range. Spontaneous post-marketing reports indicate that seizure risk is increased with doses of tramadol above the recommended range. Risk of convulsions may also increase in patients with epilepsy, those with a history of seizures  or in patients with a recognized risk for seizure (such as head trauma, metabolic disorders,  alcohol and drug withdrawal, CNS infections), or with concomitant use of other drugs known to reduce the seizure threshold.[F4679]    Tramadol can cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs (e.g., anti-depressants, migraine medications). Treatment with the serotoninergic drug should be discontinued if such events (characterized by clusters of symptoms such as hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuations of vital signs, mental status changes including confusion, irritability, extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma) occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated.[F4679]    **Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle**    Tramadol causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.[F4679]    **Endocrine System**    Opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal or -gonadal axes. Some changes that can be seen include an increase in serum prolactin and decreases in plasma cortisol and testosterone. Clinical signs and symptoms may be manifest from these hormonal changesIn some reports, hyponatremia appeared to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) and resolved with discontinuation of tramadol and appropriate treatment (e.g., fluid restriction). During tramadol treatment, monitoring for signs and symptoms of hyponatremia is recommended for patients with predisposing risk factors. These patients should be monitored for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of tramadol.[F4679]    **QTc-Interval Prolongation**    The maximum placebo-adjusted mean change from baseline in the QTcF interval was 5.5 ms in the 400 mg/day treatment arm and 6.5 ms in the 600 mg/day mg treatment arm, both occurring at the 8h time point. Both treatment groups were within the 10 ms threshold for QT prolongation. Post-marketing experience with the use of tramadol containing products included rare reports of QT prolongation reported with an overdose. Particular care should be exercised when administering tramadol to patients who are suspected to be at an increased risk of experiencing torsade de pointes during treatment with a QTc-prolonging drug.Therefore, tramadol should be prescribed and handled with caution.[F4679]Tramadol is a centrally acting μ-opioid receptor agonist and SNRI (serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake-inhibitor) that is structurally related to [codeine] and [morphine]. Tramadol binds weakly to κ- and δ-opioid receptors and to the μ-opioid receptor with 6000-fold less affinity than morphine.[A182300]    Tramadol exists as a racemic mixture consisting of two pharmacologically active enantiomers that both contribute to its analgesic property through different mechanisms: (+)-tramadol and its primary metabolite (+)-O-desmethyl-tramadol (M1) are agonists of the μ opioid receptor while (+)-tramadol inhibits serotonin reuptake and (-)-tramadol inhibits norepinephrine reuptake. These pathways are complementary and synergistic, improving tramadol's ability to modulate the perception of and response to pain.[A4269]     In animal models, M1 is up to 6 times more potent than tramadol in producing analgesia and 200 times more potent in μ-opioid binding.[L9257]     Tramadol has also been shown to affect a number of pain modulators including alpha2-adrenoreceptors, neurokinin 1 receptors, the voltage-gated sodium channel type II alpha subunit[A183728], transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1 - also known as the capsaicin receptor)[A183734], muscarinic receptors (M1 and M3), N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (also known as the NMDA receptor or glutamate receptor)[A17158], Adenosine A1 receptors[A183761], and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.[A17159]     In addition to the above neuronal targets, tramadol has a number of effects on inflammatory and immune mediators involved in the pain response. This includes inhibitory effects on cytokines, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), nuclear factor-κB, and glial cells as well as a change in the polarization state of M1 macrophages.[A182300]"
57,"For treatment of chickenpox - varicella, herpes zoster and herpes simplexA nucleoside antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces antibioticus. It has some antineoplastic properties and has broad spectrum activity against DNA viruses in cell cultures and significant antiviral activity against infections caused by a variety of viruses such as the herpes viruses, the vaccinia VIRUS and varicella zoster virus.Vidarabine is a synthetic purine nucleoside analogue with in vitro and in vivo inhibitory activity against herpes simplex virus types 1 (HSV-1), 2 (HSV-2), and varicella-zoster virus (VZV). The inhibitory activity of Vidarabine is highly selective due to its affinity for the enzyme thymidine kinase (TK) encoded by HSV and VZV. This viral enzyme converts Vidarabine into Vidarabine monophosphate, a nucleotide analogue. The monophosphate is further converted into diphosphate by cellular guanylate kinase and into triphosphate by a number of cellular enzymes. In vitro, Vidarabine triphosphate stops the DNA replication of herpes virus by being incorporated into the DNA strand and preventing the formation of phosphodiester bridges between bases. This ultimately leads to destabilization of the viral DNA strands. Vidarabine stops replication of herpes viral DNA in 2 ways: 1) competitive inhibition of viral DNA polymerase, and consequently 2) incorporation into and termination of the growing viral DNA chain.  Vidarabine is sequentially phosphorylated by kinases to the triphosphate ara-ATP, which is the active form of vidarabine that acts as both an inhibitor and a substrate of viral DNA polymerase. By acting as a substrate for viral DNA polymerase, ara-ATP competitively inhibits dATP leading to the formation of ‘faulty�?DNA. Ara-ATP can also be incorporated into the DNA strand to replace many of the adenosine bases, resulting in the disruption of DNA synthesis."
58,"Fluconazole can be administered in the treatment of the following fungal infections[L11043]:     1) Vaginal yeast infections caused by Candida   2) Systemic Candida infections   3) Both esophageal and oropharyngeal candidiasis    4) Cryptococcal meningitis   5) UTI (urinary tract infection) by Candida   6) Peritonitis (inflammation of the peritoneum) caused by Candida    **A note on fungal infection prophylaxis**    Patients receiving bone marrow transplantation who are treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy may be predisposed to candida infections, and may receive fluconazole as prophylactic therapy.[L11043]    **A note on laboratory testing**    Obtaining specimens for fungal culture and other important laboratory studies such as serology or pathology is advised before starting fluconazole therapy in order to isolate the organisms to be eliminated through treatment. It is permissible to start therapy before the results are available, however, adjusting the therapy once laboratory results confirm the causative organism may be necessary.[L11043]  Fluconazole, commonly known as _Diflucan_, is an antifungal drug used for the treatment of both systemic and superficial fungal infections in a variety of tissues.  It was initially approved by the FDA in 1990. This drug is an _azole_ antifungal, in the same drug family as [ketoconazole] and [itraconazole]. Fluconazole has many advantages over the other antifungal drugs including the option of oral administration. The side effect profile of this drug is minimal. It has been demonstrated as an efficacious treatment for vaginal yeast infections in one single dose.[A174325]Fluconazole has been demonstrated to show fungistatic activity against the majority of strains of the following microorganisms, curing fungal infections[L11043]:    _Candida albicans, Candida glabrata (Many strains are intermediately susceptible), Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, Cryptococcus neoformans_    This is achieved through steroidal inhibition in fungal cells, interfering with cell wall synthesis and growth as well as cell adhesion, thereby treating fungal infections and their symptoms.[L11043,A174325,A174343]    The fungistatic activity of fluconazole has also been shown in normal and immunocompromised animal models with both systemic and intracranial fungal infections caused by _Cryptococcus neoformans_ and for systemic infections caused by Candida albicans.[L11043]  It is important to note that resistant organisms have been found against various strains of organisms treated with fluconazole.[A178759,A178762,A178765] This further substantiates the need to perform susceptibility testing when fluconazole is considered as an antifungal therapy.[A178768,A178786]       **A note on steroidal effects of fluconazole**    There has been some concern that fluconazole may interfere with and inactivate human steroids/hormones due to the inhibition of hepatic cytochrome enzymes.[L11034]  Fluconazole has demonstrated to be more selective for _fungal_ cytochrome P-450 enzymes than for a variety of mammalian cytochrome P-450 enzymes. Fluconazole 50 mg administered daily for up to 28 days in individuals of reproductive age has been show to have no effect on testosterone plasma concentrations of males and plasma concentrations of steroids in females. A 200-400 mg dose of fluconazole showed no clinically relevant effect on steroid levels or on ACTH-stimulated steroid response in healthy males, in one clinical study mentioned on the European Medicines Agency label.[L11034] Other studies have shown no significant effects of fluconazole on steroid levels, further confirming these data.[A174358,A178780]Fluconazole is a very selective inhibitor of fungal cytochrome P450 dependent enzyme _lanosterol 14-α-demethylase_. This enzyme normally works to convert _lanosterol_ to _ergosterol_, which is necessary for fungal cell wall synthesis.  The free nitrogen atom located on the azole ring of fluconazole binds with a single iron atom located in the heme group of lanosterol 14-α-demethylase.[A178774] This prevents oxygen activation and, as a result, inhibits the demethylation of lanosterol, halting the process of ergosterol biosynthesis.[A178777]  Methylated sterols are then found to accumulate in the fungal cellular membrane, leading to an arrest of fungal growth.[A178774] These accumulated sterols negatively affect the structure and function of the fungal cell plasma membrane.[A16632]    Fluconazole resistance may arise from an alteration in the amount or function of the target enzyme (lanosterol 14-α-demethylase), altered access to this enzyme, or a combination of the above.[A16632] Other mechanisms may also be implicated, and studies are ongoing.[A178783]"
59,"For the treatment of Type II diabetes mellitus. It is used alone or in combination with a sulfonylurea, metformin, or insulin as an adjunct to diet and exercise.Troglitazone was withdrawn in 2000 due to risk of hepatotoxicity. It was superseded by [pioglitazone] and [rosiglitazone].Troglitazone is an oral antihyperglycemic agent which acts primarily by decreasing insulin resistance. Troglitazone is used in the management of type II diabetes (noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) also known as adult-onset diabetes). It improves sensitivity to insulin in muscle and adipose tissue and inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis. Troglitazone is not chemically or functionally related to either the sulfonylureas, the biguanides, or the g-glucosidase inhibitors. Troglitazone may be used concomitantly with a sulfonylurea or insulin to improve glycemic control.Troglitazone is a thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agent that lowers blood glucose by improving target cell response to insulin. It has a unique mechanism of action that is dependent on the presence of insulin for activity. Troglitazone decreases hepatic glucose output and increases insulin dependent glucose disposal in skeletal muscle. Its mechanism of action is thought to involve binding to nuclear receptors (PPAR) that regulate the transcription of a number of insulin responsive genes critical for the control of glucose and lipid metabolism. Troglitazone is a ligand to both PPARα and PPARγ, with a highter affinity for PPARγ. The drug also contains an α-tocopheroyl moiety, potentially giving it vitamin E-like activity. Troglitazone has been shown to reduce inflammation, and is associated with a decrase in nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) and a concomitant increase in its inhibitor (IκB). Unlike sulfonylureas, troglitazone is not an insulin secretagogue."
60,"According to FDA prescribing information, oseltamivir is indicated for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated illness due to influenza A and B infection in patients 2 weeks of age and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 48 hours [F3094]. In particular, this agent is indicated in adults and children including full-term neonates who present with symptoms typical of influenza when influenza virus is circulating in the community. Efficacy has been demonstrated when treatment is initiated within two days of the first onset of symptoms.[F3097]    Oseltamivir is also indicated for the prophylaxis of influenza in patients one year and older [F3094]. Specifically, post-exposure prevention in individuals one year of age or older following contact with a clinically diagnosed influenza case when influenza virus is circulating in the community qualifies for such prophylactic therapy. Oseltamivir would only be indicated for post-exposure prevention of influenza in infants less than 1 year of age during a pandemic influenza outbreak. [F3097]Oseltamivir (marketed as the product Tamiflu�?, is an antiviral neuraminidase inhibitor used for the treatment and prophylaxis of infection with influenza viruses A (including pandemic H1N1) and B. Oseltamivir exerts its antiviral activity by inhibiting the activity of the viral neuraminidase enzyme found on the surface of the virus, which prevents budding from the host cell, viral replication, and infectivity.    The clinical benefit of use of oseltamivir is greatest when administered within 48 hours of the onset of influenza symptoms since effectiveness decreases significantly after that point in time; there is generally no benefit in use beyond 48 hours for healthy, low-risk individuals as influenza is a self-limiting illness.[A180574, L7267, A180580] However, antiviral treatment might be beneficial when initiated after 48 hours for patients with severe, complicated or progressive illness or for hospitalized patients.[A180583] According to the CDC, data from clinical trials and observational studies have demonstrated that early antiviral treatment can shorten the duration of fever and illness symptoms, and may reduce the risk of some complications (including pneumonia and respiratory failure). They recommend the use of oseltamivir in people with a higher risk of developing complications including children younger than 2 years, people over 65 years, people with some chronic conditions or immunosuppression, pregnant women, residents of long term care facilities, and indigenous communities for example.[L7264]    The benefits of oseltamivir use are controversial; a 2014 Cochrane Review of the evidence found that oseltamivir treatment had limited benefit. The authors concluded that oseltamivir use in healthy adults had small, non-specific effects on symptoms (where the time to first alleviation of symptoms was only reduced from 7 to 6.3 days), it had no effect on hospitalizations, and that there was no evidence for any reductions in complications of influenza such as pneumonia.[A179962, A179965, A179968] Due to the risk of adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, psychiatric effects and renal adverse events in adults and vomiting in children, the harms are generally considered to outweigh the small clinical benefit of use of oseltamivir.     Notably, in 2017, the World Health Organization downgraded oseltamivir from its essential medicines list from a ""core"" drug to a ""complementary"" drug, due to limited cost-effectiveness.[A179086] Yearly vaccination with the influenza vaccine is still considered the best preventative measure.There have been postmarketing reports of delirium and abnormal behavior leading to injury, and in some cases resulting in fatal outcomes, in patients with influenza who were receiving oseltamivir. Because these events were reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made but they appear to be uncommon based on oseltamivir. These events were reported primarily among pediatric patients and often had an abrupt onset and rapid resolution. The contribution of oseltamivir to these events has not been established. Influenza can be associated with a variety of neurologic and behavioral symptoms that can include events such as hallucinations, delirium, and abnormal behavior, in some cases resulting in fatal outcomes. These events may occur in the setting of encephalitis or encephalopathy but can occur without obvious severe disease.[F3097, A180586, A180589]Oseltamivir phosphate is a pro-drug of the active metabolite (oseltamivir carboxylate) which is a potent and selective inhibitor of influenza virus neuraminidase enzymes, which are glycoproteins found on the virion surface. Viral neuraminidase enzyme activity is important for viral entry into uninfected cells, for the release of recently formed virus particles from infected cells, and for the further spread of the infectious virus in the body.[F3097, L5161, F3115] Oseltamivir activity reduces viral shedding and infectivity.    Oseltamivir is effective agaisnt viral neuraminidases of influenza A (including pandemic H1N1) and influenza B.[F3097, L5161, F3115] "
61,"  Erythromycin is indicated in the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of various bacteria.[L7261] The indications for erythromycin have been summarized by body system below:    **Respiratory infections**    Mild to moderate upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Haemophilus influenzae (when used concomitantly with appropriate doses of sulfonamides) can be treated with erythromycin.[L7261] Mild to moderate lower-respiratory tract infections due to susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Streptococcus pyogenes may also be treated. Erythromycin treats listeriosis caused by Listeria monocytogenes may also be treated with erythromycin.[L7261]  Erythromycin is indicated to treat pertussis (whooping cough) caused by Bordetella pertussis. It is effective in eliminating the causative organism from the nasopharynx of infected individuals, rendering them noninfectious. Clinical studies suggest that erythromycin may aid in the prevention of pertussis infection for individuals who have been exposed to the bacteria.[L7261] Respiratory tract infections due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae may also be treated with erythromycin.[L7261]  Despite the fact that no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted to this date, in vitro and certain preliminary clinical study results indicate that erythromycin may be an effective treatment in  Legionnaires�?Disease.[L7261] Finally, erythromycin is indicated to treat diphtheria and other infections due to Corynebacterium diphtheriae, as an adjunct to antitoxin, to prevent carrier status and to eradicate the organism in existing carriers.[L7261] In addition to the prevention of diphtheria, erythromycin can be used to prevent rheumatic fever in penicillin intolerant patients.[L7261]       **Skin infections**    Mild to moderate skin or skin structure infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus may be treated with erythromycin, however, resistant staphylococcal organisms may emerge.[L7261] Erythromycin can also be used to treat erythrasma, an infectious condition caused by Corynebacterium minutissimum.[L7261]      **Gastrointestinal infections**    Intestinal amebiasis caused by Entamoeba histolytica can be treated with oral erythromycin. Extraenteric amebiasis warrants treatment with other antimicrobial drugs.[L7261]      **Genital infections/STIs**    Erythromycin can be used as an alternative drug in treating acute pelvic inflammatory disease caused by N. gonorrheae in female patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity or intolerance to penicillin.[L7261] Syphilis, caused by Treponema pallidum, can be treated with erythromycin.  It serves as an alternative treatment for primary syphilis in patients who have demonstrated penicillin hypersensitivity. Erythromycin can also be used in the primary stage of primary syphilis.[L7261] Another approved indication of erythromycin is to treat chlamydial infections that cause conjunctivitis of the newborn, pneumonia of infancy, and urogenital infections occurring in pregnancy. It is indicated as an alternative option to tetracyclines for the treatment of uncomplicated rectal, urethral and endocervical infections in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis.[L7261] Erythromycin can be used in nongonococcal urethritis can be used when tetracyclines cannot be administered. Finally, erythromycin is indicated to treat nongonococcal urethritis due to Ureaplasma urealyticum.[L7261]  Erythromycin is a bacteriostatic antibiotic drug produced by a strain of Saccharopolyspora erythraea (formerly Streptomyces erythraeus) and belongs to the macrolide group of antibiotics which consists of [Azithromycin], [Clarithromycin], [Spiramycin] and others. It was originally discovered in 1952.[L5245] Erythromycin is widely used for treating a variety of infections, including those caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.[L5245,L7261] It is available for administration in various forms, including intravenous, topical, and eye drop preparations.[L5245]Macrolides, such as erythromycin, stop bacterial growth by inhibiting protein synthesis and translation, treating bacterial infections.[A174175] Erythromycin does not exert effects on nucleic acid synthesis.[L7261] This drug has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, effectively treating both in vitro and clinical infections. Despite this, it is important to perform bacterial susceptibility testing before administering this antibiotic, as resistance is a common issue that may affect treatment.[L7261]     **A note on antimicrobial resistance, pseudomembranous colitis, and hepatotoxicity**    Many strains of Haemophilus influenzae are resistant to erythromycin alone but are found to be susceptible to erythromycin and sulfonamides used in combination. It is important to note that Staphylococci that are resistant to erythromycin may emerge during erythromycin and/or sulfonamide therapy.[L7261] Pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with most antibacterial agents, including erythromycin, and may range in severity from mild to life-threatening. Therefore, the physician should consider this diagnosis in patients with diarrhea after the administration of antibacterial agents.[L7261] Erythromycin can cause hepatic dysfunction, cholestatic jaundice, and abnormal liver transaminases, particularly when erythromycin estolate is administered.[L7270]      In order to replicate, bacteria require a specific process of protein synthesis, enabled by ribosomal proteins.[A6505] Erythromycin acts by inhibition of protein synthesis by binding to the 23S ribosomal RNA molecule in the 50S subunit of ribosomes in susceptible bacterial organisms.  It stops bacterial protein synthesis by inhibiting the transpeptidation/translocation step of protein synthesis and by inhibiting the assembly of the 50S ribosomal subunit.[L7261,A14179] This results in the control of various bacterial infections.[A174193,L7261] The strong affinity of macrolides, including erythromycin, for bacterial ribosomes, supports their broad‐spectrum antibacterial activities.[A174193]    "
62,"For treatment of pernicious anemia and the prevention and treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency arising from alcoholism, malabsorption, tapeworm infestation, celiac, hyperthyroidism, hepatic-biliary tract disease, persistent diarrhea, ileal resection, pancreatic cancer, renal disease, prolonged stress, vegan diets, macrobiotic diets or other restrictive diets. Also for the treatment of known or suspected cyanide poisoning.Hydroxocobalamin, also known as vitamin B12a and hydroxycobalamin, is an injectable form of vitamin B 12 that has been used therapeutically to treat vitamin B 12 deficiency. It is also used in cyanide poisoning, Leber's optic atrophy, and toxic amblyopia.Hydroxocobalamin is a synthetic, injectable form of Vitamin B12. Hydroxocobalamin is actually a precursor of two cofactors or vitamins (Vitamin B12 and Methylcobalamin) which are involved in various biological systems in man. Vitamin B12 is required for the conversion of methylmalonate to succinate. Deficiency of this enzyme could therefore interfere with the production of lipoprotein in myelin sheath tissue and so give rise to neurological lesions. The second cofactor, Methylcobalamin, is necessary for the conversion of homocysteine to methionine which is essential for the metabolism of folic acid. Deficiency of tetrahydrafolate leads to reduced synthesis of thymidylate resulting in reduced synthesis of DNA which is essential for cell maturation. Vitamin B12 is also concerned in the maintenance of sulphydryl groups in reduced form, deficiency leading to decreased amounts of reduced SH content of erythrocytes and liver cells. Overall, vitamin B12 acts as a coenzyme for various metabolic functions, including fat and carbohydrate metabolism and protein synthesis. It is necessary for growth, cell replication, hematopoiesis, and nucleoprotein as well as myelin synthesis. This is largely due to its effects on metabolism of methionine folic acid, and malonic acid.Vitamin B12 exists in four major forms referred to collectively as cobalamins; deoxyadenosylcobalamin, methylcobalamin, hydroxocobalamin, and cyanocobalamin. Two of these, methylcobalamin and 5-deoxyadenosyl cobalamin, are primarily used by the body. Methionine synthase needs methylcobalamin as a cofactor. This enzyme is involved in the conversion of the amino acid homocysteine into methionine. Methionine in turn is required for DNA methylation. 5-Deoxyadenosyl cobalamin is a cofactor needed by the enzyme that converts L-methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. This conversion is an important step in the extraction of energy from proteins and fats. Furthermore, succinyl CoA is necessary for the production of hemoglobin, the substances that carries oxygen in red blood cells."
63,"Caffeine is indicated for the short term treatment of apnea of prematurity in infants and off label for the prevention and treatment of bronchopulmonary dysplasia caused by premature birth.[L9899] Caffeine has a broad range of over the counter uses, and is found in energy supplements, athletic enhancement products, pain relief products, as well as cosmetic products.[T716,L9854,L9872]Caffeine is a drug of the methylxanthine class used for a variety of purposes, including certain respiratory conditions of the premature newborn, pain relief, and to combat drowsiness. Caffeine is similar in chemical structure to [Theophylline] and [Theobromine].[A187691,L9851] It can be sourced from coffee beans, but also occurs naturally in various teas and cacao beans, which are different than coffee beans.[T716] Caffeine is also used in a variety of cosmetic products and can be administered topically, orally, by inhalation, or by injection.[T716]    The caffeine citrate injection, used for apnea of the premature newborn, was initially approved by the FDA in 1999.[L9863] According to an article from 2017, more than 15 million babies are born prematurely worldwide. This correlates to about 1 in 10 births. Premature birth can lead to apnea and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a condition that interferes with lung development and may eventually cause asthma or early onset emphysema in those born prematurely.[A187694] Caffeine is beneficial in preventing and treating apnea and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in newborns, improving the quality of life of premature infants.[T716]Caffeine stimulates the central nervous system (CNS), heightening alertness, and sometimes causing restlessness and agitation. It relaxes smooth muscle, stimulates the contraction of cardiac muscle, and enhances athletic performance.[A298,T716,L9857] Caffeine promotes gastric acid secretion and increases gastrointestinal motility. Finally, caffeine acts as a mild diuretic.[T716]The mechanism of action of caffeine is complex, as it impacts several body systems, which are listed below. The effects as they relate to various body systems are described as follows:    **General and cellular actions**    Caffeine exerts several actions on cells, but the clinical relevance is poorly understood. One probable mechanism is the inhibition of nucleotide phosphodiesterase enzymes, adenosine receptors, regulation of calcium handling in cells, and participates in adenosine receptor antagonism.[A187721,L9857] Phosphodiesterase enzymes regulate cell function via actions on second messengers cAMP and cGMP.[A187724] This causes lipolysis through activation of hormone-sensitive lipases, releasing fatty acids and glycerol.[T722]    **Respiratory**    The exact mechanism of action of caffeine in treating apnea related to prematurity is unknown, however, there are several proposed mechanisms, including respiratory center stimulation in the central nervous system, a reduced threshold to hypercapnia with increased response, and increased consumption of oxygen, among others.[L9851] The blocking of the adenosine receptors enhances respiratory drive via an increase in brain medullary response to carbon dioxide, stimulating ventilation and respiratory drive, while increasing contractility of the diaphragm.[T716]    **Central nervous system**    Caffeine demonstrates antagonism of all 4 adenosine receptor subtypes (A1, A2a, A2b, A3) in the central nervous system.[T716,L9851] Caffeine's effects on alertness and combatting drowsiness are specifically related to the antagonism of the A2a receptor.[T716]    **Renal system**    Caffeine has diuretic effects due to is stimulatory effects on renal blood flow, increase in glomerular filtration, and increase in sodium excretion.[T716]    **Cardiovascular system**    Adenosine receptor antagonism at the A1 receptor by caffeine stimulates inotropic effects in the heart. Blocking of adenosine receptors promotes catecholamine release, leading to stimulatory effects occurring in the heart and the rest of the body.  In the blood vessels, caffeine exerts direct antagonism of adenosine receptors, causing vasodilation. It stimulates the endothelial cells in the blood vessel wall to release nitric oxide, potentiating blood vessel relaxation. Catecholamine release, however, antagonizes this and exerts inotropic and chronotropic effects on the heart, ultimately leading to vasoconstriction. Finally, caffeine is shown to raise systolic blood pressure measurements by 5 to 10 mmHg when it is not taken regularly, versus no effect in those who consume it regularly.[T716] The vasoconstricting effects of caffeine are beneficial in migraines and other types of headache, which are normally caused by vasodilation in the brain.[A187709,L9872]"
64,"Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor that is predominantly employed for two primary indications:    (1) the treatment of erectile dysfunction [A175582, L5611, F3853, F3856, F3886]; and    (2) treatment of pulmonary hypertension, where:  a) the US FDA specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (WHO Group I) in adults to improve exercise ability and delay clinical worsening [F3850]. The delay in clinical worsening was demonstrated when sildenafil was added to background epoprostenol therapy [F3850]. Studies establishing effectiveness were short-term (12 to 16 weeks), and included predominately patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class II-III symptoms and idiopathic etiology (71%) or associated with connective tissue disease (CTD) (25%) [F3850];    b) the Canadian product monograph specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of primary pulmonary arterial hypertension (PPH) or pulmonary hypertension secondary to connective tissue disease (CTD) in adult patients with WHO functional class II or III who have not responded to conventional therapy [F3859]. In addition, improvement in exercise ability and delay in clinical worsening was demonstrated in adult patients who were already stabilized on background epoprostenol therapy [F3859]; and    c) the EMA product information specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension classified as WHO functional class II and III, to improve exercise capacity [F3883]. Efficacy has been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with connective tissue disease [F3883]. The EMA label also indicates sildenafil for the treatment of pediatric patients aged 1 year to 17 years old with pulmonary arterial hypertension [F3883]. Efficacy in terms of improvement of exercise capacity or pulmonary hemodynamics has been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital heart disease [F3883].In eliciting its mechanism of action, sildenafil ultimately prevents or minimizes the breakdown of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) by inhibiting cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The result of doing so allows cGMP present in both the penis and pulmonary vasculature to elicit smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation that subsequently facilitates relief in pulmonary arterial hypertension and the increased flow of blood into the spongy erectile tissue of the penis that consequently allows it to grow in size and become erect and rigid [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].    Interestingly enough, it is precisely via this mechanism why sildenafil was at first researched as a potential treatment for angina - or chest pain associated with inadequate blood flow to the heart - before being serendipitously indicated for treating erectile dysfunction in the late 1980s [A175732]. Nevertheless, it is because of this mechanism that sildenafil is also indicated for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension but is also additionally notorious for interacting with various anti-anginal or anti-hypertensive agents to develop potentially rapid, excessive, and/or fatal hypotensive crises [A175579, A175582, A175654].    Regardless, sildenafil, among a variety of other similar or related PDE5 inhibitors, has become a common and effective treatment for erectile dysfunction and since its formal approval for medical use in the public in 1998 [A175732], continues to see millions of prescriptions written for it internationally. Although the medication has historically been most popularly recognized as Pfizer's brand name Viagra, sildenafil is currently available generically and even as a non-prescription over the counter medication in some countries [L5656].In vitro studies have shown that sildenafil is selective for phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Its effect is more potent on PDE5 than on other known phosphodiesterases [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. In particular, there is a 10-times selectivity over PDE6 which is involved in the phototransduction pathway in the retina [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. There is an 80-times selectivity over PDE1, and over 700-times over PDE 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. And finally, sildenafil has greater than 4,000-times selectivity for PDE5 over PDE3, the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase isoform involved in the control of cardiac contractility [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].    In eight double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover studies of patients with either organic or psychogenic erectile dysfunction, sexual stimulation resulted in improved erections, as assessed by an objective measurement of hardness and duration of erections (via the use of RigiScan®), after sildenafil administration compared with placebo [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Most studies assessed the efficacy of sildenafil approximately 60 minutes post-dose [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The erectile response, as assessed by RigiScan®, generally increased with increasing sildenafil dose and plasma concentration [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The time course of effect was examined in one study, showing an effect for up to 4 hours but the response was diminished compared to 2 hours [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].    Sildenafil causes mild and transient decreases in systemic blood pressure which, in the majority of cases, do not translate into clinical effects [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. After chronic dosing of 80 mg, three times a day to patients with systemic hypertension the mean change from baseline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was a decrease of 9.4 mmHg and 9.1 mmHg respectively [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. After chronic dosing of 80 mg, three times a day to patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension lesser effects in blood pressure reduction were observed (a reduction in both systolic and diastolic pressure of 2 mmHg)[F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614] . At the recommended dose of 20 mg three times a day no reductions in systolic or diastolic pressure were seen [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].    Single oral doses of sildenafil up to 100 mg in healthy volunteers produced no clinically relevant effects on ECG [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. After chronic dosing of 80 mg three times a day to patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension no clinically relevant effects on the ECG were reported either [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].    In a study of the hemodynamic effects of a single oral 100 mg dose of sildenafil in 14 patients with severe coronary artery disease (CAD) (> 70 % stenosis of at least one coronary artery), the mean resting systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased by 7 % and 6 % respectively compared to baseline [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Mean pulmonary systolic blood pressure decreased by 9% [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Sildenafil showed no effect on cardiac output and did not impair blood flow through the stenosed coronary arteries [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].    Mild and transient differences in color discrimination (blue/green) were detected in some subjects using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test at 1 hour following a 100 mg dose, with no effects evident after 2 hours post-dose [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The postulated mechanism for this change in color discrimination is related to inhibition of PDE6, which is involved in the phototransduction cascade of the retina [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Sildenafil has no effect on visual acuity or contrast sensitivity. In a small size placebo-controlled study of patients with documented early age-related macular degeneration (n = 9), sildenafil (single dose, 100 mg) demonstrated no significant changes in visual tests conducted (which included visual acuity, Amsler grid, color discrimination simulated traffic light, and the Humphrey perimeter and photostress test) [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].Sildenafil is an oral therapy for erectile dysfunction [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. In the natural setting, i.e. with sexual stimulation, it restores impaired erectile function by increasing blood flow to the penis [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611].    The physiological mechanism responsible for the erection of the penis involves the release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum during sexual stimulation [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Nitric oxide then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), producing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allowing inflow of blood [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611].    Sildenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) in the corpus cavernosum, where PDE5 is responsible for degradation of cGMP [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Sildenafil has a peripheral site of action on erections [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum but potently enhances the relaxant effect of NO on this tissue [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. When the NO/cGMP pathway is activated, as occurs with sexual stimulation, inhibition of PDE5 by sildenafil results in increased corpus cavernosum levels of cGMP [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Therefore sexual stimulation is required in order for sildenafil to produce its intended beneficial pharmacological effects [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611].    Moreover, apart from the presence of PDE5 in the corpus cavernosum of the penis, PDE5 is also present in the pulmonary vasculature [A175579, F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614]. Sildenafil, therefore, increases cGMP within pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells resulting in relaxation [A175579, F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614]. In patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, this can lead to vasodilation of the pulmonary vascular bed and, to a lesser degree, vasodilatation in the systemic circulation [A175579, F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614]."
65,"For the maintenance of normal sinus rhythm (delay in time to recurrence of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter [AF/AFl]) in patients with atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter of greater than one week duration who have been converted to normal sinus rhythmDofetilide is a class III antiarrhythmic agent that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the maintenance of sinus rhythm in individuals prone to the formation of atrial fibrillation and flutter, and for the chemical cardioversion to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation and flutter.Dofetilide is an antiarrhythmic drug with Class III (cardiac action potential duration prolonging) properties and is indicated for the maintenance of normal sinus rhythm. Dofetilide increases the monophasic action potential duration in a predictable, concentration-dependent manner, primarily due to delayed repolarization. At concentrations covering several orders of magnitude, Dofetilide blocks only IKr with no relevant block of the other repolarizing potassium currents (e.g., IKs, IK1). At clinically relevant concentrations, Dofetilide has no effect on sodium channels (associated with Class I effect), adrenergic alpha-receptors, or adrenergic beta-receptors.The mechanism of action of Dofetilide is a blockade of the cardiac ion channel carrying the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current, IKr. This inhibition of potassium channels results in a prolongation of action potential duration and the effective refractory period of accessory pathways (both anterograde and retrograde conduction in the accessory pathway)."
66,"For the treatment of toxoplasmosis and acute malaria; For the prevention of malaria in areas non-resistant to pyrimethamineOne of the folic acid antagonists that is used as an antimalarial or with a sulfonamide to treat toxoplasmosis.Pyrimethamine is an antiparasitic compound commonly used as an adjunct in the treatment of uncomplicated, chloroquine resistant, P. falciparum malaria. Pyrimethamine is a folic acid antagonist and the rationale for its therapeutic action is based on the differential requirement between host and parasite for nucleic acid precursors involved in growth. This activity is highly selective against plasmodia and Toxoplasma gondii. Pyrimethamine possesses blood schizonticidal and some tissue schizonticidal activity against malaria parasites of humans. However, the 4-amino-quinoline compounds are more effective against the erythrocytic schizonts. It does not destroy gametocytes, but arrests sporogony in the mosquito. The action of pyrimethamine against Toxoplasma gondii is greatly enhanced when used in conjunction with sulfonamides.Pyrimethamine inhibits the dihydrofolate reductase of plasmodia and thereby blocks the biosynthesis of purines and pyrimidines, which are essential for DNA synthesis and cell multiplication. This leads to failure of nuclear division at the time of schizont formation in erythrocytes and liver."
67,"For the treatment of hypertensionAn alkaloid found in the roots of Rauwolfia serpentina and R. vomitoria. Reserpine inhibits the uptake of norepinephrine into storage vesicles resulting in depletion of catecholamines and serotonin from central and peripheral axon terminals. It has been used as an antihypertensive and an antipsychotic as well as a research tool, but its adverse effects limit its clinical use.    The FDA withdrew its approval for the use of all oral dosage form drug products containing more than 1 mg of reserpine.[L43942]Reserpine is an adrenergic blocking agent used to treat mild to moderate hypertension via the disruption of norepinephrine vesicular storage. The antihypertensive actions of Reserpine are a result of its ability to deplete catecholamines from peripheral sympathetic nerve endings. These substances are normally involved in controlling heart rate, force of cardiac contraction and peripheral resistance.Reserpine's mechanism of action is through inhibition of the ATP/Mg2+ pump responsible for the sequestering of neurotransmitters into storage vesicles located in the presynaptic neuron. The neurotransmitters that are not sequestered in the storage vesicle are readily metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO) causing a reduction in catecholamines."
68,"Used in patients, who have had a stroke or stroke precursors and who cannot take aspirin or aspirin has not worked, to try to prevent another thrombotic stroke.  Ticlopidine is an effective inhibitor of platelet aggregation. It is a prodrug that is metabolised to an active form, which blocks the ADP receptor that is involved in GPIIb/IIIa receptor activation leading to platelet aggregation. Ticlopidine is marketed under the brand name Ticlid and is indicated for patients who cannot take aspirin or in whom aspirin has not worked to prevent a thrombotic stroke. The FDA label includes a black-box warning of neutropenia, aplastic anemia, thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura, and agranulocytosis, so it is necessary to monitor patients' WBC and platelets when they are taking ticlopidine.Ticlopidine is a prodrug that is metabolised to an as yet undetermined metabolite that acts as a platelet aggregation inhibitor. Inhibition of platelet aggregation causes a prolongation of bleeding time. In its prodrug form, ticlopidine has no significant in vitro activity at the concentrations attained in vivo.The active metabolite of ticlopidine prevents binding of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to its platelet receptor, impairing the ADP-mediated activation of the glycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa complex. It is proposed that the inhibition involves a defect in the mobilization from the storage sites of the platelet granules to the outer membrane. No direct interference occurs with the GPIIb/IIIa receptor. As the glycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa complex is the major receptor for fibrinogen, its impaired activation prevents fibrinogen binding to platelets and inhibits platelet aggregation. By blocking the amplification of platelet activation by released ADP, platelet aggregation induced by agonists other than ADP is also inhibited by the active metabolite of ticlopidine."
69,"For the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency, detrusor instability and frequency of micturition.Trospium is an antispasmodic agent used to treat the symptoms of overactive bladder, a condition that causes the bladder muscles to contract uncontrollably.[L6208] An overactive bladder leads to an increased urge to urinate, frequent urination, and sometimes, loss of control over urination.[L6208]  Trospium is manufactured by _Indevus Pharmaceutical Inc._ and was granted FDA approval in 2007.[L6211]Trospium is an antispasmodic, antimuscarinic agent indicated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency. According to receptor assays, it displays higher affinity towards muscarininc receptors compared to nicotinic receptors at therapeutic concentrations. Trospium antagonizes the effect of acetylcholine on muscarinic receptors in cholinergically innervated organs. Its parasympatholytic action reduces the tonus of smooth muscle in the bladder."
70,"For the treatment of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension (OH).An ethanolamine derivative that is an adrenergic alpha agonist. It is used as a vasoconstrictor agent in the treatment of hypotension.Midodrine is a prodrug, i.e., the therapeutic effect of orally administered midodrine is due to the major metabolite desglymidodrine formed by deglycination of midodrine. Administration of midodrine results in a rise in standing, sitting, and supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients with orthostatic hypotension of various etiologies. Standing systolic blood pressure is elevated by approximately 15 to 30 mmHg at 1 hour after a 10-mg dose of midodrine, with some effect persisting for 2 to 3 hours. Midodrine has no clinically significant effect on standing or supine pulse rates in patients with autonomic failure.Midodrine undergoes metabolism to form its pharmacologically active metabolite, desglymidodrine. Desglymidodrine acts as an agonist at the alpha1-adrenergic receptors expressed in the arteriolar and venous vasculature. Activation of alpha1-adrenergic receptor signaling pathways lead to an increase in the vascular tone and elevation of blood pressure. Desglymidodrine is reported to have negligible effect on the cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors."
71,"**Pantoprazole Injection**:    **Treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease associated with a history of erosive esophagitis**    Pantoprazole for injection is indicated for short-term treatment (7-10 days) of patients having gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with a history of erosive esophagitis, as an alternative to oral medication in patients who are unable to continue taking pantoprazole delayed-release tablets. _Safety and efficacy of pantoprazole injection as the initial treatment of patients having GERD with a history of erosive esophagitis have not been demonstrated at this time_.[FDA label]    **Pathological Hypersecretion Associated with Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome**    Pantoprazole for injection is indicated for the treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions associated with Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome or other neoplastic conditions.[FDA label]    **Pantoprazole delayed-release oral suspension**:    **Short-Term Treatment of erosive esophagitis associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)**    Indicated in adults and pediatric patients five years of age and above for the short-term treatment (up to 8 weeks) in the healing and symptomatic relief of erosive esophagitis. For adult patients who have not healed after 8 weeks of treatment, an additional 8-week course of pantoprazole may be considered. Safety of treatment beyond 8 weeks in pediatric patients has not been determined.[F3202]    **Maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis**    Indicated for maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis and reduction in relapse rates of daytime and nighttime heartburn symptoms in adult patients with GERD.[F3202]    **Pathological hypersecretory conditions including Zollinger-Ellison syndrome**    Indicated for the long-term treatment of the above conditions.[F3202]Pantoprazole is a first-generation proton pump inhibitor (PPI) used for the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), for gastric protection to prevent recurrence of stomach ulcers or gastric damage from chronic use of NSAIDs, and for the treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions including Zollinger-Ellison (ZE) Syndrome.[A177271][F4498] Its efficacy is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including [omeprazole], [esomeprazole], [lansoprazole], [dexlansoprazole], and [rabeprazole].    Pantoprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cell. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. As the binding of pantoprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, pantoprazole's duration of antisecretory effect persists longer than 24 hours.[FDA Label]    Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as pantoprazole have been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]    PPIs such as pantoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]    Pantoprazole doses should be slowly lowered, or tapered, before discontinuing as rapid discontinuation of PPIs such as pantoprazole may cause a rebound effect and a short term increase in hypersecretion.[A177574]This drug acts to decrease gastric acid secretion, which reduces stomach acidity. Pantoprazole administration leads to long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion.[F3193]    **General Effects**    Pantoprazole has been shown to reduce acid reflux-related symptoms, heal inflammation of the esophagus, and improve patient quality of life more effectively than histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2 blockers). This drug has an excellent safety profile and a low incidence of drug interactions. It can be used safely in various high-risk patient populations, including the elderly and those with renal failure or moderate hepatic dysfunction.[A174226]    Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as pantoprazole have been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]    PPIs such as pantoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes [A177577, A177580].     **A note on laboratory testing abnormalities**    During treatment with antisecretory medicinal products such as pantoprazole, serum gastrin (a peptide hormone that stimulates secretion of gastric acid) increases in response to the decreased acid secretion caused by proton pump inhibition. The increased gastrin level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Published evidence suggests that proton pump inhibitors should be stopped 14 days before chromogranin A (CgA) measurements. This permits chromogranin A levels, that might be falsely elevated after proton pump inhibitor treatment, to return to the normal reference range.[F3217]     Reports have been made of false-positive results in urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving the majority of proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole. A confirmatory method should be used.[F3217]Hydrochloric acid (HCl) secretion into the gastric lumen is a process regulated mainly by the H(+)/K(+)-ATPase of the proton pump, expressed in high quantities by the parietal cells of the stomach.[A174295] ATPase is an enzyme on the parietal cell membrane that facilitates hydrogen and potassium exchange through the cell, which normally results in the extrusion of potassium and formation of HCl (gastric acid).     Proton pump inhibitors such as pantoprazole are substituted _benzimidazole_ derivatives, weak bases, which accumulate in the acidic space of the parietal cell before being converted in the _canaliculi_  (small canal) of the gastric parietal cell, an acidic environment, to active _sulfenamide_ derivatives. This active form then makes disulfide bonds with important cysteines on the gastric acid pump, inhibiting its function.[A174247] Specifically, pantoprazole binds to the _sulfhydryl group_ of H+, K+-ATPase, which is an enzyme implicated in accelerating the final step in the acid secretion pathway. The enzyme is inactivated, inhibiting gastric acid secretion.[A174253] The inhibition of gastric acid secretion is stronger with proton pump inhibitors such as pantoprazole and lasts longer than with the H(2) antagonists.[A174295] "
72,"Torasemide is indicated for the treatment of edema associated with congestive heart failure, renal or hepatic diseases. From this condition, it has been observed that torasemide is very effective in cases of kidney failure.[FDA label]    As well, torasemide is approved to be used as an antihypertensive agent either alone or in combination with other antihypertensives.[FDA label]Torasemide is a high-ceiling loop diuretic.[A174463] Structurally, it is a pyridine-sulfonylurea used as an antihypertensive agent.[A319] Torasemide was first approved for clinical use by the FDA in 1993.[L5257]It is widely known that administration of torasemide can attenuate renal injury and reduce the severity of acute renal failure. This effect is obtained by increasing urine output and hence, facilitating fluid, acid-base and potassium control.[A174466] This effect is obtained by the increase in the excretion of urinary sodium and chloride.[A174472]    Several reports have indicated that torasemide presents a long-lasting diuresis and less potassium excretion which can be explained by the effect that torasemide has on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. This effect is very similar to the effect observed with the administration of combination therapy with [furosemide] and [spironolactone] and it is characterized by a decrease in plasma brain natriuretic peptide and improved measurements of left ventricular function.[A174472]     Above the aforementioned effect, torasemide presents a dual effect .in which the inhibition of aldosterone which donates torasemide with a potassium-sparing action.[A174466]    Torasemide has been shown to reduce extracellular fluid volume and blood pressure in hypertensive patients suffering from chronic kidney disease. As well, some reports have indicated that torasemide can reduce myocardial fibrosis by reducing the collagen accumulation. This effect is suggested to be related to the decrease in aldosterone which in order has been shown to reduce the production of the enzyme procollagen type I carboxy-terminal proteinase which is known to be overexpressed in heart failure patients.[A174463]As mentioned above, torasemide is part of the loop diuretics and thus, it acts by reducing the oxygen demand in the medullary thick ascending loop of Henle by inhibiting the Na+/K+/Cl- pump on the luminal cell membrane surface.[A174466] This action is obtained by the binding of torasemide to a chloride ion-binding site of the transport molecule.[L5257]    Torasemide is known to have an effect in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by inhibiting the downstream cascade after the activation of angiotensin II. This inhibition will produce a secondary effect marked by the reduction of the expression of aldosterone synthase, TGF-B1 and thromboxane A2 and a reduction on the aldosterone receptor binding.[A174466, A174472]"
73,"Citalopram is approved by the FDA for treating adults with major depressive disorder.[L47941] It has also been used off-label to treat various diseases, including but not limited to sexual dysfunction, ethanol abuse, psychiatric conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and diabetic neuropathy.[L5224,A321,A322,A261296] Citalopram is an antidepressant belonging to the class of selective _serotonin-reuptake inhibitors_ (SSRIs) widely used to treat the symptoms of depression. It is a racemic bicyclic phthalate derivate and is the only compound with a tertiary amine and 2 nitrogen-containing metabolites among all SSRIs.[A261316,A14720] Citalopram enhances serotonergic transmission through the inhibition of serotonin reuptake, and among all the SSRIs, citalopram appears to be the most selective toward serotonin reuptake inhibition.[A261316,A14720] Specifically, it has a very minimal effect on dopamine and norepinephrine transportation and virtually no affinity for muscarinic, histaminergic, or GABAergic receptors.[A261316]    Citalopram was approved by the FDA in 1998 for the treatment of depression in adults 18 years or older.[L5230]Citalopram belongs to a class of antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). It has been found to relieve or manage symptoms of depression, anxiety, eating disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder among other mood disorders. The antidepressant, anti-anxiety, and other actions of citalopram are linked to its inhibition of CNS central uptake of serotonin.[L47941] Serotonergic abnormalities have been reported in patients with mood disorders. Behavioral and neuropsychological effects of serotonin include the regulation of mood, perception, reward, anger, aggression, appetite, memory, sexuality, and attention, as examples. The onset of action for depression is approximately 1 to 4 weeks. The complete response may take 8-12 weeks after initiation of citalopram.[L5224]     In vitro studies demonstrate that citalopram is a strong and selective inhibitor of neuronal serotonin reuptake and has weak effects on norepinephrine and dopamine central reuptake. The chronic administration of citalopram has been shown to downregulate central norepinephrine receptors, similar to other drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder. Citalopram does not inhibit monoamine oxidase.[A325]The mechanism of action of citalopram is unclear but is presumed to be related to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT), potentially through the inhibition of the serotonin transporter (solute carrier family 6 member 4, _SLC6A4_).[L47941,A37688]     Citalopram binds with significantly less affinity to histamine, acetylcholine, and norepinephrine receptors than tricyclic antidepressant drugs. Particularly, citalopram has no or very low affinity for 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, dopamine D1and D2, α1, α2-, and β-adrenergic, histamine H1, gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), muscarinic cholinergic, and benzodiazepine receptors.[L47941]"
74,"For the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults.Eletriptan is a second generation triptan drug developed by Pfizer Inc for the treatment of migraine headaches.Eletriptan is a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine 1B/1D receptor agonist. In the anesthetized dog, eletriptan has been shown to reduce carotid arterial blood flow, with only a small increase in arterial blood pressure at high doses. While the effect on blood flow was selective for the carotid arterial bed, decreases in coronary artery diameter were observed. Eletriptan has also been shown to inhibit trigeminal nerve activity in the rat.Eletriptan binds with high affinity to 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D and 5-HT1F receptors, has modest affinity for 5-HT1A, 5-HT1E, 5-HT2B and 5-HT7 receptors, and little or no affinity for 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3, 5-HT4, 5-HT5A and 5-HT6 receptors. In contrast, eletriptan displays insignificant pharmacological activity at adrenergic alpha1, alpha2, or beta; dopaminergic D1 or D2; muscarinic; or opioid receptors. While the full mechanism of action of 5-HT receptor agonists in relieving migrains is not fully elucidated, it is proposed that the activation of 5-HT1 receptors located on intracranial blood vessels leads to vasoconstriction that correlates with the relief of migraine headaches. It is also proposed that the activation of 5-HT1 receptors on sensory nerve endings in the trigeminal system leads to the inhibition of release of pro-inflammatory neuropeptides. "
75,"For the treatment of hypertension.A guanidinium antihypertensive agent that acts by blocking adrenergic transmission.Bethanidine is a guanidinium antihypertensive agent that acts by blocking adrenergic transmission. The precise mode of action is not clear. Although bethanidine may produce adverse effects, they are beneficial in severe hypertension and produce fewer side effects than guanethidine.Bethanidine, a guanidine derivative, is a peripherally acting antiadrenergic agent which primarily acts as an alpha2a adrenergic agonist. Bethanidine effectively decreases blood pressure by suppressing renin secretion or interfering with function of the sympathetic nervous system."
76,"For the treatment of sinus and lung infections such as sinusitis, pneumonia, and secondary infections in chronic bronchitis. Also for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis (pinkeye).Moxifloxacin is a synthetic fluoroquinolone antibiotic agent. Bayer AG developed the drug (initially called BAY 12-8039) and it is marketed worldwide (as the hydrochloride) under the brand name Avelox (in some countries also Avalox) for oral treatment.Moxifloxacin is a quinolone/fluoroquinolone antibiotic. Moxifloxacin can be used to treat infections caused by the following bacteria: Aerobic Gram-positive microorganisms: _Corynebacterium_ species, _Micrococcus luteus_, _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Staphylococcus epidermidis_, _Staphylococcus haemolyticus_, _Staphylococcus hominis_, _Staphylococcus warneri_, _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, and _Streptococcus viridans_ group. Aerobic Gram-negative microorganisms: _Acinetobacter lwoffii_, _Haemophilus influenzae_, and _Haemophilus parainfluenzae_. Other microorganisms: _Chlamydia trachomatis_. Moxifloxacin is bactericidal and its mode of action depends on blocking of bacterial DNA replication by binding itself to an enzyme called DNA gyrase, which allows the untwisting required to replicate one DNA double helix into two. Notably the drug has 100 times higher affinity for bacterial DNA gyrase than for mammalian. Moxifloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.The bactericidal action of moxifloxacin results from inhibition of the enzymes topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV. DNA gyrase is an essential enzyme that is involved in the replication, transcription and repair of bacterial DNA. Topoisomerase IV is an enzyme known to play a key role in the partitioning of the chromosomal DNA during bacterial cell division."
77,"[L36485]Nelfinavir is a potent HIV-1 protease inhibitor. It is used in combination with other antiviral drugs in the treatment of HIV in both adults and children. Nelfinavir inhibits the HIV viral proteinase enzyme which prevents cleavage of the gag-pol polyprotein, resulting in noninfectious, immature viral particles.[L36485]Nelfinavir is a protease inhibitor with activity against Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1). Protease inhibitors block the part of HIV called protease. HIV-1 protease is an enzyme required for the proteolytic cleavage of the viral polyprotein precursors into the individual functional proteins found in infectious HIV-1. Nelfinavir binds to the protease active site and inhibits the activity of the enzyme. This inhibition prevents cleavage of the viral polyproteins resulting in the formation of immature non-infectious viral particles. Protease inhibitors are almost always used in combination with at least two other anti-HIV drugs.HIV viral protease is an important enzyme for HIV maturation and pathogenicity since HIV produces its structural and key proteins in the form of a polyprotein that needs to be cleaved by a protease.[A246853] HIV protease is synthesized as part of the Gag-pol polyprotein, where Gag encodes for the capsid and matrix protein to form the outer protein shell, and Pol encodes for the reverse transcriptase and integrase protein to synthesize and incorporate its genome into host cells.[A246853, A246858] The Gag-pol polyprotein undergoes proteolytic cleavage by HIV protease to produce 66 molecular species which will assume conformational changes to become fully active.[A246853] Inhibition of protease, therefore, prevents HIV virion from fully maturing and becoming infective.[A246853]    Nelfinavir is a competitive inhibitor of the HIV protease by reversibly binding to the active site of the enzyme, preventing it from interacting with its substrate to produce mature and infectious viral particles.[L36485, L41608]    "
78,"For the treatment of asthma, wheezing, and chronic asthmatic bronchitis.Isoetharine is a relatively selective beta-2 adrenergic agonist. It is a catechol-like agent. Isoetharine is a fast-acting bronchodilator used for emphysema, bronchitis and asthma.[A330]Isoetharine is a beta-adrenergic receptor agonist. While it is reported to demonstrate more selectivity towards beta-2 adrenergic receptors,[A259681] isoetharine still binds to beta-1 adrenergic receptors and thus may be associated with beta-1-mediated adverse events.[A330, A259686] Isoetharine produces maximal bronchodilation within 15 minutes of inhalation.[A330]Isoetharine-induced bronchodilator occurs from an increased activity of adenyl cyclase, which augments the formation of cyclic AMP (cAMP). Increased levels of cAMP result in the relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle, stimulation of ciliary activity, and potential improvement in capillary integrity.[A259681]"
79,"Glimepiride is indicated for the management of type 2 diabetes in adults as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control as monotherapy.     It may also be indicated for use in combination with metformin or insulin to lower blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes whose high blood sugar levels cannot be controlled by diet and exercise in conjunction with an oral hypoglycemic (a drug used to lower blood sugar levels) agent alone.[L10322]First introduced in 1995, glimepiride is a member of the second-generation sulfonylurea (SU) drug class used for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to improve glycemic control. Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder with increasing prevalences worldwide; it is characterized by insulin resistance in accordance with progressive β cell failure and long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications that lead to co-morbidities and mortalities. Sulfonylureas are one of the insulin secretagogues widely used for the management of type 2 diabetes to lower blood glucose levels. The main effect of SUs is thought to be effective when residual pancreatic β-cells are present,[A177715] as they work by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreatic beta cells and they are also thought to exert extra-pancreatic effects, such as increasing the insulin-mediated peripheral glucose uptake.[A177709]     Glimepiride works by stimulating the secretion of insulin granules from pancreatic islet beta cells by blocking ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K<SUB>ATP</SUB> channels) and causing depolarization of the beta cells. Compared to [glipizide], another second SU drug, glimepiride has a longer duration of action. It is sometimes classified as a third-generation SU because it has larger substitutions than other second-generation SUs.[A177703] Compared to other SUs, glimepiride was associated with a lower risk of developing hypoglycemia and weight gain in clinical trials [A177709] as well as fewer cardiovascular effects than other SUs due to minimal effects on ischemic preconditioning of cardiac myocytes.[A177703] It is effective in reducing fasting plasma glucose, postprandial glucose, and glycosylated hemoglobin levels and is considered to be a useful, cost-effective treatment option for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus.[A177703] Glimepiride was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States in 1995 for the treatment of T2DM. It is commonly marketed under the brand name Amaryl as oral tablets and is typically administered once daily.Glimepiride stimulates the secretion of insulin granules from the pancreatic beta cells and improves the sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin to increase peripheral glucose uptake, thus reducing plasma blood glucose levels and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels. A multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluated the efficacy of glimepiride (1�? mg) as monotherapy titrated over 10 weeks compared with placebo in T2DM subjects who were not controlled by diet alone.[A177703] In this study, there was a reduction in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) by 46 mg/dL, post-prandial glucose (PPG) by 72 mg/dL, and HbA1c by 1.4% more than the placebo.[A177703] In another randomized study comprising of patients with T2DM receiving either placebo or one of the three doses (1, 4, or 8 mg) of glimepiride during a 14-week study period, all glimepiride regimens significantly reduced FPG, PPG, and HbA1c values (P < 0.001) compared to placebo by the end of the study period.[A177703] The 4- and 8-mg doses of glimepiride were more effective than the 1-mg dose; however, the 4-mg dose provided a nearly maximal antihyperglycemic effect.[A177703]ATP-sensitive potassium channels on pancreatic beta cells that are gated by intracellular ATP and ADP. The hetero-octomeric complex of the channel is composed of four pore-forming Kir6.2 subunits and four regulatory sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) subunits. Alternative splicing allows the formation of channels composed of varying subunit isoforms expressed at different concentrations in different tissues.[A177730] In pancreatic beta cells, ATP-sensitive potassium channels play a role as essential metabolic sensors and regulators that couple membrane excitability with glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS).[A177727] When there is a decrease in the ATP:ADP ratio, the channels are activated and open, leading to K+ efflux from the cell, membrane hyperpolarization, and suppression of insulin secretion.[A177727] In contrast, increased uptake of glucose into the cell leads to elevated intracellular ATP:ADP ratio, leading to the closure of channels and membrane depolarization. Depolarization leads to activation and opening of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and consequently an influx of calcium ions into the cell.[A177727] Elevated intracellular calcium levels causes the contraction of the filaments of actomyosin responsible for the exocytosis of insulin granules stored in vesicles.[A177715] Glimepiride blocks the ATP-sensitive potassium channel by binding non-specifically to the B sites of both sulfonylurea receptor-1 (SUR1) and sulfonylurea receptor-2A (SUR2A) subunits as well as the A site of SUR1 subunit of the channel to promote insulin secretion from the beta cell.[A177715] "
80,"For relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid responsive dermatoses.Diflorasone is a topical corticosteroid used to treat itching and inflammation of the skin.Like other topical corticosteroids, diflorasone has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Diflorasone is a potent topical corticosteroid that should not be used with occlusive dressings. It is recommended that treatment should be limited to 2 consecutive weeks and therapy should be discontinued when adequate results have been achieved.The precise mechanism of the antiinflammatory activity of topical steroids in the treatment of steroid-responsive dermatoses, in general, is uncertain. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2."
81,"Lovastatin is indicated to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and the need for coronary revascularization procedures in individuals without symptomatic cardiovascular disease, average to moderately elevated total-C and LDL-C, and below average HDL-C. It is indicated as an intervention alternative in individuals presenting dyslipidemia at risk of developing atherosclerotic vascular disease. The administration of this agent should be accompanied by the implementation of a fat and cholesterol-restricted diet.[F4661]    Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be a component of multiple risk factor intervention in those individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia. Lovastatin is indicated as an adjunct to diet for the reduction of elevated total-C and LDL-C levels in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (Types IIa and IIb2), when the response to diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and to other nonpharmacological measures alone has been inadequate.[F4661,F4664]    Lovastatin is also indicated to slow the progression of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with coronary heart disease as part of a treatment strategy to lower total-C and LDL-C to target levels.[F4661]    Lovastatin is indicated as an adjunct to diet to reduce total-C, LDL-C and apolipoprotein B levels in adolescent boys and girls with Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) who are at least one year post-menarche, 10 to 17 years of age, with HeFH if after an adequate trial of diet therapy the following findings are present: LDL-C remains greater than 189 mg/dL or LDL-C remains greater than 160 mg/dL and there is a positive family history of premature cardiovascular disease or two or more other CVD risk factors are present in the adolescent patient.    Before administering lovastatin, it is important to rule out the presence of secondary causes of hypercholesterolemia and a lipid profile should be performed.    Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD. Statin-indicated conditions include diabetes mellitus, clinical atherosclerosis (including myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stable angina, documented coronary artery disease, stroke, trans ischemic attack (TIA), documented carotid disease, peripheral artery disease, and claudication), abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and severely elevated LDL-C levels.[A181087, A181406]Lovastatin, also known as the brand name product Mevacor, is a lipid-lowering drug and fungal metabolite derived synthetically from a fermentation product of _Aspergillus terreus_.[A174550] Originally named Mevinolin, lovastatin belongs to the statin class of medications, which are used to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and manage abnormal lipid levels by inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver.[A174553] More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as ""bad cholesterol""), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]    Lovastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [simvastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] Increasing use of the statin class of drugs is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]    While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, [rosuvastatin] is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg [rosuvastatin] per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decrease in LDL cholesterol levels, while lovastatin has been found to have an average decrease in LDL-C of 25-40%.[A174580,A181409,A181535,A181538,A1793] Potency is thought to correlate to tissue permeability as the more lipophilic statins such as lovastatin are thought to enter endothelial cells by passive diffusion, as opposed to hydrophilic statins such as [pravastatin] and [rosuvastatin] which are taken up into hepatocytes through OATP1B1 (organic anion transporter protein 1B1)-mediated transport.[A181424,A181460] Despite these differences in potency, several trials have demonstrated only minimal differences in terms of clinical outcomes between statins.[A181538, A181427]Lovastatin is an oral antilipemic agent which reversibly inhibits HMG-CoA reductase. It is used to lower total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apoB), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and trigleride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease and high ratios are associated with higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, lovastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[A174580,A181087,A181406,A181925]    Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A174580,A181397,A181403] Clinical studies have shown that lovastatin reduces LDL-C and total cholesterol by 25-40%.[A174580] The 50% inhibitory dose is known to be of 46 mcg/kg which is translated into a reduction of approximately 30% of plasma cholesterol.[A174553]    **Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis**    Lovastatin, like other inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, occasionally causes myopathy manifested as muscle pain, tenderness or weakness with creatine kinase (CK) above ten times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Myopathy sometimes takes the form of rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria, and rare fatalities have occurred. The risk of myopathy is dose-related and is increased by high levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity in plasma. In a clinical study (EXCEL)[A181925] in which patients were carefully monitored and some interacting drugs were excluded, there was one case of myopathy among 4933 patients randomized to lovastatin 20 to 40 mg daily for 48 weeks, and 4 among 1649 patients randomized to 80 mg daily.    Predisposing factors for myopathy include advanced age (�?5 years), female gender, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and renal impairment. Chinese patients may also be at increased risk for myopathy. In most cases, muscle symptoms and CK increases resolved when treatment was promptly discontinued. Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors coadministered with [colchicine], and caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing these two medications together.[F4661,F4664]    Real-world data from observational studies has suggested that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.[A182258]    **Liver Dysfunction**    Persistent increases (to more than 3 times the upper limit of normal) in serum transaminases occurred in 1.9% of adult patients who received lovastatin for at least one year in early clinical trials. When the drug was interrupted or discontinued in these patients, the transaminase levels usually fell slowly to pretreatment levels. The increases usually appeared 3 to 12 months after the start of therapy with lovastatin, and were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms.[F4661] In the EXCEL study,[A181925] the incidence of persistent increases in serum transaminases over 48 weeks was 0.1% for placebo, 0.1% at 20 mg/day, 0.9% at 40 mg/day, and 1.5% at 80 mg/day in patients on lovastatin. However, in post-marketing experience with lovastatin, symptomatic liver disease has been reported rarely at all dosages.[F4661]Lovastatin is a lactone which is readily hydrolyzed _in vivo_ to the corresponding β-hydroxyacid and strong inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, a hepatic microsomal enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A ) to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.[A181421,A174553] At therapeutic lovastatin doses, HMG-CoA reductase is not completely blocked, thereby allowing biologically necessary amounts of mevalonate to be available. Because the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate is an early step in the biosynthetic pathway for cholesterol, therapy with lovastatin would not be expected to cause an accumulation of potentially toxic sterols.[F4664]    Lovastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors which increase hepatic uptake of LDL. Lovastatin also inhibits hepatic synthesis of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). The overall effect is a decrease in plasma LDL and VLDL and a significant reduction in the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475]    A significant effect on LDL-C reduction was seen within 2 weeks of initiation of lovastatin, and the maximum therapeutic response occurred within 4-6 weeks. The response was maintained during continuation of therapy. Single daily doses given in the evening were more effective than the same dose given in the morning, perhaps because cholesterol is synthesized mainly at night. When therapy with lovastatin is stopped, total cholesterol has been shown to return to pre-treatment levels.[F4664]    In vitro and in vivo animal studies also demonstrate that lovastatin exerts vasculoprotective effects independent of its lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.[A181424] This includes improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response.    Statins have also been found to bind allosterically to β2 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an important role in leukocyte trafficking and in T cell activation.[A181559]    Lovastatin has been reported to have beneficial effects on certain cancers. This includes a multi-factorial stress-triggered cell death (apoptosis) and DNA degradation response in breast cancer cells.[A181937] It has also been shown to inhibit histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) activity and increase the accumulation of acetylated histone-H3 and the expression of p21(WAF/CIP) in human cancer cells, suggesting that statins might serve as novel HDAC inhibitors for cancer therapy and chemoprevention.[A15235]"
82,"Enflurane may be used for both the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. It can also be used to induce analgesia for vaginal delivery. Low concentrations of enflurane can also be used as an adjunct to general anesthetic drugs during delivery by Cesarean section.[L13646]Enflurane is a halogenated inhalational anesthetic initially approved by the FDA in 1972. Since this date, it has been withdrawn from the US market.[L13646,L13649] Unlike its other inhalational anesthetic counterparts including [isoflurane] and [halothane], enflurane is known to induce seizure activity. In addition, it is known to cause increased cardio depressant effects when compared to other inhaled anesthetics.[A202022]Enflurane rapidly induces anesthesia via the stimulation of inhibitory neural channels and the inhibition of excitatory neural channels. Muscle relaxation, obtundation of pharyngeal and laryngeal reflexes, and lowering of blood pressure are some of the main pharmacodynamic effects of this drug.[L13643] Enflurane also decreases cardiac muscle contractility.[A202022]      High concentrations of enflurane may lead to uterine relaxation and increase the risk of uterine bleeding during delivery.[L13643]  Rare but clinically significant elevations in ALT may indicate hepatoxicity from the use of enflurane.[A202016] In some susceptible patients, enflurane may cause malignant hyperthermia.[L13643]The mechanism of action of enflurane is not completely established.[L13643] Studies on rats indicate that enflurane binds to GABAA and glycine receptors, causing depressant effects at the ventral neural horn. It has been reported that 30% of the central nervous system depressant effects on the spinal cord after enflurane is administered are caused by the (GABA-A) receptor while binding to glycine receptors is responsible for about 20 % of the depressant effects.[A10308]  The relevance of these findings to humans is unknown. Other studies have found that enflurane binds to the calcium channels in the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum causing cardio depressant effects.[A202082,A202091,A202094] Other studies support that this drug potentiates glycine receptors, which results in central nervous system depressant effects.[A202097,A11019] "
83,For treatment of severe infections caused by susceptible bacteria.One of the cephalosporins that has a broad spectrum of activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms.Cefotiam is a third generation beta-lactam cephalosporin antibiotic that works by inhibiting bacterial cell wall biosynthesis. It is a broad spectrum antibiotic that is effective against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria.The bactericidal activity of cefotiam results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs).
84,"Pregabalin is indicated for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury, and as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients 1 month of age and older.[L7066]Pregabalin is structurally similar to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) - an inhibitory neurotransmitter.[A173995] It may be used to manage neuropathic pain, postherpetic neuralgia, and fibromyalgia among other conditions.[A187190] Although as per the FDA Label the mechanism of action has not been definitively characterized, there is evidence that pregabalin exerts its effects by binding to the α2δ subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels.[A187190,L7066] Pregabalin is marketed by Pfizer under the trade name Lyrica and Lyrica Cr (extended release).[L1006,L7066] It may have dependence liability if misused but the risk appears to be highest in patients with current or past substance use disorders.[A31161]Although the structure of pregabalin is similar to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), it does not bind to GABA receptors.[A31163,A187190] Instead, it binds the alpha2-delta subunit of presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels in the central nervous system.[A31163,A187190] Pregabalin does not modulate dopamine receptors, serotonin receptors, opiate receptors, sodium channels or cyclooxygenase activity.[A187190] Although the mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated, studies involving structurally related drugs suggest that presynaptic binding of pregabalin to voltage-gated calcium channels is key to the antiseizure and antinociceptive effects observed in animal models.[L7066]      By binding presynaptically to the alpha2-delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels in the central nervous system, pregabalin modulates the release of several excitatory neurotransmitters including glutamate, substance-P, norepinephrine, and calcitonin gene related peptide.[A31163] In addition, pregabalin prevents the alpha2-delta subunit from being trafficked from the dorsal root ganglia to the spinal dorsal horn, which may also contribute to the mechanism of action.[A36628]     Although pregabalin is a structural derivative of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), it does not bind directly to GABA or benzodiazepine receptors.[A31165]  "
85,"Temazepam is specifically indicated only for the short-term management of insomnia [FDA Label], [L5539]. Furthermore, such management is generally predominantly associated with the symptomatic relief of transient and short-term insomnia characterized by difficulty in falling asleep, frequent nocturnal awakenings and/or early morning awakenings [F3718]. In particular, the official prescribing information for temazepam typically specifies that the instructions issued for dispensed prescriptions of the medication should indicate specifically that patients are only expected to use the therapy for short periods of time - usually 7-10 days in general [FDA Label, F3718]. Subsequently, treatment with temazepam should usually not exceed 7 to 10 consecutive days and nor should it be prescribed in quantities exceeding a one-month supply [F3718].    Some regional prescribing information also notes that temazepam may be used for premedication prior to minor surgery or other related procedures [L5539].Temazepam, like many other similar and related benzodiazepines, acts as a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) modulator and is capable of eliciting a variety of actions including sedation, hypnosis, skeletal muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, and anxiolytic action [A175207, A175210, F3718, F3721].    Although the chemical synthesis of temazepam was established by 1965 [A175333], mainstream contemporary use of the medication did not occur until it's legitimate use as treatment for insomnia was accepted and approved later on. In particular, before temazepam saw regular prescription use in civilians it was - and still is - employed by the US military as a sedative-hypnotic medication to be taken by soldiers, pilots, etc. to obtain the necessary rest required for medical recovery or scheduled maneuvers and operations [A175339]. Regardless, temazepam has become one of the most frequently prescribed medications internationally and sees millions of prescriptions every year. Unfortunately, however, given its frequent use and the inherent nature of its pharmacological effects, temazepam - like many other benzodiazepines - possesses a high potential for misuse and is genuinely capable of developing drug tolerance, physical dependence, and addiction in users.Temazepam is a benzodiazepine used as a hypnotic agent in the management of insomnia [FDA Label] [A175207, A175210, L5539, F3718, F3721]. Temazepam produces CNS depression at limbic, thalamic, and hypothalamic levels of the CNS [A175207, A175210, F3718, F3721]. Temazepam increases the affinity of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) for GABA receptors by binding to benzodiazepine receptors [A175207, A175210, F3718, F3721]. Results are sedation, hypnosis, skeletal muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, and anxiolytic action [A175207, A175210, F3718, F3721].    In sleep laboratory studies, the effect of temazepam was compared to placebo during a two week period [F3718]. The studies demonstrated a linear dose-response improvement in total sleep time and sleep latency with substantial drug-placebo differences apparent for total sleep time and for sleep latency at higher doses of temazepam [F3718]. Regardless, REM sleep was ultimately unchanged but slow wave sleep was decreased [F3718].    Moreover, a transient syndrome, known as ""rebound insomnia"", wherein the symptoms that led to treatment with temazepam in the first place recur in an enhanced form, may happen on withdrawal of temazepam treatment [F3718]. The possibility of this occurrence is in part why long term use of temazepam is not recommended due to worries over tolerance and dependence wherein patients' bodies become physiologically accustomed to the regular presence and pharmacological effect of higher and higher doses of the benzodiazepine used [F3718].    The duration of hypnotic effect and the profile of unwanted adverse effects may be influenced by the distribution and elimination half-lives of the administered temazepam and any active metabolites that may be formed [F3718]. When such half-lives are long, the drug or its metabolite(s) may accumulate during periods of nightly administration and be associated with impairments of cognitive and motor performance during waking hours [F3718]. Conversely, if half-lives are short, the drug and metabolites would be cleared before the next dose is ingested, and carry-over effects related to sedation or CNS depression should be minimal or not present at all [F3718]. However, during nightly use and for an extended period, pharmacodynamic tolerance or adaptation to some effects of benzodiazepine hypnotics may develop - which may also contribute to the possibility of 'rebound insomnia' [F3718].    Consequently, if the drug has a very short elimination half-life, it is possible that a relative deficiency (for example, in relation to benzodiazepine GABA(a) receptor sites) may occur at some point in the interval between each night's use [F3718]. This sequence of events may account for certain clinical findings reported happening after several weeks of nightly use of rapidly eliminated benzodiazepine hypnotics, including increased wakefulness during the last third of the night and the appearance of increased daytime anxiety [F3718].Gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is considered the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the human body [A175207, A175210, F3718, F3721]. When GABA binds to GABA(a) receptors found in neuron synapses, chloride ions are conducted across neuron cell membranes via an ion channel in the receptors [A175207, A175210, F3718, F3721]. With enough chloride ions conducted, the local, associated neuron membrane potentials are hyperpolarized - making it more difficult or less likely for action potentials to fire, ultimately resulting in less excitation of the neurons [A175207, A175210, F3718, F3721].     Subsequently, benzodiazepines like temazepam can bind to benzodiazepine receptors that are components of various varieties of GABA(a) receptors [A175207, A175210, F3718, F3721]. This binding acts to enhance the effects of GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA(a) receptor, which ultimately enhances GABA ligand binding at the receptors [A175207, A175210, F3718, F3721]. This enhanced ligand binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA to the receptors increases the aforementioned chloride ion conduction (perhaps reportedly via an increase in the frequency of the chloride channel opening), resulting in a hyperpolarized cell membrane that prevents further excitation of the associated neuron cells [A175207, A175210, F3718, F3721]. Combined with the notion that such benzodiazepine receptor associated GABA(a) receptors exist both peripherally and in the CNS, this activity consequently facilitates various effects like sedation, hypnosis, skeletal muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, and anxiolytic action [A175207, A175210, F3718, F3721]."
86,"For use in the management of hypertension either as the sole therapeutic agent or to enhance the effect of other antihypertensive drugs in the more severe forms of hypertension. Also used as adjunctive therapy in edema associated with congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, and corticosteroid and estrogen therapy.A thiazide diuretic with properties similar to those of hydrochlorothiazide. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p825)Methyclothiazide, a diuretic-antihypertensive agent, is a member of the benzothiadiazine (thiazide) class of drugs. Methyclothiazide has a per mg natriuretic activity approximately 100 times that of the prototype thiazide, chlorothiazide. At maximal therapeutic dosages, all thiazides are approximately equal in their diuretic/natriuretic effects. Like other benzothiadiazines, methyclothiazide also has antihypertensive properties, and may be used for this purpose either alone or to enhance the antihypertensive action of other drugs.Methyclothiazide appears to block the active reabsorption of chloride and possibly sodium in the ascending loop of Henle, altering electrolyte transfer in the proximal tubule. This results in excretion of sodium, chloride, and water and, hence, diuresis. As a diuretic, methyclothiazide inhibits active chloride reabsorption at the early distal tubule via the Na-Cl cotransporter, resulting in an increase in the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water. Thiazides like methyclothiazide also inhibit sodium ion transport across the renal tubular epithelium through binding to the thiazide sensitive sodium-chloride transporter. This results in an increase in potassium excretion via the sodium-potassium exchange mechanism. The antihypertensive mechanism of methyclothiazide is less well understood although it may be mediated through its action on carbonic anhydrases in the smooth muscle or through its action on the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (KCa) channel, also found in the smooth muscle."
87," The sodium salt of the drug is better tolerated than the free acid.The two major considerations in the clinical pharmacology of aminosalicylic acid are the prompt production of a toxic inactive metabolite under acid conditions and the short serum half life of one hour for the free drug. Aminosalicylic acid is bacteriostatic against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (prevents the multiplying of bacteria without destroying them). It also inhibits the onset of bacterial resistance to streptomycin and isoniazid.There are two mechanisms responsible for aminosalicylic acid's bacteriostatic action against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Firstly, aminosalicylic acid inhibits folic acid synthesis (without potentiation with antifolic compounds). The binding of para-aminobenzoic acid to pteridine synthetase acts as the first step in folic acid synthesis. Aminosalicylic acid binds pteridine synthetase with greater affinity than para-aminobenzoic acid, effectively inhibiting the synthesis of folic acid. As bacteria are unable to use external sources of folic acid, cell growth and multiplication slows. Secondly, aminosalicylic acid may inhibit the synthesis of the cell wall component, mycobactin, thus reducing iron uptake by M. tuberculosis."
88,"Milrinone is indicated for the short-term (48 hours or less) treatment of patients with acute decompensated heart failure. Milrinone administration should occur together with close monitoring using appropriate electrocardiographic equipment and should occur in a facility equipped for the immediate treatment of potential cardiac events, including ventricular arrhythmias.[L31483]Heart failure is a multifactorial condition that affects roughly 1-2% of the adult population. Often the result of long-term myocardial ischemia, cardiomyopathy, or other cardiac insults, heart failure results from an inability of the heart to perfuse peripheral tissues with sufficient oxygen and metabolites, resulting in complex systemic pathologies. Heart failure is underpinned by numerous physiological changes, including alteration in β-adrenergic signalling and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production, which affects the heart's contractile function and cardiac output.[A228323] Milrinone is a second-generation bipyridine phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor created through chemical modification of [amrinone].[A228333] As a PDE-III inhibitor, milrinone results in increased cAMP levels and improves cardiac function and peripheral vasodilation in acute decongested heart failure.[A228338, A11759, A228323, A228333, A228348, L31483]    Milrinone was originally synthesized at the Sterling Winthrop Research Institute in the 1980s.[A228333] It was approved by the FDA on December 31, 1987, and was marketed under the trademark PRIMACOR® by Sanofi-Aventis US before being discontinued.[L31483]Milrinone is a bipyridine derivative with positive inotropic and lusitropic effects that also results in peripheral vasodilation with minimal chronotropic effects over a therapeutic range of 100 to 300 ng/mL.[L31483, A228358] As such, milrinone is used in decompensated congestive heart failure.[L31483] Studies have demonstrated that milrinone exhibits sigmoidal effects, such that increasing milrinone plasma concentrations beyond a certain level results in no further hemodynamic changes.[A228358] Despite milrinone's benefits, both intravenous and oral use has been associated with increased frequency of ventricular arrhythmias, and long-term oral use has been associated with an increased risk of sudden death; in general, there are no data to support the safety or efficacy of milrinone use beyond 48 hours and patients should be monitored closely for cardiac dysfunction.[L31483] Also, as milrinone is primarily excreted renally, dose adjustments may be required in patients with impaired renal function.[L31483] Heart failure is a condition characterized by the heart's inability to provide adequate perfusion to the peripheral tissues, resulting in systemic symptoms including pulmonary, gastrointestinal, renal, and cerebral dysfunction.[A228323] Although the biochemical and physiological processes underlying heart failure complex and variable, one such physiological response regulated by the sympathetic nervous system involves the eventual downregulation of cardiac β-receptors, decreased catecholamine sensitivity, and a corresponding decrease in adenylyl-cyclase-mediated signalling pathways.[A228323] Increased intracellular cAMP, mainly acting through protein kinase A, increases sarcolemmal calcium release through L-type calcium channels as well as calcium re-uptake mediated by phospholamban and troponin I; these actions correspond to positive inotropic and lusitropic effects, respectively.[A228323, A228333]    Milrinone is a partial competitive inhibitor of phosphodiesterase III (PDE-III), with a measured IC<sub>50</sub> value of between 0.66 and 1.3 μM.[A228338, A11759] As a PDE-III inhibitor, milrinone results in an increase in intracellular cAMP, responsible for its pharmacological effects, including positive inotropy, positive lusitropy, and vasodilation.[A228323, A228333, A228348] As milrinone affects cAMP levels through PDE-III and not through β-adrenergic receptors, it is effective in patients who have downregulated or otherwise desensitized β-adrenergic receptors and can be administered together with β-agonists/antagonists.[A228353, A228358]"
89,"For the treatment of polycythaemia vera and refractory chronic myeloid leukaemia.An antineoplastic agent that acts by alkylation.Pipobroman is an antineoplastic agent. Specifically, it is a piperazine derivative with a chemical structure close to that of many DNA alkylating agents. Pipobroman has well-documented clinical activity against polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia.The mechanism of action is uncertain, but due to the structural similarity with other DNA alkylating agents, pipobroman is thought to alkylate DNA leading to disruption of DNA synthesis and eventual cell death.[A6598]"
90,"Butabarbital is indicated for use as a sedative or hypnotic.[L13613] Butabarbital should not be used to treat insomnia for longer than 2 weeks.[L13613]Butabarbital, or Butisol, is a fast onset barbiturate with short duration of action compared to other barbiturates.[A201977,L13613] This makes butabarbital a useful drug for treating severe insomnia and pre-operative anxiety.[A201977,L13613] Butabarbital is less commonly used in recent years, as more patients are typically prescribed benzodiazepines.[A19735] Its short duration of action gives butabarbital a high abuse potential, comparable to [secobarbital].[A201977,A201980]    Butabarbital was granted FDA approval on 5 June 1939.[L13613]Butabarbital potentiates GABAergic neurons while inhibiting neuronal acetylcholine and glutamate receptors to produce sedation.[A4384,A202085] Butabarbital is an intermediate acting barbiturate with a duration of action of approximately 6-8 hours.[L13613] The therapeutic index is quite wide as doses vary considerably from patient to patient.[L13613] Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of worsening insomnia, drowsiness, falls, and complex behaviour while not fully awake.[L13613]Barbiturates like butabarbital potentiate GABA-A receptors and inhibit receptors for neuronal acetylcholine, and kainate.[A4384,A202085] GABA-A receptors are predominantly on the post-synaptic membrane, and upon activation, open chloride channels to hyperpolarize the neuron and decreased firing rate.[A202064] Potentiation of GABAergic neurons produces sedation.[A202064] Inhibition of neuronal acetylcholine receptors[A202085] and glutamate receptors of the kainate subtype[A202088] desensitize their respective neurons, producing sedation."
91,"A potent, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) used in combination with nucleoside analogues for treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) infection and AIDS. Structurally, nevirapine belongs to the dipyridodiazepinone chemical class.Nevirapine is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (nNRTI) with activity against Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1). HIV-2 RT and eukaryotic DNA polymerases (such as human DNA polymerases alpha, beta, or sigma) are not inhibited by nevirapine. Nevirapine is, in general, only prescribed after the immune system has declined and infections have become evident. It is always taken with at least one other HIV medication such as Retrovir or Videx. The virus can develop resistance to nevirapine if the drug is taken alone, although even if used properly, nevirapine is effective for only a limited time.Nevirapine binds directly to reverse transcriptase (RT) and blocks the RNA-dependent and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities by causing a disruption of the enzyme's catalytic site. The activity of nevirapine does not compete with template or nucleoside triphosphates."
92,"For treatment of dermal fungal infection.Oxiconazole is an antifungal agent that is commonly found in topical formulations. It is marketed under the brand names Oxistat and Oxistat, and is used in the treatment of various skin infections such as athlete's foot, jock itch and ringworm.Oxiconazole is a broad-spectrum imidazole derivative whose antifungal activity is derived primarily from the inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis, which is critical for cellular membrane integrity. It has fungicidal or fungistatic activity in vitro against a number of pathogenic fungi including the following dermatophytes, and yeasts: T. rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, T. violaceum, E. floccosum, M. canis,M. audouini, M. gypseum, C. albicans, and M. furfur.Oxiconazole inhibits ergosterol biosynthesis, which is required for cytoplasmic membrane integrity of fungi. It acts to destabilize the fungal cyctochrome P450 51 enzyme (also known as Lanosterol 14-alpha demethylase). This is vital in the cell membrance structure of the fungus. Its inhibition leads to cell lysis. Oxiconazole has also been shown in inhibit DNA synthesis and suppress intracellular concentrations of ATP. Like other imidazole antifungals, Oxiconazole can increase membrane permeability to zinc, augmenting its cytotoxicity."
93,"For the relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses.Alclometasone is synthetic glucocorticoid steroid for topical use in dermatology as anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, antiallergic, antiproliferative and vasoconstrictive agent.Alclometasone is a synthetic corticosteroid for topical dermatologic use. The corticosteroids constitute a class of primarily synthetic steroids used topically as anti-inflammatory and antipruritic agents. Alclometasone is a selective glucocorticoid receptor agonist.The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2. Alclometasone initially binds the corticosteroid receptor. This complex migrates to the nucleus where it binds to different glucocorticoid response elements on the DNA. This in turn enhances and represses various genes, especially those involved in inflammatory pathways."
94,"[L10370]Butalbital, or 5-allyl-5-isobutylbarbituric acid, is a derivative of barbituric acid which the hydrogens at position 5 are substituted by an allyl group and an isobutyl group. It is a short-to-intermediate acting member of barbiturates that exhibit muscle-relaxing and anti-anxiety properties that produce central nervous system (CNS) depression that ranges from mild sedation to general anesthesia.[A177754] Butalbital has a low degree of selectivity and a narrow therapeutic index.There have not been clinical trials that evaluate the clinical efficacy of butalbital in migraines [A177754] thus it is not indicated for such condition. As with other barbiturates, butalbital carries a risk of abuse or misuse potential, intoxication, hangover, tolerance, dependence, and overdosage possibly leading to death.[L10370] Butalbital‐containing analgesics can also produce a drug‐induced headache in addition to tolerance and dependence. Due to these risks, the use of butalbital-containing combination products is typically limited for use only in cases where other medications are deemed ineffective and such usage is advised to be carefully monitored.[A177754]Butalbital is a short to intermediate-acting barbiturate that reversibly depresses the activity of excitable tissues, including the central nervous system in a nonselective manner.[A177754] Barbiturates exhibit muscle-relaxing and anti-anxiety properties [A177763] and they are capable of producing all levels of CNS mood alteration from excitation to mild sedation, hypnosis, and deep coma.[F4561] The sedative dose of butalbital in nontolerant individuals is 5-100 mg and the hypnotic dose is 100-200 mg.[T598] Pain perception and reaction are relatively unimpaired until the moment of unconsciousness.[A177754] In some cases, an unwanted paradoxical response of excitement may be observed instead of sedation with barbiturate treatment, which may be due to their depressant effects on inhibitory centers of the CNS.[A177754] At sufficiently high therapeutic doses, barbiturates induce anesthesia; however, barbiturates are reported to lose their effectiveness for sleep induction and sleep maintenance after 2 weeks.[F4561] Barbiturates are habit-forming; they can produce tolerance and both dependence and addiction, which is partly explained by decreased drug concentration at the site of action due to enhanced drug metabolism by induced enzymes, or to cellular adaptive changes. In addition, butalbital may lead to analgesic overuse headache.[A177754]     While butalbital is expected to mediate similar actions as other members of the barbiturate drug class, the effects of butalbital in isolation are not well understood.[A177763] It is suggested that butalbital is added in combination products to antagonize the unwanted central stimulating effect of stimulatory ingredients such as caffeine.[A177763] Butalbital may decrease blood pressure and heart rate when administered at sedative and hypnotic doses.[L10370]Butalbital is a CNS depressant that suppresses neuronal excitability, impulse conduction, and the release of neurotransmitters, similar to actions of other barbiturates.[T598] Barbiturates primarily mediate suppressive actions on polysynaptic neuronal responses by diminishing facilitation while enhancing inhibition.[A177754] Inhibition occurs at GABAergic synapses that express GABA-A receptors, which are transmembrane chloride ion channels that bind an inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, neurosteroids, and ethanol.[A177754] Upon activation, GABA-A receptors allow Cl- influx and K+ efflux into the postjunctional terminal, resulting in inhibition of the postsynaptic neuron. It is suggested that barbiturates, including butalbital, enhances GABA binding to the GABA-A receptors [F4561] by binding to the α+/β�?interface in the intracellular domain (ICD) as an allosteric modulator.[A177754] Barbiturates potentiate GABA-induced increases in chloride conductance and depress voltage-activated calcium currents while prolonging the duration of GABA-induced chloride channel opening.[A177754] Butalbital may also inhibit the excitatory effects mediated by AMPA receptors by reducing glutamate-induced depolarizations of the receptor. It is also proposed that barbiturates and opioids may potentiate the analgesic effects of each other when co-administered, although there are inconsistencies across preclinical data.[A177754]"
95,"For the treatment of active hairy cell leukemia (leukemic reticuloendotheliosis) as defined by clinically significant anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or disease-related symptoms. Also used as an alternative agent for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.An antineoplastic agent used in the treatment of lymphoproliferative diseases including hairy-cell leukemia.Cladribine is a synthetic purine nucleoside that acts as an antineoplastic agent with immunosuppressive effects. Cladribine differs structurally from deoxyadenosine only by the presence of a chlorine atom at position 2 of the purine ring, which results in resistance to enzymatic degradation by adenosine deaminase. Due to this resistance, cladribine exhibits a more prolonged cytotoxic effect than deoxyadenosine against resting and proliferating lymphocytes. Cladribine is one of a group of chemotherapy drugs known as the anti-metabolites.&nbsp;Anti-metabolites stop cells from making and repairing DNA, which are processes that are necessary for cancer cells to grow and multiply.Cladribine is structurally related to fludarabine and pentostatin but has a different mechanism of action. Although the exact mechanism of action has not been fully determined, evidence shows that cladribine is phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase to the nucleotidecladribine triphosphate (CdATP; 2-chloro-2�?deoxyadenosine 5�?triphosphate), which accumulates and is incorporated into DNA in cells such as lymphocytes that contain high levels of deoxycytidine kinase and low levels of deoxynucleotidase, resulting in DNA strand breakage and inhibition of DNA synthesis and repair. High levels of CdATP also appear to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase, which leads to an imbalance in triphosphorylated deoxynucleotide (dNTP) pools and subsequent DNA strand breaks, inhibition of DNA synthesis and repair, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and ATP depletion, and cell death. Unlike other antimetabolite drugs, cladribine has cytotoxic effects on resting as well as proliferating lymphocytes. However, it does cause cells to accumulate at the G1/S phase junction, suggesting that cytotoxicity is associated with events critical to cell entry into S phase. It also binds purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), however no relationship between this binding and a mechanism of action has been established."
96,"Mesalazine is indicated for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in adults and patients 5 years or older.[L36280,L36275]. Mesalazine is also indicated for the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis in adults and maintenance of remission of Crohn's ileocolitis.[L44196,L5101]  An anti-inflammatory agent, structurally related to the salicylates and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like acetylsalicylic acid, which is active in inflammatory bowel disease [A174022]. Although demonstrably effective in treating and maintaining remission for ulcerative colitis, mesalazine has historically faced a number of issues regarding its lack of stability as a pharmaceutical agent [A174019]. Throughout the late seventies and the eighties, important research initiatives developed stable mesalazine formulations like the eudragit-S coating of Asacol brand mesalazine and the Pentasa brand's encapsulation of mesalazine within microgranules [A174019]. In the present day, contemporary research regarding novel methods to stabilize mesalazine continues and interest in the agent's capacity to decrease inflammatory activity and subsequently potentially reduce the risk of colorectal cancer in conditions like ulcerative colitis is maintained.[A174019,A174022]Mesalazine is one of the two components of sulphasalazine, the other being sulphapyridine. It is the latter responsible for most of the side effects associated with sulphasalazine therapy, while mesalazine is known to be the active moiety in the treatment of ulcerative colitis [L5101].    Mesalazine is thought to dampen the inflammatory process through its ability to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, interfere with leukotriene synthesis, and consequent leukocyte migration as well as act as a potent scavenger of free radicals.[L37023] Regardless of the mode of action, mesalazine appears to be active mainly topically rather than systemically.L36230] Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease, and it is possible that mesalazine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon.[L36230]    Furthermore, mesalazine also has the potential to inhibit the activation of Nuclear Factor kappa B (NFkB) and consequently the production of key pro-inflammatory cytokines.[A16800,A4391,A16799] It has been proposed that reduced expression of PPAR gamma nuclear receptors (gamma form of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors) may be implicated in ulcerative colitis, and that mesalazine produces pharmacodynamic effects through direct activation of PPAR gamma receptors in the colonic/rectal epithelium.[A16797,A16798,A16516,A16515] Other research also showed the potential involvement of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and that mesalazine can inhibit this enzyme to amiliorate the enteropathy in inflammatory bowel diseases.[L37023]     Moreover, since increased leukocyte migration, abnormal cytokine production, increased production of arachidonic acid metabolites, particularly leukotriene B4, and increased free radical formation in the inflamed intestinal tissue are all present in patients with inflammatory bowel disease it is also believed that mesalazine has in-vitro and in-vivo pharmacological effects that inhibit leukocyte chemotaxis, decrease cytokine and leukotriene production and scavenge for free radicals.[L5107]"
97,"Benztropine is indicated to be used as an adjunct in the therapy of all forms of parkinsonism. It can also be used for the control of extrapyramidal disorders due to neuroleptic drugs.[T203]    The extrapyramidal symptoms are defined as drug-induced disorders that include symptoms of dystonia, akathisia, parkinsonism, bradykinesia, tremors, and dyskinesia.[A175120]     Parkinsonism is a general term that refers to the group of neurological disorders that produce symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease such as tremors, slow movement, and stiffness. The parkinsonism includes a large number of disorders and some of them have not been clearly defined.[L5509]Benztropine, with the chemical formula 3alpha-diphenylmethoxytropane, is a tropane-based dopamine inhibitor used for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease. It is a combination molecule between a tropane ring, similar to cocaine, and a diphenyl ether from the dialkylpiperazines determined to be a dopamine uptake inhibitor since 1970. The generation of structure-activity relationships proved that benztropine derivatives with the presence of a chlorine substituent in the para position in one of the phenyl rings produces an increased potency for dopamine uptake inhibition as well as a decreased inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine.[A37914] Benztropine was developed by USL Pharma and officially approved by the FDA on 1996.[L5500]The inhibition of dopamine reuptake by benztropine produces a dose-dependent increase of dopamine in the nerve terminal of the dopaminergic system.[A1628]     Clinically the activity of benztropine is observed after 1-2 hours of oral administration and after a few minutes of intramuscular administration with a last-longing effect of about 24 hours. Reports have indicated that benztropine has a very large sedative effect.[A1628]    The antihistaminic effect of benztropine is very similar to the effect found in [pyrilamine] and the anticholinergic activity was found to be equal to [atropine] _ex vivo_ and of about 50% activity _in vivo_.[F3679]Benztropine is an agent with anti-muscarinic and antihistaminic effects. Its main mechanism of action is presented by the selective inhibition of dopamine transporters but it also presents affinity for histamine and muscarine receptors.[A175084]    It is widely known that benztropine is a potent inhibitor of presynaptic carrier-mediated dopamine transport. As well, it is known to be an analog of atropine and hence, it has a large affinity for muscarinic receptors M1 in the human brain. Once bound, benztropine blocks the activity of the muscarinic receptors mainly in the striatum.[A1628]    The increased advantage of benztropine lays on the antagonism of acetylcholine activity which corrects the imbalance between dopamine and acetylcholine in Parkinson patients.[F3679]"
98,"In its oral form, ziprasidone is approved for the treatment of schizophrenia, as monotherapy for acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes related to bipolar I disorder, and as adjunctive therapy to lithium or valproate for maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder.[L7342] The injectable formulation is approved only for treatment of acute agitation in schizophrenia.[L7342]Disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder can significantly impair mood, cognition, and behavior.[A190525] These mental illnesses can often be accompanied by comorbidities such as depression and substance abuse, and can significantly impact the quality of life of patients and caregivers.[A190525] Luckily, several treatment options for psychotic disorders have been introduced to market since the realization of chlorpromazine's antipsychotic properties in 1952.[A190525]     Second generation antipsychotics (commonly referred to as atypical antipsychotics) include [clozapine], [quetiapine], [olanzapine], [aripiprazole] and [ziprasidone] among others, and are generally thought to be as efficacious as first generation antipsychotics but differ in their adverse effect profiles.[A190525,A190534] First generation antipsychotics are associated with extrapyramidal adverse effects while atypical antipsychotics are linked to weight gain, impaired glucose tolerance and metabolic syndrome.[A190534,A190537]     Ziprasidone is used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.[A180748] It can effectively reduce the rate and time of relapses in schizophrenia, and can be used to treat manic episodes in bipolar disorder although the mechanism of action is unknown.[A180748] Although ziprasidone is classified as an atypical antipsychotic, it appears to have a lower incidence of metabolic adverse effects compared to other medications in the same class.[A190525]Ziprasidone is classified as a ""second generation"" or ""atypical"" antipsychotic and is a dopamine and 5HT2A receptor antagonist with a unique receptor binding profile.  As previously mentioned, ziprasidone has a very high 5-HT2A/D2 affinity ratio, binds to multiple serotonin receptors in addition to 5-HT2A, and blocks monoamine transporters which prevents 5HT and NE reuptake.  On the other hand, ziprasidone has a low affinity for muscarinic cholinergic M1, histamine H1, and alpha1-adrenergic receptors.[A174562]The effects of ziprasidone are differentiated from other antispychotics based on its preference and affinity for certain receptors. Ziprasidone binds to serotonin-2A (5-HT2A) and dopamine D2 receptors in a similar fashion to other atypical antipsychotics; however, one key difference is that ziprasidone has a higher 5-HT2A/D2 receptor affinity ratio when compared to other antipsychotics such as olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and aripiprazole.[A363]  Ziprasidone offers enhanced modulation of mood, notable negative symptom relief, overall cognitive improvement and reduced motor dysfunction which is linked to it's potent interaction with 5-HT2C, 5-HT1D, and 5-HT1A receptors in brain tissue.[A363] Ziprasidone can bind moderately to norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake sites which may contribute to its antidepressant and anxiolytic activity.[A363] Patient's taking ziprasidone will likely experience a lower incidence of orthostatic hypotension, cognitive disturbance, sedation, weight gain, and disruption in prolactin levels since ziprasidone has a lower affinity for histamine H1, muscarinic M1, and alpha1-adrenoceptors.[A363]  "
99,"For the treatment of vascular headacheAn ergot derivative that is a congener of lysergic acid diethylamide.  It antagonizes the effects of serotonin in blood vessels and gastrointestinal smooth muscle, but has few of the properties of other ergot alkaloids. Methysergide is used prophylactically in migraine and other vascular headaches and to antagonize serotonin in the carcinoid syndrome.Methysergide has been shown,in vitro and in vivo, to inhibit or block the effects of serotonin, a substance which may be involved in the mechanism of vascular headaches. Serotonin has been variously described as a central neurohumoral agent or chemical mediator, as a ""headache substance"" acting directly or indirectly to lower pain threshold, as an intrinsic ""motor hormone"" of the gastrointestinal tract, and as a ""hormone"" involved in connective tissue reparative processes.Methysergide is serotonin antagonists acts on central nervous system (CNS), which directly stimulates the smooth muscle leading to vasoconstriction. Some alpha-adrenergic blocking activity has been reported. Suggestions have been made by investigators as to the mechanism whereby Methysergide produces its clinical effects, but this has not been finally established, although it may be related to the antiserotonin effect."
100,"For the treatment of hyperprolactinemic disorders, either idiopathic or due to prolactinoma (prolactin-secreting adenomas). May also be used to manage symptoms of Parkinsonian Syndrome as monotherapy during initial symptomatic management or as an adjunct to levodopa therapy during advanced stages of disease. Cabergoline, an ergot derivative, is a long-acting dopamine agonist and prolactin inhibitor. It is used to treat hyperprolactinemic disorders and Parkinsonian Syndrome. Cabergoline possesses potent agonist activity on dopamine D2 receptors.Cabergoline stimulates centrally-located dopaminergic receptors resulting in a number of pharmacologic effects. Five dopamine receptor types from two dopaminergic subfamilies have been identified. The dopaminergic D1 receptor subfamily consists of D1 and D5 subreceptors, which are associated with dyskinesias. The dopaminergic D2 receptor subfamily consists of D2, D3 and D4 subreceptors, which are associated with improvement of symptoms of movement disorders. Thus, agonist activity specific for D2 subfamily receptors, primarily D2 and D3receptor subtypes, are the primary targets of dopaminergic antiparkinsonian agents. It is thought that postsynaptic D2 stimulation is primarily responsible for the antiparkinsonian effect of dopamine agonists, while presynaptic D2 stimulation confers neuroprotective effects. This semisynthetic ergot derivative exhibits potent agonist activity on dopamine D2- and D3-receptors. It also exhibits: agonist activity (in order of decreasing binding affinities) on 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)2B, 5-HT2A, 5-HT1D, dopamine D4, 5-HT1A, dopamine D1, 5-HT1B and 5-HT2C receptors and antagonist activity on &alpha;2B, &alpha;2A, and &alpha;2C receptors. Parkinsonian Syndrome manifests when approximately 80% of dopaminergic activity in the nigrostriatal pathway of the brain is lost. As this striatum is involved in modulating the intensity of coordinated muscle activity (e.g. movement, balance, walking), loss of activity may result in dystonia (acute muscle contraction), Parkinsonism (including symptoms of bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, and flattened affect), akathesia (inner restlessness), tardive dyskinesia (involuntary muscle movements usually associated with long-term loss of dopaminergic activity), and neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which manifests when complete blockage of nigrostriatal dopamine occurs. High dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway of the brain causes hallucinations and delusions; these side effects of dopamine agonists are manifestations seen in patients with schizophrenia who have overractivity in this area of the brain. The hallucinogenic side effects of dopamine agonists may also be due to 5-HT2A agonism. The tuberoinfundibular pathway of the brain originates in the hypothalamus and terminates in the pituitary gland. In this pathway, dopamine inhibits lactotrophs in anterior pituitary from secreting prolactin. Increased dopaminergic activity in the tuberoinfundibular pathway inhibits prolactin secretion. The dopamine D2 receptor is a 7-transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor associated with Gi proteins. In lactotrophs, stimulation of dopamine D2 causes inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, which decreases intracellular cAMP concentrations and blocks IP3-dependent release of Ca2+from intracellular stores. Decreases in intracellular calcium levels may also be brought about via inhibition of calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels, rather than via inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Additionally, receptor activation blocks phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK and decreases MAPK/ERK kinase phosphorylation. Inhibition of MAPK appears to be mediated by c-Raf and B-Raf-dependent inhibition of MAPK/ERK kinase. Dopamine-stimulated growth hormone release from the pituitary gland is mediated by a decrease in intracellular calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels rather than via adenylyl cyclase inhibition. Stimulation of dopamine D2 receptors in the nigrostriatal pathway leads to improvements in coordinated muscle activity in those with movement disorders. Cabergoline is a long-acting dopamine receptor agonist with a high affinity for D2 receptors. Receptor-binding studies indicate that cabergoline has low affinity for dopamine D1, &alpha;1,- and &alpha;2- adrenergic, and 5-HT1- and 5-HT2-serotonin receptors."
101,"For the treatment and management of leprosy and dermatitis herpetiformis.A sulfone active against a wide range of bacteria but mainly employed for its actions against mycobacterium leprae. Its mechanism of action is probably similar to that of the sulfonamides which involves inhibition of folic acid synthesis in susceptible organisms. Dapsone is the principal drug in a multidrug regimen recommended by the World Health Organization for the treatment of leprosy. As an anti-infective agent, it is also used for treating malaria and, recently, for Pneumocystic carinii pneumonia in AIDS patients. Dapsone is absorbed rapidly and nearly completely from the gastrointestinal tract. Dapsone is distributed throughout total body water and is present in all tissues. However, it tends to be retained in skin and muscle and especially in the liver and kidney: traces of the drug are present in these organs up to 3 weeks after therapy cessation.Dapsone acts against bacteria and protozoa in the same way as sulphonamides, that is by inhibiting the synthesis of dihydrofolic acid through competition with para-amino-benzoate for the active site of dihydropteroate synthetase. The anti-inflammatory action of the drug is unrelated to its antibacterial action and is still not fully understood."
102,"For the treatment of candidiasis (a yeast-like fungal infection) of the vulva and vagina.Terconazole is an anti-fungal drug that is mainly used to treat vaginal yeast infections (or vaginal candidiasis). It is classified as a _triazole ketal derivative_.[A178096] Terconazole was initially approved by the FDA in 1987.[FDA label] This drug is available in cream and suppository forms and both have demonstrated high levels of safety, efficacy, and tolerability in clinical trials. [A178093]Due to the existence of 2 stereocentres, there are 4 possible stereoisomers for terconazole.Terconazole is a triazole antifungal agent available for intravaginal use. It is structurally related to imidazole-derivative antifungal agents, although terconazole and other triazoles have 3 nitrogens in the azole ring. By inhibiting the 14-alpha-demethylase (lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase), Terconazole inhibits ergosterol synthesis. Depletion of ergosterol in fungal membrane disrupts the structure and many functions of fungal membrane leading to inhibition of fungal growth.Terconazole may exert its antifungal activity by disrupting normal fungal cell membrane permeability. Terconazole and other triazole antifungal agents inhibit cytochrome P450 14-alpha-demethylase in susceptible fungi, which leads to the accumulation of lanosterol and other methylated sterols and a decrease in ergosterol concentration. Depletion of ergosterol in the membrane disrupts the structure and function of the fungal cell leading to a decrease or inhibition of fungal growth."
103,"Phenytoin is indicated to treat grand mal seizures, complex partial seizures, and to prevent and treat seizures during or following neurosurgery.[L9362] Injectable phenytoin and [Fosphenytoin], which is the phosphate ester prodrug formulation of phenytoin[A188571], are indicated to treat tonic-clonic status epilepticus, and for the prevention and treatment of seizures occurring during neurosurgery.[L10740]Phenytoin is classified as a hydantoin derivative and despite its narrow therapeutic index, it is one of the most commonly used anticonvulsants.[A33595,A188832,A189219] Since it's introduction about 80 years ago, phenytoin has not only been established as an effective anti-epileptic, but has also been investigated for several other indications such as bipolar disorder, retina protection, and wound healing.[A188826,A188832]    Clinicians are advised to initiate therapeutic drug monitoring in patients who require phenytoin since even small deviations from the recommended therapeutic range can lead to suboptimal treatment, or adverse effects.[A189219,A35884] Both parenteral and oral formulations of phenytoin are available on the market.[A189219]Phenytoin is an anticonvulsant with a narrow therapeutic index.[A188772] Although the recommended therapeutic range is cited to be between 10-20 mg/L, differences in albumin levels, genetics, comorbidities, and body composition can make achieving an ideal phenytoin dose challenging.[A188772] For example, studies have confirmed that phenytoin metabolism is impacted by CYP2C9 genotype polymorphisms and possibly by CYP2C19 genotype polymorphisms (the latter has not been as extensively studied).[A188772]    It is worth nothing that although phenytoin is highly protein bound, only the fraction unbound is able to exert a pharmacological effect.[L10980] Therefore, factors that reduce or increase the percentage of protein bound phenytoin (for example: concomitant administration of drugs that can cause displacement from protein binding sites) can have a marked impact on phenytoin therapy.[A188760,L10980]  Although phenytoin first appeared in the literature in 1946, it has taken decades for the mechanism of action to be more specifically elucidated.[A188826] Although several scientists were convinced that phenytoin altered sodium permeability, it wasn’t until the 1980’s that this phenomenon was linked to voltage-gated sodium channels.[A188826]     Phenytoin is often described as a non-specific sodium channel blocker and targets almost all voltage-gated sodium channel subtypes.[A188826] More specifically, phenytoin prevents seizures by inhibiting the positive feedback loop that results in neuronal propagation of high frequency action potentials.[A188772,A189219,A189273]  "
104,"For the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis, vernal conjunctivitis, episcleritis, and epinephrine sensitivity.Medrysone is a corticosteroid used in ophthalmology.Medrysone is a topical anti-inflammatory corticoidsteroids for ophthalmic use. In patients with increased intraocular pressure and in those susceptible to a rise in intraocular pressure, there is less effect on pressure with medrysone than with dexamethasone or betamethasone. Corticoidsteroids inhibit the edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, and phagocytic migration of the acute inflammatory response, as well as capillary proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation.There is no generally accepted explanation for the mechanism of action of ocular corticosteroids. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2. Initially, the drug binds to the glucocorticoid receptor in the cytosol. This migrates to the nucleus and binds to genetic elements which cause activation and repression of the involved genes in the inflammatory pathway."
105,"Doxycycline is indicated for the treatment of various infections by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, aerobes and anaerobes, as well other types of bacteria, including:    - Early Lyme disease (as evidenced by erythema migraines) due to _Borrelia burgdorferi_ in adults and pediatric patients 8 years of age and older weighing 45 kg and above [L42875]  - Rickettsial infections,[L42870] such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus fever and the typhus group, Q fever, rickettsialpox, and tick fevers [L42880]  - Sexually transmitted infections [L42870]  - Respiratory tract infections [L42870] caused by _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ and _Haemophilus influenzae_ [L42880]  - Specific bacterial infections [L42870] after indicative bacteriologic testing. These include infections caused by _Escherichia coli_, _Enterobacter aerogenes_, _Shigella_ species, _Acinetobacter_ species, and _Klebsiella_ species [L42880]  - Ophthalmic infections,[L42870] such as inclusion conjunctivitis caused by _Chlamydia trachomatis_ [L42880]  - Anthrax, including inhalational anthrax (post-exposure) [L42870]  - Alternative treatment for selected infections when [penicillin] is contraindicated [L42870]  - Adjunctive therapy in acute intestinal amebiasis and severe acne [L42870, L42880]  - Lymphogranuloma venereum caused by _Chlamydia trachomatis_ [L42880]  - Psittacosis (ornithosis) caused by _Chlamydophila psittaci_ [L42880]  - Trachoma caused by _Chlamydia trachomatis_, although the infectious agent is not always eliminated, as judged by immunofluorescence [L42880]  - Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infections in adults caused by _Chlamydia trachomatis_ [L42880]  - Nongonococcal urethritis caused by _Ureaplasma urealyticum_ [L42880]  - Relapsing fever due to _Borrelia recurrentis_ [L42880]  - Prophylaxis of malaria due to _Plasmodium falciparum_ in short-term travelers (<4 months) to areas with chloroquine and/or pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine resistant strains [L42870, L42880]    It is also used to treat infections caused by the following gram-negative microorganisms:    - Chancroid caused by _Haemophilus ducreyi_ [L42880]  - Plague due to _Yersinia pestis_ [L42880]  - Tularemia due to _Francisella tularensis_ [L42880]  - Cholera caused by _Vibrio cholerae_ [L42880]  - Campylobacter fetus infections caused by _Campylobacter fetus_ [L42880]  - Brucellosis due to _Brucella_ species (in conjunction with [streptomycin]) [L42880]  - Bartonellosis due to _Bartonella bacilliformis_ [L42880]  - Granuloma inguinale caused by _Klebsiella granulomatis_ [L42880]Doxycycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic synthetically derived from [oxytetracycline].[L42880] It is a second-generation tetracycline that was first discovered in 1967.[A19429] Second-generation tetracyclines exhibit lesser toxicity than first-generation tetracyclines.[A174034] Doxycycline is used to treat a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections. It is also used to treat acne and malaria.[A251730]Doxycycline and other tetracyclines are mainly bacteriostatic and are thought to exert antimicrobial effects by the inhibition of protein synthesis. They suppress the growth of bacteria or keep them in the stationary phase of growth.[A174025] Tetracyclines have antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms.[L42870] Cross-resistance of these microorganisms to tetracyclines is a common occurrence.[L42870]     As it is a highly lipophilic drug, doxycycline crosses multiple membranes of target molecules.[A251730] Doxycycline shows favorable intra-cellular penetration, with bacteriostatic activity against a wide range of bacteria.[A174028] Doxycycline also exhibits antiparasitic properties [A372, A373, A174025] and anti-inflammatory actions.[A174031, A251730] Its anti-inflammatory effects were investigated in various inflammatory skin conditions, such as bullous dermatoses [A251730] and rosacea.[A174031, A251730]Protein synthesis is essential for survival and functioning of cells, including bacteria.[A251725] Doxycycline inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by allosterically binding to the 30S prokaryotic ribosomal subunit.[A251730, L42870] The drug blocks the association charged aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) with the ribosomal A site, which is the acceptor site on the mRNA-ribosome complex. Doxycycline ultimately impedes the elongation phase of protein synthesis and halts the production of essential proteins for bacterial survival and functioning.[A251725, A251730]    Doxycycline mediates anti-inflammatory actions by preventing calcium-dependent microtubular assembly and lymphocytic proliferation, thereby inhibiting leukocyte movement during inflammation.[A251730] It also inhibits nitric oxide synthase, which is an enzyme that produces nitric oxide, an inflammatory signaling molecule.[A251730]"
106,"Lymecycline is used for the treatment of acne in addition to other susceptible infections; propionibacterium is often the cause of acne.[L13880]  Some of the infections that can be treated with lymecycline include upper respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, bronchitis, chlamydial infections, and rickettsial infections.[L13883]Lymecycline is a broad-spectrum second-generation tetracycline antibiotic used for the treatment of acne and other susceptible bacterial infections.[L13880,L13883] It has been proven a cost-effective alternative to treatment with [minocycline] with comparable safety and efficacy.[A203255] Lymecycline was initially discovered in 1961. It is marketed by Galderma and used in the UK as well as New Zealand in addition to other countries. Lymecycline is not marketed in the USA, however, equivalent drugs are available, such as minocycline and [tetracycline].[A19429,L13880]Lymecycline, like other tetracyclines, exerts bacteriostatic actions on intracellular and extracellular bacteria, treating susceptible bacterial infections.[L13883] It has been shown to be safe and effective in the  treatment of moderate to severe acne.[A203249]    It is important to note that like other tetracyclines, lymecycline may cause esophageal irritation and ulceration, which can be prevented by drinking adequate fluids during administration. It also has the potential to cause photosensitivity. Lymecycline can lead to renal tubular acidosis or hepatic toxicity.  It is not recommended to administer this drug in patients with renal disease or severe hepatic disease.[L13880,L13883]Normally, the ribosome synthesizes proteins through the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex. Lymecycline binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit, preventing amino-acyl tRNA from binding to the A site of the ribosome, which prevents the elongation of polypeptide chains.[A19429,A174040,L13880] This results in bacteriostatic actions, treating various infections."
107,"**Topical preparations**    Clotrimazole topical cream is indicated for the topical treatment of the following dermal infections [F3088], [F3121]:    Tinea pedis, tinea cruris, and tinea corporis due to _Trichophyton rubrum_, _Trichophyton mentagrophytes_, _Epidermophyton floccosum_    Candidiasis due to _Candida albicans_    Tinea versicolor due to _Malassezia furfur_    Diaper rash infected by _Candida albicans_      In some preparations, clotrimazole may be combined with betamethasone dipropionate, a corticosteroid [F3121].     **Oral preparations**    The oral troche preparation is indicated for the local treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis [FDA label].  It is also indicated as a prophylactic drug to reduce the incidence of oropharyngeal candidiasis in patients immunocompromised by conditions such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or steroid therapy utilized in the treatment of leukemia, solid tumors, or renal transplantation [FDA label]. Troche preparations are not indicated for the treatment of any systemic mycoses [FDA label].This drug is a broad spectrum antimycotic or antifungal agent. Clotrimazole's antimycotic properties were discovered in the late 1960s [A174094]. Clotrimazole falls under the _imidazole_ category of _azole_ antifungals, possessing broad-spectrum antimycotic activity [A174094].  It is available in various preparations, including creams, pessaries, and troche formulations (slowly dissolving tablets).  As well as its antifungal activity, clotrimazole has become a drug of interest in treating several other diseases such as sickle cell disease, malaria and some cancers [A174094].  The minimal side effect profile of this drug and its uncomplicated metabolic profile have led it to gain widespread acceptance for the treatment of mycotic outbreaks such as vaginal yeast infections as well as athlete's foot [A174097].Clotrimazole is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent that inhibits the growth of pathogenic yeasts by changing the permeability of cell membranes. The action of clotrimazole is fungistatic at concentrations of drug up to 20 mcg/mL and may be fungicidal _in vitro_ against Candida albicans and other species of the genus Candida at higher concentrations [FDA label]. Unfortunately, resistance to clotrimazole, which was rare in the past, is now common in various patient populations [A174094].     Clotrimazole is generally considered to be a fungistatic, and not a fungicidal drug, although this contrast is not absolute, as clotrimazole shows fungicidal properties at higher concentrations [A174094].    Clotrimazole acts primarily by damaging the permeability barrier in the cell membrane of fungi. Clotrimazole causes inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis, an essential constituent of fungal cell membranes. If ergosterol synthesis is either completely or partially inhibited, the cell is no longer able to construct an intact and functional cell membrane [F3088],[F3100]. Because ergosterol directly promotes the growth of fungal cells in a hormone‐like fashion, rapid onset of the above events leads to dose-dependent inhibition of fungal growth [A174094].    Though decreased ergosterol, due to the inhibition of lanosterol 14-demethylase (also known as _CYP51_) [A174094] is accepted to be primarily responsible for the antimycotic properties of clotrimazole, this drug also shows other pharmacological effects. These include the inhibition of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+‐ATPase,  depletion of intracellular calcium, and blocking of calcium‐dependent potassium channels and voltage‐dependent calcium channels [A174094]. The action of clotrimazole on these targets accounts for other effects of this drug that are separate from its antimycotic activities [A174094]."
108,"Calcium acetate is one of a number of calcium salts used to treat hyperphosphatemia (too much phosphate in the blood) in patients with kidney disease.The chemical compound calcium acetate is the calcium salt of acetic acid. It has been commonly referred to as the acetate of lime. The anhydrous form is very hygroscopic, therefore the monohydrate is the common form.Patients with advanced renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min) exhibit phosphate retention and some degree of hyperphosphatemia. The retention of phosphate plays a pivotal role in causing secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with osteodystrophy, and soft-tissue calcification. The mechanism by which phosphate retention leads to hyperparathyroidism is not clearly delineated. Therapeutic efforts directed toward the control of hyperphosphatemia include reduction in the dietary intake of phosphate, inhibition of absorption of phosphate in the intestine with phosphate binders, and removal of phosphate from the body by more efficient methods of dialysis. The rate of removal of phosphate by dietary manipulation or by dialysis is insufficient. Dialysis patients absorb 40% to 80% of dietary phosphorus. Therefore, the fraction of dietary phosphate absorbed from the diet needs to be reduced by using phosphate binders in most renal failure patients on maintenance dialysis. Calcium acetate when taken with meals combines with dietary phosphate to form insoluble calcium phosphate which is excreted in the feces. Maintenance of serum phosphorus below 6.0 mg/dl is generally considered as a clinically acceptable outcome of treatment with phosphate binders. Calcium acetate is highly soluble at neutral pH, making the calcium readily available for binding to phosphate in the proximal small intestine.Calcium acetate and other calcium salts are phosphate binders. They work by binding with the phosphate in the food you eat, so that it is eliminated from the body without being absorbed."
109,"For the treatment of vulvovaginitis caused by Candida albicans.Sulfanilamide is a molecule containing the sulfonamide functional group attached to an aniline.Sulfanilamide is a sulfonamide antibiotic. The sulfonamides are synthetic bacteriostatic antibiotics with a wide spectrum against most gram-positive and many gram-negative organisms. However, many strains of an individual species may be resistant. Sulfonamides inhibit multiplication of bacteria by acting as competitive inhibitors of p-aminobenzoic acid in the folic acid metabolism cycle. Bacterial sensitivity is the same for the various sulfonamides, and resistance to one sulfonamide indicates resistance to all. Most sulfonamides are readily absorbed orally. However, parenteral administration is difficult, since the soluble sulfonamide salts are highly alkaline and irritating to the tissues. The sulfonamides are widely distributed throughout all tissues. High levels are achieved in pleural, peritoneal, synovial, and ocular fluids. Although these drugs are no longer used to treat meningitis, CSF levels are high in meningeal infections. Their antibacterial action is inhibited by pus.Sulfanilamide is a competitive inhibitor of bacterial enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase. This enzyme normally uses para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) for synthesizing the necessary folic acid. The inhibited reaction is normally necessary in these organisms for the synthesis of folic acid. Without it, bacteria cannot replicate."
110,"Anagrelide is indicated for the treatment of thrombocythemia, secondary to malignant neoplasms, to reduce platelet count and the associated risk of thrombosis. It is also beneficial in the amelioration of thrombocythemia symptoms including thrombo-hemorrhagic events.[L14153]Anagrelide is a platelet-reducing agent used to lower dangerously elevated platelet levels (i.e. to treat thrombocythemia) in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms.[L14153] It is an oral imidazoquinazoline that was first approved for use in the US in 1997.[A214274] It appears to carry a better response rate than other thrombocythemia treatments (e.g. [busulfan], [hydroxyurea]) and may be better tolerated.[A214274]Anagrelide decreases platelet counts by suppressing transcription factors necessary for the synthesis and maturation of platelet-producing cells.[L14153] The drug itself appears to have a relatively short residence time in the body necessitating twice or four times daily dosing. However, given that the pharmacological effect of anagrelide therapy is reliant on a gradual suppression of platelet-producing cells, it may take 7 to 14 days[L14300] for its administration to be reflected in reduced platelet counts - for this reason any changes to anagrelide doses should not exceed 0.5 mg/day in any one week.[L14153]    Evidence from animal studies suggests anagrelide may impair female fertility.[L14153] Female patients of reproductive age should be advised of the potential for adverse effects on fertility prior to initiating therapy.The exact mechanism by which anagrelide lowers platelet count is unclear. Evidence from human trials suggests a dose-related suppression of megakaryocyte maturation, the cells responsible for platelet production - blood drawn from patients receiving anagrelide showed a disruption to the post-mitotic phase of megakaryocyte development and a subsequent reduction in their size and ploidy.[L14300] This may be achieved via indirect suppression of certain transcription factors required for megakaryocytopoeisis, including GATA-1 and FOG-1.[L14153]    Anagrelide is a known inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 3A (PDE3A), although its platelet-lowering effects appear unrelated to this inhibition.[A204317] While PDE3 inhibitors, as a class, can inhibit platelet aggregation, this effect is only seen at higher anagrelide doses (i.e. greater than those required to reduce platelet count).[L14153] Modulation of PDE3A has been implicated in causing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells expressing both PDE3A and SLFN12,[A204167] and may be of value in the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumours.[A204314]"
111,"For the treatment of brain tumors, multiple myeloma, Hodgkin's disease and Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.A cell-cycle phase nonspecific alkylating antineoplastic agent. It is used in the treatment of brain tumors and various other malignant neoplasms. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p462) This substance may reasonably be anticipated to be a carcinogen according to the Fourth Annual Report on Carcinogens (NTP 85-002, 1985). (From Merck Index, 11th ed)Carmustine is one of the nitrosoureas indicated as palliative therapy as a single agent or in established combination therapy with other approved chemotherapeutic agents in treatment of brain tumors, multiple myeloma, Hodgkin's disease, and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Although it is generally agreed that carmustine alkylates DNA and RNA, it is not cross resistant with other alkylators. As with other nitrosoureas, it may also inhibit several key enzymatic processes by carbamoylation of amino acids in proteins.Carmustine causes cross-links in DNA and RNA, leading to the inhibition of DNA synthesis, RNA production and RNA translation (protein synthesis). Carmustine also binds to and modifies (carbamoylates) glutathione reductase. This leads to cell death."
112,"For the treatment of severe, repeated, or long-lasting urinary tract infections, meningococcal meningitis, acute otitis media, trachoma, inclusion conjunctivitis, nocardiosis, chancroid, toxoplasmosis, malaria and other bacterial infections.A short-acting sulfonamide antibacterial with activity against a wide range of gram- negative and gram-positive organisms.Sulfisoxazole is a sulfonamide antibiotic.

113,"Metoprolol is indicated for the treatment of angina, heart failure, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter and hypertension.[A175141,L36065,L45553]    Some off-label uses of metoprolol include supraventricular tachycardia and thyroid storm.[A175141]    All the indications of metoprolol are part of cardiovascular diseases. These conditions correspond to a number of diseases that involve the function of the heart and blood vessels. The underlying causes of these conditions are variable and can be due to genetic disposition, lifestyle decisions such as smoking, obesity, diet, and lack of exercise, and comorbidity with other conditions such as diabetes. The cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death on a global scale.[L5533]Metoprolol is a selective beta-1 blocker commonly employed as the succinate and tartrate derivatives depending if the formulation is designed to be of immediate release or extended release.[A175159, L5530] The possibility of the generation of these formulations comes from the lower systemic bioavailability of the succinate derivative.[T274] To this date, it is one of the preferred beta-blockers in general clinical guidelines and it is widely prescribed in the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the US.[A175162] Metoprolol was developed since 1969 by US Pharmaceutical Holdings I and FDA approved in 1978.[L5527]Administration of metoprolol in normal subjects is widely reported to produce a dose-dependent reduction on heart rate and cardiac output.[A175141] This effect is generated due to a decreased cardiac excitability, cardiac output, and myocardial oxygen demand.[T76] In the case of arrhythmias, metoprolol produces its effect by reducing the slope of the pacemaker potential as well as suppressing the rate of atrioventricular conduction.[T451]    The Metoprolol Atherosclerosis Prevention in Hypertensives (MAPHY) trial showed a significant improvement in sudden cardiac death and myocardial infarction when patients were given with metoprolol as compared with diuretics. As well, in clinical trials performed in 1990, metoprolol reduces mortality and re-infarction in 17% of the individuals when administered chronically after an episode of myocardial infarction.[A175141]Metoprolol is a beta-1-adrenergic receptor inhibitor specific to cardiac cells with negligible effect on beta-2 receptors. This inhibition decreases cardiac output by producing negative chronotropic and inotropic effects without presenting activity towards membrane stabilization nor intrinsic sympathomimetics.[A175141]"
114,"Dicoumarol is an oral anticoagulant agent that works by interfering with the metabolism of vitamin K. In addition to its clinical use, it is also used in biochemical experiments as an inhibitor of reductases.Dicumarol is an coumarin-like compound found in sweet clover. It is used as an oral anticoagulant and acts by inhibiting the hepatic synthesis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors (prothrombin and factors VII, IX, and X). Dicumarol inhibits vitamin K reductase, resulting in depletion of the reduced form of vitamin K (vitamin KH2). As vitamin K is a cofactor for the carboxylation of glutamate residues on the N-terminal regions of vitamin K-dependent proteins, this limits the gamma-carboxylation and subsequent activation of the vitamin K-dependent coagulant proteins. The synthesis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X and anticoagulant proteins C and S is inhibited. Depression of three of the four vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors (factors II, VII, and X) results in decresed prothrombin levels and a decrease in the amount of thrombin generated and bound to fibrin. This reduces the thrombogenicity of clots."
115,"Used to treat female gynecologic and obstetric infections caused by susceptible aerobic (including the gonococcus) and anaerobic bacteria.Cefmenoxime is a novel broad-spectrum and third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic that is typically used in the treatment of female gynecologic and obstetric infections. It is reported to exhibit high activity against a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.Cefmenoxime is a semisynthetic beta-lactam cephalosporin antibiotic with activity similar to that of cefotaxime. It has broad spectrum activity against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria.The bactericidal activity of cefmenoxime results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Cefmenoxime is stable in the presence of a variety of b-lactamases, including penicillinases and some cephalosporinases."
116,"For the treatment of the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease and for the treatment of primary moderate-severe restless legs syndrome [FDA label].Ropinirole, also known as _ReQuip_, is a non-ergoline dopamine agonist used in Parkinson's disease and restless legs syndrome [FDA label], [A174547]. It is manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals.   Ropinirole was initially approved in 1997 by the FDA [FDA label] for the management of Parkinson's disease. In 2005, it was the first drug approved in the US for the management of primary moderate to severe restless legs syndrome [A174547].     In 2008, the extended-release capsules of ropinirole were approved, allowing for less frequent dosing, therefore increased compliance, and offering a similar side effect profile and efficacy to previous formulations of ropinirole [A35711].**Effects on Parkinson's and restless leg syndrome**    This drug promotes the relief or improvement of symptoms of Parkinson's or restless leg syndrome by stimulatory actions on dopamine receptors, which regulate movement.    **Effects on blood pressure**    Clinical experience with dopamine agonists, including ropinirole, suggests an association with impaired abilities in regulating blood pressure with resulting orthostatic hypotension, especially with patients undergoing dose escalation. In some patients in clinical studies, blood pressure changes were associated with orthostatic symptoms, bradycardia, and, in one case in a healthy volunteer, transient sinus arrest accompanied by syncope [FDA label]. The mechanism of orthostatic hypotension caused by ropinirole is assumed to be due to a D2-mediated blunting of noradrenergic response to a standing position, followed by a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance. Nausea is also a frequent symptom which accompanies orthostatic signs and symptoms [FDA label].    **Effects on prolactin**    At oral doses as low as 0.2 mg, ropinirole suppressed serum prolactin concentrations in healthy male volunteers.  Ropinirole had no dose-related effect on ECG wave form and rhythm in young, healthy, male volunteers in the range of 0.01 to 2.5 mg [FDA label].    **Effects on QT interval**    Ropinirole had no dose- or exposure-related effect on average QT intervals in healthy male and female volunteers at doses up to 4 mg/day. The effect of ropinirole on QTc intervals at higher exposures reached either due to drug interactions, hepatic dysfunction, or at higher doses has not been adequately evaluated [FDA label]. Ropinirole is a non-ergoline dopamine agonist. Ropinirole has the highest affinity at the D3 receptors, which are concentrated in the limbic areas of the brain and may be responsible for some of the neuropsychiatric effects [A35711]. The exact mechanism of action of ropinirole as a treatment for Parkinson’s disease is unknown, however, it is believed to be related to its ability to selectively stimulate dopamine D2 receptors within the caudate-putamen system in the brain.  This system affects body movement.  Negligible affinity is seen for ropinirole at α2 adrenoreceptors in the periphery and 5HT-1 receptor. Ropinirole has no affinity at the D1-like receptors, benzodiazepine or GABA receptors [A35711].       The precise mechanism of action of ropinirole as a treatment for Restless Legs Syndrome is unknown, however, it is believed to be related to its ability to stimulate dopamine receptors [FDA label]."
117,"Used to treat symptoms of menopause, deficiencies in ovary function (including underdevelopment of female sexual characteristics and some types of infertility), and in rare cases, prostate cancer. Chlorotrianisene may also be used to prevent breast engorgement following childbirth.A powerful synthetic, non-steroidal estrogen. [PubChem]Chlorotrianisene is a nonsteroidal synthetic estrogen. After menopause, when the body no longer produces estrogen, chlorotrianisene is used as a simple replacement of estrogen. The estrogen-stimulated endometrium may bleed within 48-72 hours after discontinuance of estrogen therapy. Paradoxically, prolonged estrogen therapy may cause shrinkage of the endometrium and an increase in size of the myometrium. Estrogens have a weak anabolic effect and may cause sodium retention with associated fluid retention and edema. Estrogens may also decrease elevated blood cholesterol and phospholipid concentrations. Estrogens affect bone by increasing calcium deposition and accelerating epiphyseal closure, following initial growth stimulation. During the preovulatory or nonovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle, estrogen is the principal determinant in the onset of menstruation. A decline of estrogenic activity at the end of the menstrual cycle also may induce menstruation; however, the cessation of progesterone secretion is the most important factor during the mature ovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle. The benefit derived from estrogen therapy in the prevention of postpartum breast engorgement must be carefully weighed against the potential&nbsp;increased risk of puerperal thromboembolism&nbsp;associated with the use of large doses of estrogens.Chlorotrianisene binds to the estrogen receptor on various estrogen receptor bearing cells. Target cells include cells in the female reproductive tract, the mammary gland, the hypothalamus, and the pituitary. Estrogens increase the hepatic synthesis of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), thyroid-binding globulin (TBG), and other serum proteins and suppress follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary."
118,"For the management of mild to moderate essential hypertension.Isradipine belongs to the dihydropyridine (DHP) class of calcium channel blockers (CCBs), the most widely used class of CCBs. It is structurally related to felodipine, nifedipine, and nimodipine and is the most potent calcium-channel blocking agent of the DHP class. Isradipine binds to calcium channels with high affinity and specificity and inhibits calcium flux into cardiac and arterial smooth muscle cells. It exhibits greater selectivity towards arterial smooth muscle cells owing to alternative splicing of the alpha-1 subunit of the channel and increased prevalence of inactive channels in smooth muscle cells. Isradipine may be used to treat mild to moderate essential hypertension.Isradipine decreases arterial smooth muscle contractility and subsequent vasoconstriction by inhibiting the influx of calcium ions through L-type calcium channels. Calcium ions entering the cell through these channels bind to calmodulin. Calcium-bound calmodulin then binds to and activates myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). Activated MLCK catalyzes the phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain subunit of myosin, a key step in muscle contraction. Signal amplification is achieved by calcium-induced calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through ryanodine receptors. Inhibition of the initial influx of calcium decreases the contractile activity of arterial smooth muscle cells and results in vasodilation. The vasodilatory effects of isradipine result in an overall decrease in blood pressure. Isradipine belongs to the dihydropyridine (DHP) class of calcium channel blockers (CCBs), the most widely used class of CCBs. There are at least five different types of calcium channels in Homo sapiens: L-, N-, P/Q-, R- and T-type. CCBs target L-type calcium channels, the major channel in muscle cells that mediates contraction. Similar to other DHP CCBs, isradipine binds directly to inactive calcium channels stabilizing their inactive conformation. Since arterial smooth muscle depolarizations are longer in duration than cardiac muscle depolarizations, inactive channels are more prevalent in smooth muscle cells. Alternative splicing of the alpha-1 subunit of the channel gives isradipine additional arterial selectivity. At therapeutic sub-toxic concentrations, isradipine has little effect on cardiac myocytes and conduction cells."
119,"Used, alone or in combination, for a wide variety of diagnostic imaging methods, including angiography, urography, cholangiography, computed tomography, hysterosalpingography, and retrograde pyelography. It can be used for imaging the gastrointestinal tract in patients allergic to barium.A commonly used x-ray contrast medium.  As diatrizoate meglumine and as Diatrizoate sodium, it is used for gastrointestinal studies, angiography, and urography.Diatrizoate is the most commonly used water-soluble, iodinated, radiopaque x-ray contrast medium. Radiopaque agents are drugs used to help diagnose certain medical problems. They contain iodine, which blocks x-rays. Depending on how the radiopaque agent is given, it localizes or builds up in certain areas of the body. The resulting high level of iodine allows the x-rays to make a ""picture"" of the area. The areas of the body in which the radiopaque agent localizes will appear white on the x-ray film. This creates the needed distinction, or contrast, between one organ and other tissues. The contrast will help the doctor see any special conditions that may exist in that organ or part of the body.Diatrizoate is an iodine-containing X-ray contrast agent.  Iodated contrast agents were among the first contrast agents developed.  Iodine is known to be particular electron-dense and to effectively scatter or stop X-rays. A good contrast agent requires a high density of electron-dense atoms. Therefore, the more iodine, the more ""dense"" the x-ray effect.  Iodine based contrast media are water soluble and harmless to the body. These contrast agents are sold as clear colorless water solutions, the concentration is usually expressed as mg I/ml. Modern iodinated contrast agents can be used almost anywhere in the body. Most often they are used intravenously, but for various purposes they can also be used intraarterially, intrathecally (the spine) and intraabdominally - just about any body cavity or potential space."
120,"Topiramate is indicated  for the following conditions: 1)Monotherapy for partial onset or primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures for patients 2 years of age and above 2)Adjunctive therapy for partial onset seizures or primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures for both adult and pediatric patients above 2 years old 3)Adjunctive therapy for seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in patients above 2 years of age 4)Prophylaxis of migraine in children 12 years of age and older and adults.[L10544]    Topiramate is also used off-label as an adjunct therapy for weight management[L10550] and for mood disorders.[A188312]Topiramate is a anti-epileptic drug used to manage seizures and prevent migraines.[A175249] It was initially approved by the FDA in 1996. In 2004, topiramate was approved for the prevention of migraine in adults.[L10550]     Characteristics that distinguish topiramate from other antiepileptic drugs are a monosaccharide chemical structure containing a sulfamate, and 40% of its mass accounted for by oxygen.[A175249] Interestingly, topiramate was discovered by chance when attempts were made to formulate a novel antidiabetic drug.[A188330]Topiramate prevents the occurrence of seizures and prevents migraine symptoms by reducing neural pathway excitability.[A188330,L10544] It is important to note that this drug may cause metabolic acidosis, mood changes, suicidal thoughts and attempts, as well as kidney stones. [L10544]A seizure is an abnormal and unregulated electrical discharge occurring in the brain. This leads to transient interruption in brain function, manifested by reduced alertness, abnormal sensations, and focal involuntary movements or convulsions. Several types of seizures exist, with common types including tonic-clonic seizures and partial onset seizures.[L5548]    The exact mechanisms by which topiramate exerts pharmacological actions on seizures and migraines are currently not fully characterized.[A188336,L10544]  Several properties of this drug, however, are likely to contribute to its therapeutic effects. Topiramate has been observed to exert actions on voltage-dependent sodium channels, GABA receptors, and glutamate receptors.[A175249,L10544]     Topiramate stimulates GABA-A receptor activity at brain non-benzodiazepine receptor sites and reduces glutamate activity at both AMPA and kainate receptors. Normally, GABA-A receptors are inhibitory and glutaminergic receptors are stimulatory for neuronal activity.[A175243,T752] By increasing GABA activity and inhibiting glutamate activity, topiramate blocks neuronal excitability, preventing seizures and migraines.[A188333,A188309,L10544] Additionally, it blocks the voltage-dependent sodium channels, further blocking seizure activity.[A175243] Topiramate has been shown to inhibit various carbonic anhydrase isozymes, but the clinical significance of this is unknown at this time.[A10342,A10348,A20066,L10544]    "
121,"For the treatment of infections caused by susceptible organisms.A semisynthetic cephamycin antibiotic with a broad spectrum of activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. It has a high rate of efficacy in many types of infection and to date no severe side effects have been noted.Cefmetazole is a second-generation cephalosporin. The cephalosporins are bactericidal drugs with both gram-positive and gram-negative activity. They inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis in a way similar to the penicillins. Cefmetazole is more active than 1st-generation cephalosporins against indole-positive Proteus,Serratia, anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (including B. fragilis), and some E. coli, Klebsiella, and P. mirabilis, but is less active than cefoxitin or cefotetan against most gram-negative bacilli.The bactericidal activity of cefmetazole results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs)."
122,"[F4709,F4712,A173869]     Olmesartan is also used off-label for the management Type 2 Diabetes-associated nephropathy, heart failure, and post-myocardial infarction, particularly in patients who are unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors.[A178153,A185912,A185915] ARBs such as olmesartan have been shown in a number of large-scale clinical outcomes trials to improve cardiovascular outcomes including reducing risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, the progression of heart failure, and hospitalization.[A174124,A178153,A173869,A185324,A185327,A185333,A185342,A185345] Like other ARBs, olmesartan blockade of RAAS slows the progression of diabetic nephropathy due to its renoprotective effects.[A185906,A185909,A185912] Olmesartan belongs to the angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) family of drugs, which also includes [telmisartan], [candesartan], [losartan], [valsartan], and [irbesartan]. ARBs selectively bind to angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1) and prevent the protein angiotensin II from binding and exerting its hypertensive effects, which include vasoconstriction, stimulation and synthesis of aldosterone and ADH, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium, among others. Overall, olmesartan's physiologic effects lead to reduced blood pressure, lower aldosterone levels, reduced cardiac activity, and increased excretion of sodium.     Olmesartan also affects the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), which plays an important role in hemostasis and regulation of kidney, vascular, and cardiac functions. Pharmacological blockade of RAAS via  AT1 receptor blockade inhibits negative regulatory feedback within RAAS, which is a contributing factor to the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and renal disease. In particular, heart failure is associated with chronic activation of RAAS, leading to inappropriate fluid retention, vasoconstriction, and ultimately a further decline in left ventricular function. ARBs have been shown to have a protective effect on the heart by improving cardiac function, reducing afterload, increasing cardiac output and preventing ventricular hypertrophy and remodelling.[A174154]     By comparison, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) class of medications (which includes drugs such as [ramipril], [lisinopril], and [perindopril]) inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II through inhibition of the ACE enzyme. However, this does not prevent the formation of all angiotensin II within the body. The angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) family of drugs unique in that it blocks all angiotensin II activity, regardless of where or how it was synthesized.     Olmesartan is commonly used for the management of hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes-associated nephropathy, particularly in patients who are unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors. ARBs such as olmesartan have been shown in a number of large-scale clinical outcomes trials to improve cardiovascular outcomes including reducing risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, the progression of heart failure, and hospitalization.[A174124,A178153,A173869,A185324,A185327,A185333,A185342,A185345] Like other ARBs, olmesartan blockade of RAAS slows the progression of diabetic nephropathy due to its renoprotective effects.[A185906,A185909,A185912]     Orally available olmesartan is produced as the prodrug olmesartan medoxomil which is rapidly converted _in vivo_ to the pharmacologically active olmesartan.[A175330] It was developed by Daiichi Sankyo Pharmaceuticals and approved in 2002.[A175345, L12882]Overall, olmesartan's physiologic effects lead to reduced blood pressure, lower aldosterone levels, reduced cardiac activity, and increased excretion of sodium.       **Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients**    In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, such as volume-and/or salt-depleted patients (e.g., those being treated with high doses of diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may be anticipated after initiation of treatment with olmesartan. Initiate treatment under close medical supervision. If hypotension does occur, place the patient in the supine position and, if necessary, give an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized.[F4709,F4712]    Valvular Stenosis: there is concern on theoretical grounds that patients with aortic stenosis might be at a particular risk of decreased coronary perfusion, because they do not develop as much afterload reduction.[F4712]      **Impaired Renal Function**    As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with olmesartan. In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system (e.g., patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and rarely with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar results may be anticipated in patients treated with olmesartan.    In studies of ACE inhibitors in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen (BUN) have been reported. There has been no long-term use of olmesartan medoxomil in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but similar results may be expected.[F4709,F4712]      **Sprue-like Enteropathy**    Severe, chronic diarrhea with substantial weight loss has been reported in patients taking olmesartan months to years after drug initiation. Intestinal biopsies of patients often demonstrated villous atrophy. If a patient develops these symptoms during treatment with olmesartan, exclude other etiologies. Consider discontinuation of olmesartan medoxomil in cases where no other etiology is identified.[F4709,F4712]      **Electrolyte Imbalances**    Olmesartan medoxomil contains olmesartan, a drug that inhibits the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Drugs that inhibit the RAS can cause hyperkalemia. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically.[F4709,F4712]Olmesartan belongs to the angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) family of drugs, which also includes [telmisartan], [candesartan], [losartan], [valsartan], and [irbesartan]. ARBs selectively bind to angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1) and prevent the protein angiotensin II from binding and exerting its hypertensive effects. As the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, Angiotensin II causes vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis.[F4709] Overall, olmesartan's physiologic effects lead to reduced blood pressure, lower aldosterone levels, reduced cardiac activity, and increased excretion of sodium.     Olmesartan also effects on the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) plays an important role in hemostasis and regulation of kidney, vascular, and cardiac functions.

Rapidly dividing cells are two to four times more sensitive to amsacrine than are resting cells. Amsacrine appears to cleave DNA by inducing double stranded breaks. Amsacrine also targets and inhibits topoisomerase II. Cytotoxicity is greatest during the S phase of the cell cycle when topoisomerase levels are at a maximum."
124,"For the treatment of the symptoms and reversible airflow obstruction associated with chronic asthma and other chronic lung diseases, such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis.A methylxanthine derivative from tea with diuretic, smooth muscle relaxant, bronchial dilation, cardiac and central nervous system stimulant activities. Mechanistically, theophylline acts as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, adenosine receptor blocker, and histone deacetylase activator. Theophylline is marketed under several brand names such as Uniphyl and Theochron, and it is indicated mainly for asthma, bronchospasm, and COPD.Theophylline, an xanthine derivative chemically similar to caffeine and theobromine, is used to treat asthma and bronchospasm. Theophylline has two distinct actions in the airways of patients with reversible (asthmatic) obstruction; smooth muscle relaxation (i.e., bronchodilation) and suppression of the response of the airways to stimuli (i.e., non-bronchodilator prophylactic effects).Theophylline relaxes the smooth muscle of the bronchial airways and pulmonary blood vessels and reduces airway responsiveness to histamine, methacholine, adenosine, and allergen. Theophylline competitively inhibits type III and type IV phosphodiesterase (PDE), the enzyme responsible for breaking down cyclic AMP in smooth muscle cells, possibly resulting in bronchodilation. Theophylline also binds to the adenosine A2B receptor and blocks adenosine mediated bronchoconstriction. In inflammatory states, theophylline activates histone deacetylase to prevent transcription of inflammatory genes that require the acetylation of histones for transcription to begin."
125,"For the treatment of documented ventricular arrhythmias, such as sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular pre-excitation and cardiac dysrhythmias. It is a Class Ia antiarrhythmic drug.A class I anti-arrhythmic agent (one that interferes directly with the depolarization of the cardiac membrane and thus serves as a membrane-stabilizing agent) with a depressant action on the heart similar to that of guanidine. It also possesses some anticholinergic and local anesthetic properties.Disopyramide is an anti-arrhythmic drug indicated for the treatment of documented ventricular arrhythmias, such as sustained ventricular tachycardia that are life-threatening. At therapeutic plasma levels, disopyramide shortens the sinus node recovery time, lengthens the effective refractory period of the atrium, and has a minimal effect on the effective refractory period of the AV node. Little effect has been shown on AV-nodal and His-Purkinje conduction times or QRS duration. However, prolongation of conduction in accessory pathways occurs.Disopyramide is a Type 1A antiarrhythmic drug (ie, similar to procainamide and quinidine). It inhibits the fast sodium channels. In animal studies Disopyramide decreases the rate of diastolic depolarization (phase 4) in cells with augmented automaticity, decreases the upstroke velocity (phase 0) and increases the action potential duration of normal cardiac cells, decreases the disparity in refractoriness between infarcted and adjacent normally perfused myocardium, and has no effect on alpha- or beta-adrenergic receptors."
126,"Lidocaine is an anesthetic of the amide group indicated for production of local or regional anesthesia by infiltration techniques such as percutaneous injection and intravenous regional anesthesia by peripheral nerve block techniques such as brachial plexus and intercostal and by central neural techniques such as lumbar and caudal epidural blocks [F4349, L5930].Ever since its discovery and availability for sale and use in the late 1940s, lidocaine has become an exceptionally commonly used medication [T583]. In particular, lidocaine's principal mode of action in acting as a local anesthetic that numbs the sensations of tissues means the agent is indicated for facilitating local anesthesia for a large variety of surgical procedures [F4349, L5930, L5948]. It ultimately elicits its numbing activity by blocking sodium channels so that the neurons of local tissues that have the medication applied on are transiently incapable of signaling the brain regarding sensations [F4349, L5930, L5948]. In doing so, however, it can block or decrease muscle contractile, resulting in effects like vasodilation, hypotension, and irregular heart rate, among others [F4349, L5930, L5948]. As a result, lidocaine is also considered a class Ib anti-arrhythmic agent [L5930, L5948, F4468]. Nevertheless, lidocaine's local anesthetic action sees its use in many medical situations or circumstances that may benefit from its action, including the treatment of premature ejaculation [A177625].    Regardless, lidocaine is currently available as a relatively non-expensive generic medication that is written for in millions of prescriptions internationally on a yearly basis. It is even included in the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines [L6055].Excessive blood levels of lidocaine can cause changes in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure [F4349, L5930]. With central neural blockade these changes may be attributable to the block of autonomic fibers, a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system, and/or the beta-adrenergic receptor stimulating action of epinephrine when present [F4349, L5930]. The net effect is normally a modest hypotension when the recommended dosages are not exceeded [F4349, L5930].    In particular, such cardiac effects are likely associated with the principal effect that lidocaine elicits when it binds and blocks sodium channels, inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of electrical action potential impulses necessary to facilitate muscle contraction [F4349, L5930, L5948]. Subsequently, in cardiac myocytes, lidocaine can potentially block or otherwise slow the rise of cardiac action potentials and their associated cardiac myocyte contractions, resulting in possible effects like hypotension, bradycardia, myocardial depression, cardiac arrhythmias, and perhaps cardiac arrest or circulatory collapse [F4349, L5930, L5948].    Moreover, lidocaine possesses a dissociation constant (pKa) of 7.7 and is considered a weak base [L5948]. As a result, about 25% of lidocaine molecules will be un-ionized and available at the physiological pH of 7.4 to translocate inside nerve cells, which means lidocaine elicits an onset of action more rapidly than other local anesthetics that have higher pKa values [L5948]. This rapid onset of action is demonstrated in about one minute following intravenous injection and fifteen minutes following intramuscular injection [L5930]. The administered lidocaine subsequently spreads rapidly through the surrounding tissues and the anesthetic effect lasts approximately ten to twenty minutes when given intravenously and about sixty to ninety minutes after intramuscular injection [L5930].    Nevertheless, it appears that the efficacy of lidocaine may be minimized in the presence of inflammation [L5948]. This effect could be due to acidosis decreasing the amount of un-ionized lidocaine molecules, a more rapid reduction in lidocaine concentration as a result of increased blood flow, or potentially also because of increased production of inflammatory mediators like peroxynitrite that elicit direct actions on sodium channels [L5948].Lidocaine is a local anesthetic of the amide type [F4349, L5930, L5948]. It is used to provide local anesthesia by nerve blockade at various sites in the body [F4349, L5930, L5948]. It does so by stabilizing the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action [F4349, L5930, L5948]. In particular, the lidocaine agent acts on sodium ion channels located on the internal surface of nerve cell membranes [F4349, L5930, L5948]. At these channels, neutral uncharged lidocaine molecules diffuse through neural sheaths into the axoplasm where they are subsequently ionized by joining with hydrogen ions [F4349, L5930, L5948]. The resultant lidocaine cations are then capable of reversibly binding the sodium channels from the inside, keeping them locked in an open state that prevents nerve depolarization [F4349, L5930, L5948]. As a result, with sufficient blockage, the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron will ultimately not depolarize and will thus fail to transmit an action potential [F4349, L5930, L5948]. This facilitates an anesthetic effect by not merely preventing pain signals from propagating to the brain but by aborting their generation in the first place [F4349, L5930, L5948].    In addition to blocking conduction in nerve axons in the peripheral nervous system, lidocaine has important effects on the central nervous system and cardiovascular system [F4349, L5930, L5948]. After absorption, lidocaine may cause stimulation of the CNS followed by depression and in the cardiovascular system, it acts primarily on the myocardium where it may produce decreases in electrical excitability, conduction rate, and force of contraction [F4349, L5930, L5948]."

Bone resorption by osteoclasts causes local acidification, releasing the bisphosphonate, which is taken into the osteoclast by fluid-phase endocytosis.[A959] Endocytic vesicles become acidified, releasing bisphosphonates into the cytosol of osteoclasts where they act.[A959]    Osteoclasts mediate resorption of bone.[A6366] When osteoclasts bind to bone they form podosomes, ring structures of F-actin.[A6366] Disruption of the podosomes causes osteoclasts to detach from bones, preventing bone resorption.[A6366]    Nitrogen containing bisphosphonates such as pamidronate are known to induce apoptosis of hematopoietic tumor cells by inhibiting the components of the mevalonate pathway farnesyl diphosphate synthase, farnesyl diphosphate, and geranylgeranyl diphosphate.[A202769,A203123,A203111] These components are essential for post-translational prenylation of GTP-binding proteins like Rap1.[A202769,A203123] The lack of prenylation of these proteins interferes with their function, and in the case of Rap1, leads to apoptosis.[A202769,A203123] pamidronate also activated caspases 3 and 9 which further contribute to apoptosis.[A202769,A203123,A203177]"

Also for the management of mild, uncomplicated allergic skin manifestations of urticaria and angioedema. Used as self-medication for temporary relief of symptoms associated with the common cold.An ethanolamine-derivative, first generation histamine H1 antagonist used in hay fever, rhinitis, allergic skin conditions, and pruritus. It causes drowsiness.Clemastine is an antihistamine that also induces anticholinergic and sedative effects. Antihistamines competitively antagonize various physiological effects of histamine including increased capillary permeability and dilatation, the formation of edema, the ""flare"" and ""itch"" response, and gastrointestinal and respiratory smooth muscle constriction. Within the vascular tree, H1- receptor antagonists inhibit both the vasoconstrictor and vasodilator effects of histamine. Depending on the dose, H1- receptor antagonists can produce CNS stimulation or depression. Most antihistamines exhibit central and/or peripheral anticholinergic activity. Antihistamines act by competitively blocking H1- receptor sites. Antihistamines do not pharmacologically antagonize or chemically inactivate histamine, nor do they prevent the release of histamine.Clemastine is a selective histamine H1 antagonist and binds to the histamine H1 receptor. This blocks the action of endogenous histamine, which subsequently leads to temporary relief of the negative symptoms brought on by histamine."
129,"Acarbose is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.[L31628]Acarbose is a complex oligosaccharide that acts as an inhibitor of several enzymes responsible for the breakdown of complex carbohydrates in the intestines. It inhibits both pancreatic alpha-amylase and membrane-bound alpha-glucosidases - including intestinal glucoamylase, sucrase, maltase, and isomaltase - which are responsible for the metabolism of complex starches and oligo-, tri-, and disaccharides into absorbable simple sugars.[L31633,A37868] By inhibiting the activity of these enzymes, acarbose limits the absorption of dietary carbohydrates and the subsequent postprandial increase in blood glucose and insulin levels. Acarbose is therefore used in conjunction with diet, exercise, and other pharmacotherapies for the management of blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes.[L31628,L31633]    Acarbose is one of only two approved alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (the other being [miglitol]), receiving its first FDA approval in 1995 under the brand name Precose (since discontinued).[L31668] This class of antidiabetic therapy is not widely used due to their relatively modest impact on A1c, their requirement for thrice-daily dosing, and the potential for significant gastrointestinal adverse effects.[L31668]Acarbose is a complex oligosaccharide that competitively inhibits the ability of brush-border alpha-glucosidase enzymes to break down ingested carbohydrates into absorbable monosaccharides, reducing carbohydrate absorption and subsequent postprandial insulin levels.[A37868] Acarbose requires the co-administration of carbohydrates in order to exert its therapeutic effect, and as such should be taken with the first bite of a meal three times daily[L31633] Patients maintained on acarbose in addition to other antidiabetic agents should be aware of the symptoms and risks of hypoglycemia and how to treat hypoglycemic episodes. There have been rare post-marketing reports of the development of pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis following treatment with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors - patients experiencing significant diarrhea/constipation, mucus discharge, and/or rectal bleeding should be investigated and, if pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis is suspected, should discontinue therapy.[L31628]Alpha-glucosidase enzymes are located in the brush-border of the intestinal mucosa and serve to metabolize oligo-, tri-, and disaccharides (e.g. sucrose) into smaller monosaccharides (e.g. glucose, fructose) which are more readily absorbed.[A37868] These work in conjunction with pancreatic alpha-amylase, an enzyme found in the intestinal lumen that hydrolyzes complex starches to oligosaccharides.[L31633]    Acarbose is a complex oligosaccharide that competitively and reversibly inhibits both pancreatic alpha-amylase and membrane-bound alpha-glucosidases - of the alpha-glucosidases, inhibitory potency appears to follow a rank order of glucoamylase > sucrase > maltase > isomaltase.[L31633] By preventing the metabolism and subsequent absorption of dietary carbohydrates, acarbose reduces postprandial blood glucose and insulin levels."
130,"Venlafaxine is indicated for the management of major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), and panic disorder.[L43030]Venlafaxine is an antidepressant and a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). Its active metabolite, [desvenlafaxine], works by blocking the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, which are key neurotransmitters in mood regulation. Venlafaxine is officially approved to treat major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder in adults.[L43030] The immediate formulation of the drug, marketed as Effexor, was first approved by the FDA in 1993 and the extended-release formulation, Effexor XR, was later introduced in 1997.[A252065]    Venlafaxine has been used as a first-line treatment for MDD, GAD, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder in Canada for many years. It was also considered a second-line treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).[A177226,A177235] Venlafaxine was also investigated in off-label uses for the prophylaxis of migraine headaches,[A413,A177229] for reduction of vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause,[A177238] and for the management of neuropathic pain (although there is only minimal evidence of efficacy for this condition).[A177232]Venlafaxine is an antidepressant agent that works to ameliorate the symptoms of various psychiatric disorders by increasing the level of neurotransmitters in the synapse. Venlafaxine does not mediate muscarinic, histaminergic, or adrenergic effects.[L43030]The exact mechanism of action of venlafaxine in the treatment of various psychiatric conditions has not been fully elucidated; however, it is understood that venlafaxine and its active metabolite O-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV) potently and selectively inhibits the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine at the presynaptic terminal.[A27600,A252065,L43030] This results in increased levels of neurotransmitters available at the synapse that can stimulate postsynaptic receptors.[A252075] It is suggested that venlafaxine has a 30-fold selectivity for serotonin compared to norepinephrine: venlafaxine initially inhibits serotonin reuptake at low doses, and with higher doses, it inhibits norepinephrine reuptake in addition to serotonin.[A252065,A252070] Venlafaxine and ODV are also weak inhibitors of dopamine reuptake.[L43030]"
131,"The conjugated estrogens are indicated for several different conditions including:    - Treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms due to menopause.  - Treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy due to menopause.  - Treatment of hypoestrogenism due to hypogonadism, castration or primary ovarian failure.  - Palliative treatment of breast cancer in appropriately selected patients with metastatic disease.  - Palliative treatment of androgen-dependent carcinoma of the prostate.  - Preventive therapy of postmenopausal osteoporosis.[A38238] The conjugated estrogens are noncrystalline mixtures of purified female sex hormones obtained either by its isolation from the urine of pregnant mares or by synthetic generation from vegetal material. Both of these products are later conjugated to natrium sulfate by ester bonds in order to make them more water soluble.[L5605, T475]     The conjugated estrogen product contains a mix of estrogen from which about 50% is represented by estrone sulfate followed by 25% of equilin sulfate, 15% of 17-alpha-dehydroequilenin sulfate, 3% of equilenin sulfate, 5% of 17-alpha and 17-beta-dihydroequilenin sulfate, 2% of 17-alpha-estradiolsulfate and 3% of 17-beta-estradiolsulfate. It also presents a large number of unidentified molecules with weak estrogenic activity as well as non-human molecules when it is obtained from pregnant mares urine.[T475]     The conjugated estrogen mixture was approved for marketing in US in 1942 based on the efficacy against certain conditions. However, until 1986 official clinical trials were performed and this product was determined to be effective for the treatment of osteoporosis.[T484] The currently approved product of conjugated estrogens was developed by Wyeth Ayerst and FDA approved in 2003.[L5608]The binding of estrogens to the estrogen receptor produces the activation of nuclear receptors in order to bind to estrogen response elements in certain target genes. This mechanistic cascade results in histone acetylation, alteration of chromatin conformation and the initiation of transcription of certain specific drugs.[L5605]    In preclinical studies, the conjugated estrogens are known to have a similar estrogenic potency than estrone and the equilin components of the conjugated estrogens have similar potency in the liver when compared to bioidentical estradiol.[A35765] It has also been tested and confirmed that conjugated estrogens present a selective estrogen receptor modulator profile which allows it to have a large beneficial effect on the bone and cardiovascular system.[A175597]    Clinically, the administration of conjugated estrogens is known to promote vasomotor stability, maintain genitourinary function, and normal growth and development of female sex hormones. It has also been shown to prevent accelerated bone loss by inhibiting bone resorption and restoring the balance of bone resorption. In the hormonal area, it is shown to inhibit luteinizing hormone and decrease the serum concentration of testosterone.[T147]The conjugated estrogens, equally to the normal physiological estrogen, work by agonistically binding to the estrogen receptors alpha and beta. The estrogen receptors vary in quantity and proportion according to the tissues and hence, the activity of this conjugated estrogens is very variable.[A38238]    The activity made by the conjugated estrogens is driven by the increase in the synthesis of DNA, RNA and various proteins in responsive tissues which in order will reduce the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone and leuteinizing hormone.[T147]    The specific mechanism of action cannot be described only in terms of total estrogenic action as the pharmacokinetic profile, the tissue specificity and the tissue metabolism is different for each component of the product.[T475] "
132,"Travoprost is indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.[L49434, L49429, L49515] It is also used in pediatric patients aged two months to less than 18 years.[L5146] Travoprost is a synthetic isopropyl ester prodrug of a prostaglandin F2alpha (F2α) analogue and selective FP prostanoid receptor agonist. It is used to decrease intraocular pressure in open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension.[L49434] Unlike other prostaglandin analogues, travoprost demonstrates full agonism and high selectivity at the prostanoid receptor, reporting a higher efficacy in reducing intraocular pressure and a reduced risk for developing off-target side effects.[A262904]Travoprost demonstrates preferential affinity and full agonist activity for the prostaglandin FP receptor in the nanomolar range.[A262914] Travoprost shows no significant affinity for other prostanoid or non-prostanoid receptors.[A262904]    Travoprost-induced reduction of intraocular pressure is observed about two hours after administration, and the maximum effect is reached after 12 hours. Significant lowering of intraocular pressure can be maintained for periods exceeding 24 hours with a single dose.[L5146]Travoprost is a prodrug. Upon administration, travoprost is absorbed through the cornea and hydrolyzed to its active metabolite, travoprost free acid. The ester moiety of the free acid allows for enhanced penetration into the aqueous humour.[A262899] While the exact mechanism of travoprost is largely unknown, it is believed to be related to its full agonist activity for the prostaglandin FP receptor.[L49434] By binding to the FP receptor, travoprost free acid increases the outflow of aqueous humour via the trabecular meshwork and uveoscleral pathways, thereby reducing the intraocular pressure.[A262899, L5146, L49434]"
133,"For the relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses.Amcinonide is a corticosteroid.Amcinonide is a topical corticosteroid. The topical corticosteroids constitute a class of primarily synthetic steroids used as anti-inflammatory and antipruritic agents. Amcinonide reduces or inhibits the actions of chemicals in the body that cause inflammation, redness, and swelling. The mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity of the topical corticosteroids is unclear. Various laboratory methods, including vasoconstrictor assays, are used to compare and predict potencies and/or clinical efficacies of the topical corticosteroids. There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in man. When in an ointment form, amcinonide also helps the skin maintain moisture.The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2. Amcinonide has affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor. It has weak affinity for the progesterone receptor, and virtually no affinity for the mineralocorticoid, estrogen, or androgen receptors."
134,"Atomoxetine is indicated for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adults.Atomoxetine is a selective norepinephrine (NE) reuptake inhibitor used for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Also known as the marketed product Strattera, atomoxetine is used with other treatment modalities (psychological, educational, cognitive behaviour therapy, etc) to improve developmentally inappropriate symptoms associated with ADHD including distractibility, short attention span, hyperactivity, emotional lability, and impulsivity. Although the underlying pathophysiology that causes ADHD remains unclear, evidence suggests that dysregulation in noradrenergic and dopaminergic pathways plays a critical role in suboptimal executive functioning within prefrontal regions of the brain, which are involved in attention and memory.[A178090] Atomoxetine has been shown to specifically increase NA and DA within the prefrontal cortex, but not in the nucleus accumbens (NA) or striatum.[A18262] This is beneficial in the treatment of ADHD as DA activation in the subcortical NA and striatum is associated with many stimulant-associated side effects and an increase in abuse potential, which is a limiting factor associated with the use of stimulant medications such as [DB00422], [DB01576], and [DB01255].[A18262] Use of non-stimulant medications such as atomoxetine is therefore thought to offer a clinical advantage over the use of traditional medications for the management of ADHD. More recently, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies in rhesus monkeys have shown that atomoxetine also binds to the serotonin transporter (SERT),[A178111] and blocks the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor,[A18263] indicating a role for the glutamatergic system in the pathophysiology of ADHD.     Long-acting formulations of psychostimulants (such as [DB00422], [DB01576], and [DB01255]) are typically considered the most effective and first-line treatment for ADHD in adults and children as recommended by CADDRA (Canadian ADHD Resource Alliance).[L6037] However, these stimulant medications are limited by dose-related side effects and concerns of abuse. Many contain a blackbox warning stating that CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate-containing products and amphetamines, have a high potential for abuse and dependence.[A177556] Concerns about abuse potential have spurred research into medications with fewer effects on DA and the use of non-stimulant ADHD medications including atomoxetine, [DB00745] and [DB01018]. The non-stimulant norepinephrine/dopamine reuptake inhibitor [DB01156] (commonly used for the treatment of depression and for smoking cessation) has also been shown to be effective in the treatment of ADHD.[A178099]Atomoxetine is a selective norepinephrine (NE) reuptake inhibitor used for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Atomoxetine has been shown to specifically increase norepinephrine and dopamine within the prefrontal cortex, which results in improved ADHD symptoms.[A18262, A18262, F4639]    Due to atomoxetine's noradrenergic activity, it also has effects on the cardiovascular system such as increased blood pressure and tachycardia.[T244] Sudden deaths, stroke, and myocardial infarction have been reported in patients taking atomoxetine at usual doses for ADHD. Atomoxetine should be used with caution in patients whose underlying medical conditions could be worsened by increases in blood pressure or heart rate such as certain patients with hypertension, tachycardia, or cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. It should not be used in patients with severe cardiac or vascular disorders whose condition would be expected to deteriorate if they experienced clinically important increases in blood pressure or heart rate. Although the role of atomoxetine in these cases is unknown, consideration should be given to not treating patients with clinically significant cardiac abnormalities. Patients who develop symptoms such as exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, or other symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease during atomoxetine treatment should undergo a prompt cardiac evaluation.[F4639]    In general, particular care should be taken in treating ADHD in patients with comorbid bipolar disorder because of concern for possible induction of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Treatment emergent psychotic or manic symptoms, e.g., hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania in children and adolescents without a prior history of psychotic illness or mania can be caused by atomoxetine at usual doses. If such symptoms occur, consideration should be given to a possible causal role of atomoxetine, and discontinuation of treatment should be considered.[F4639]    Atomoxetine capsules increased the risk of suicidal ideation in short-term studies in children and adolescents with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). All pediatric patients being treated with atomoxetine  should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.[F4639]    Postmarketing reports indicate that atomoxetine can cause severe liver injury. Although no evidence of liver injury was detected in clinical trials of about 6000 patients, there have been rare cases of clinically significant liver injury that were considered probably or possibly related to atomoxetine use in postmarketing experience. Rare cases of liver failure have also been reported, including a case that resulted in a liver transplant. Atomoxetine should be discontinued in patients with jaundice or laboratory evidence of liver injury, and should not be restarted. Laboratory testing to determine liver enzyme levels should be done upon the first symptom or sign of liver dysfunction (e.g., pruritus, dark urine, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, or unexplained “flu like�?symptoms).[F4639]Atomoxetine is known to be a potent and selective inhibitor of the norepinephrine transporter (NET),[A175723] which prevents cellular reuptake of norepinephrine throughout the brain, which is thought to improve the symptoms of ADHD. More recently, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies in rhesus monkeys have shown that atomoxetine also binds to the serotonin transporter (SERT),[A178111] and blocks the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor,[A18263] indicating a role for the glutamatergic system in the pathophysiology of ADHD.

135,"For treatment of chronic lymphatic (lymphocytic) leukemia,  childhood minimal-change nephrotic syndrome, and malignant lymphomas including lymphosarcoma, giant follicular lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease,  non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia.A nitrogen mustard alkylating agent used as antineoplastic agent for the treatment of various malignant and nonmalignant diseases. Although it is less toxic than most other nitrogen mustards, it has been listed as a known carcinogen in the Fourth Annual Report on Carcinogens (NTP 85-002, 1985). (Merck Index, 11th ed)Chlorambucil is an antineoplastic in the class of alkylating agents that is used to treat various forms of cancer. Alkylating agents are so named because of their ability to add alkyl groups to many electronegative groups under conditions present in cells. They stop tumor growth by cross-linking guanine bases in DNA double-helix strands - directly attacking DNA. This makes the strands unable to uncoil and separate. As this is necessary in DNA replication, the cells can no longer divide. In addition, these drugs add methyl or other alkyl groups onto molecules where they do not belong which in turn inhibits their correct utilization by base pairing and causes a miscoding of DNA. Alkylating agents are cell cycle-nonspecific. Alkylating agents work by three different mechanisms all of which achieve the same end result - disruption of DNA function and cell death.Alkylating agents work by three different mechanisms: 1) attachment of alkyl groups to DNA bases, resulting in the DNA being fragmented by repair enzymes in their attempts to replace the alkylated bases, preventing DNA synthesis and RNA transcription from the affected DNA, 2) DNA damage via the formation of cross-links (bonds between atoms in the DNA) which prevents DNA from being separated for synthesis or transcription, and 3) the induction of mispairing of the nucleotides leading to mutations."
136,"Used in the induction of general anesthesia.Imidazole derivative anesthetic and hypnotic with little effect on blood gases, ventilation, or the cardiovascular system. It has been proposed as an induction anesthetic.Etomidate is a non-barbiturate hypnotic that acts at the level of the reticular-activating system to produce anesthesia. Etomidate is an imidazole compound that appears to depress CNS function via GABA. Duration of action is intermediate between thiopental and methohexital, and recovery from a single dose is rapid with little residual depression. Like the barbiturates and propofol, etomidate is does not induce analgesia. Etomidate induces unconsciousness within one circulation time. Recovery is rapid as a result of extensive redistribution and rapid metabolism.Etomidate binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl- ionopore at the GABAA receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl- ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged."
137,"For the treatment of malignant neoplasm of colon and rectumRaltitrexed (brand name Tomudex&reg;) is a chemotherapy drug manufactured AstraZeneca Company, is an antimetabolite used in chemotherapy. It is an inhibitor of thymidylate synthase.Raltitrexed belongs to a group of medicines known as antimetabolites. It is used to treat cancer of the colon and rectum. It may also be used to treat other kinds of cancer, as determined by your doctor. Raltitrexed blocks an enzyme needed by the cell to live. This interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected by raltitrexed, other effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor. Other effects, like hair loss, may not be serious but may cause concern.Raltitrexed is an antineoplastic Agents and folic acid antagonists. Raltitrexed inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS) leading to DNA fragmentation and cell death. It is transported into cells via a reduced folate carrier. Inside the cell Raltitrexed is extensively polyglutamated, which enhances thymidylate synthase inhibitory power and duration. Inhibition of this enzyme results in decreased synthesis of thymidine triphosphate which is required for DNA synthesis. "
138,"Morphine is used for the management of chronic, moderate to severe pain.[A176050]    Opiods, including morphine, are effective for the short term management of pain. Patients taking opioids long term may need to be monitored for the development of physical dependence, addiction disorder, and drug abuse.[L5728]Morphine, the main alkaloid of opium, was first obtained from poppy seeds in 1805.[A176035] It is a potent analgesic, though its use is limited due to tolerance, withdrawal, and the risk of abuse.[A176050] Morphine is still routinely used today, though there are a number of semi-synthetic opioids of varying strength such as [codeine], [fentanyl], [methadone], [hydrocodone], [hydromorphone], [meperidine], and [oxycodone].    Morphine was granted FDA approval in 1941.[L12114]Morphine binding to opioid receptors blocks transmission of nociceptive signals, signals pain-modulating neurons in the spinal cord, and inhibits primary afferent nociceptors to the dorsal horn sensory projection cells.[A176035]    Morphine has a time to onset of 6-30 minutes.[A176035] Excess consumption of morphine and other opioids can lead to changes in synaptic neuroplasticity, including changes in neuron density, changes at postsynaptic sites, and changes at dendritic terminals.[A176056]    Intravenous morphine's analgesic effect is sex dependent. The EC<sub>50</sub> in men is 76ng/mL and in women is 22ng/mL.[A176116]    Morphine-6-glucuronide is 22 times less potent than morphine in eliciting pupil constriction.[A176116]Morphine-6-glucuronide is responsible for approximately 85% of the response observed by morphine administration.[A176059] Morphine and its metabolites act as agonists of the mu and kappa opioid receptors.[A176035] The mu-opioid receptor is integral to morphine's effects on the ventral tegmental area of the brain. Morphine's activation of the reward pathway is mediated by agonism of the delta-opioid receptor in the nucleus accumbens,[A176050] while modification of the respiratory system and addiction disorder are mediated by agonism of the mu-opioid receptor.[A176056]"
139,"Used to treat bacterial infection by susceptible microorganisms.Antibiotic analog of [cloxacillin].Flucloxacillin is a penicillin beta-lactam antibiotic used in the treatment of bacterial infections caused by susceptible, usually gram-positive, organisms. The name ""penicillin"" can either refer to several variants of penicillin available, or to the group of antibiotics derived from the penicillins. Flucloxacillin has <i>in vitro</i> activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The bactericidal activity of Flucloxacillin results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis and is mediated through flucloxacillin binding to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). Flucloxacillin is stable against hydrolysis by a variety of beta-lactamases, including penicillinases, and cephalosporinases and extended spectrum beta-lactamases.By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, flucloxacillin inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that flucloxacillin interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."
140,"Taken orally, tranexamic acid is indicated for the treatment of hereditary angioedema,[L31883] cyclic heavy menstrual bleeding in premenopausal females,[L31858] and other instances of significant bleeding in the context of hyperfibrinolysis.[L31883] Given intravenously, tranexamic acid is indicated for short-term use (2-8 days) in patients with hemophilia to prevent or reduce bleeding following tooth extraction.[L31853]Tranexamic acid is a synthetic derivative of [lysine] used as an antifibrinolytic in the treatment and prevention of major bleeding. It possesses a similar mechanism of action to [aminocaproic acid] but is approximately 10-fold more potent.[L31883]    It was first patented in 1957[A230108] and received its initial US approval in 1986.[L31858]Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic that competitively inhibits the activation of plasminogen to plasmin.[L31858] At much higher concentrations it behaves as a noncompetitive inhibitor of plasmin similar to [aminocaproic acid], a similar antifibrinolytic which is 10-fold less potent.[L31883] Tranexamic acid binds more strongly than aminocaproic acid to both the strong and weak receptor sites of the plasminogen molecule in a ratio corresponding to the difference in potency between the compounds. In patients with hereditary angioedema, inhibition of the formation and activity of plasmin by tranexamic acid may prevent attacks of angioedema by decreasing plasmin-induced activation of the first complement protein (C1).[A230113]     Off-target antagonism of GABA(A) receptors may be associated with the development of convulsions and hyperexcitability following tranexamic acid administration[A229383] - the risk appears higher with improper administration or administration during cardiovascular surgery.[L31883] Consider EEG monitoring of patients with a history of seizure.Tranexamic acid competitively and reversibly inhibits the activation of plasminogen via binding at several distinct sites, including four or five low-affinity sites and one high-affinity site, the latter of which is involved in its binding to fibrin. The binding of plasminogen to fibrin induces fibrinolysis - by occupying the necessary binding sites tranexamic acid prevents this dissolution of fibrin, thereby stabilizing the clot and preventing hemorrhage.[L31858]"

Desogestrel main therapeutic effect due to its mechanism of action is known to be related to the inhibition of the ovulation in 97% of the cycles. This effect was proven in clinical trials in non-breastfeeding women from which the Pearl failure rate was reported to be of 0.17 per 100 women-years. This result indicated that desogestrel is more efficient when compared to other progestogen-only pills.[A176345] All the therapeutic effect is produced by a transformation of the endometrium followed by an inhibition of the ovulation due to the suppression of other hormones.[T521]    Desogestrel has been widely confirmed to be related to an increase in the risk of venous thromboembolism due to the driven increased in blood coagulation factors, leading to a pronounced prothrombotic state.[A176315] However, the effects of desogestrel are known to not impact significantly the level of total cholesterol remaining in the range of change of 10% which allows it to be a molecule that presents a favorable lipid profile.[A176339]Desogestrel enters the cell passively and acts by binding selectively to the progesterone receptor and generating low androgenic activity.[T357] Its binding produces an effect like a transcription factor and thus, it produces modifications in the mRNA synthesis.[T34]    The active metabolite of desogestrel, [etonogestrel], presents a combination of high progestational activity with minimal intrinsic androgenicity.[FDA label]"

Mitomycin is also indicated as a pyelocalyceal solution for the treatment of adults with low-grade upper tract urothelial cancer (LG-UTUC).[L12867]Mitomycin is an antineoplastic antibiotic first isolated by Japanese microbiologists in the 1950s from cultures of _Streptomyces caespitosus_.[L12867,A193419] It is an alkylating agent that inhibits DNA synthesis (and, at higher concentrations, RNA and protein synthesis) by cross-linking the complementary strands of the DNA double helix.[A193419] Few other antibiotics have been discovered that work via this alkylating mechanism, making mitomycin relatively unique in the space of microbiota-derived therapies.[A193419]    Mitomycin's cross-linking activity has resulted in its approval for the treatment of a variety of cancers - the most recent of which is an April 2020 approval for its use in low-grade Upper Tract Urothelial Cancer (LG-UTUC)[L12867] - as well as adjunctly to _ab externo_ glaucoma surgeries.Mitomycin is one of the older chemotherapy drugs, which has been around and in use for decades. It is an antibiotic which has been shown to have antitumor activity. Mitomycin selectively inhibits the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The guanine and cytosine content correlates with the degree of mitomycin-induced cross-linking. At high concentrations of the drug, cellular RNA and protein synthesis are also suppressed. Mitomycin has been shown <i>in vitro</i> to inhibit B cell, T cell, and macrophage proliferation and impair antigen presentation, as well as the secretion of interferon gamma, TNFa, and IL-2.Mitomycin is activated in vivo to a bifunctional and trifunctional alkylating agent. Binding to DNA leads to cross-linking and inhibition of DNA synthesis and function. Mitomycin is cell cycle phase-nonspecific."
144,"For use as a sedative and hypnotic.Talbutal, also called 5-allyl-5-sec-butylbarbituric acid, is a barbiturate with a short to intermediate duration of action. Talbutal is a schedule III drug in the U.S.Talbutal is a short to intermediate-acting barbiturate that is a nonselective central nervous system (CNS) depressant. As with other barbiturates, talbutal is capable of producing all levels of CNS mood alteration from excitation to mild sedation, hypnosis, and deep coma. Barbiturates may also induce anesthesia at sufficiently high therapeutic doses. Talbutal binds to GABAAreceptors at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl- ionopore of the receptor. Upon binding, talbutal increases the duration of time for which the Cl- ionopore is open, leading to prolonged inhibitory effect of GABA at the postsynaptic thalamic neuron. "
145,"Used orally for the treatment of skin manifestations of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) in patients who are refractory to at least one prior systemic therapy. Also used topically for the treatment of skin lesions in early (stage IA and IB) CTCL in patients who experience refractory or persistent disease with the use of other therapies or are intolerant of other therapies.Bexarotene (Targretin) is an antineoplastic agent indicated by the FDA for Cutaneous T cell lymphoma. It has been used off-label for lung cancer, breast cancer, and Kaposi's sarcoma.Bexarotene is a member of a subclass of retinoids that selectively activate retinoid X receptors (RXRs). These retinoid receptors have biologic activity distinct from that of retinoic acid receptors (RARs). Bexarotene is indicated for the treatment of cutaneous manifestations of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in patients who are refractory to at least one prior systemic therapy. Bexarotene selectively binds and activates retinoid X receptor subtypes (RXRα, RXRβ, RXRγ). RXRs can form heterodimers with various receptor partners such as retinoic acid receptors (RARs), vitamin D receptor, thyroid receptor, and peroxisome proliferator activator receptors (PPARs). Once activated, these receptors function as transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes that control cellular differentiation and proliferation. Bexarotene inhibits the growth in vitroof some tumor cell lines of hematopoietic and squamous cell origin. It also induces tumor regressionin vivo in some animal models.Bexarotene selectively binds with and activates retinoid X receptor subtypes. There are three subtypes in total: RXRα, RXRβ, RXRγ. The exact mechanism of action of bexarotene in the treatment of CTCL is unknown but the drug has activity in all clinical stages of CTCL."
146,"Indicated for the rapid conversion of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter of recent onset to sinus rhythm.Ibutilide is a Class III antiarrhythmic agent available in intravenous formulations. It is indicated for the conversion of acute atrial flutter and recent onset atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm (NSR).Ibutilide prolongs the action potential duration and increases both atrial and ventricular refractoriness in vivo, i.e., class III electrophysiologic effects. Voltage clamp studies indicate that ibutilide, at nanomolar concentrations, delays repolarization by activation of a slow, inward current (predominantly sodium), rather than by blocking outward potassium currents, which is the mechanism by which most other class III antiarrhythmics act.Ibutilide is a 'pure' class III antiarrhythmic drug, used intravenously against atrial flutter and fibrillation. At a cellular level it exerts two main actions: induction of a persistent Na+ current sensitive to dihydropyridine Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blockers and potent inhibition of the cardiac rapid delayed rectifier K<sup>+</sup> current, by binding within potassium channel pores. In other words, Ibutilide binds to and alters the activity of hERG potassium channels, delayed inward rectifier potassium (IKr) channels and L-type (dihydropyridine sensitive) calcium channels"
147,"For the treatment of acute leukaemia, malignant lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, acute erythraemia and acute panmyelosisVinblastine derivative with antineoplastic activity against cancer. Major side effects are myelosuppression and neurotoxicity. Vindesine is used extensively in chemotherapy protocols (antineoplastic combined chemotherapy protocols).Vindesine is indicated for the treatment of acute lymphocytic leukemia of childhood that is resistant to vincristine and non-oat cell lung cancer. Vindesine causes the arrest of cells in metaphase mitosis. It is three times more potent than vincristine and nearly 10 times more potent than vinblastine in causing mitotic arrest in <i>in vitro</i> studies at doses designed to arrest from 10 to 15% of the cells in mitosis. Vindesine and vincristine are approximately equipotent at dose levels that arrest 40 to 50% of the cells in mitosis. Unlike vinblastine, vindesine produces very few postmetaphase cells. Vindesine has demonstrated activity in patients who have relapsed while receiving multiple-agent treatment that included vincristine.Vindesine acts by causing the arrest of cells in metaphase mitosis through its inhibition tubulin mitotic funcitoning. The drug is cell-cycle specific for the S phase."
148,"Chlorthalidone is indicated in the management of hypertension either as the sole therapeutic agent or to enhance the effect of other antihypertensive drugs in the more severe forms of hypertension.    Chlorthalidone is indicated as adjunctive therapy in edema associated with congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, and corticosteroid and estrogen therapy.    Chlorthalidone has also been found useful in edema due to various forms of renal dysfunction, such as nephrotic syndrome, acute glomerulonephritis, and chronic renal failure.Chlorthalidone is a thiazide-like diuretic used for the treatment of hypertension and for management of edema caused by conditions such as heart failure or renal impairment. Chlorthalidone improves blood pressure and swelling by preventing water absorption from the kidneys through inhibition of the Na+/Cl�?symporter in the distal convoluted tubule cells in the kidney. The exact mechanism of chlorthalidone's anti-hypertensive effect is under debate, however, it is thought that increased diuresis results in decreased plasma and extracellular fluid volume, decreased cardiac output and therefore overall reduction in blood pressure.[A176324]    Chlorthalidone is considered first-line therapy for management of uncomplicated hypertension as there is strong evidence from meta-analyses that thiazide diuretics such as chlorthalidone reduce the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and cardiovascular all-cause mortality in patients with hypertension.[A173863] In particular, the ALLHAT trial confirmed the role of thiazide diuretics as first-line therapy and demonstrated that chlorthalidone had a statistically significant lower incidence of stroke and heart failure when compared to [DB00722], [DB00381], or [DB00590].[A173884, A173887] Further studies have indicated that low-dose thiazides are as good as, and in some secondary endpoints, better than β-blockers, ACE inhibitors, Calcium Channel Blockers or ARBs.    Chlorthalidone has been shown to have a number of pleiotropic effects that differentiate it from other diuretics such as [DB00999]. In addition to its antihypertensive effects, chlorthalidone has also been shown to decrease platelet aggregation and vascular permeability, as well as promote angiogenesis in vitro, which is thought to be partly the result of reductions in carbonic anhydrase–dependent pathways. These pathways may play a role in chlorthalidone's cardiovascular risk reduction effects.[A176330]Chlorthalidone prevents reabsorption of sodium and chloride through inhibition of the Na+/Cl- symporter in the cortical diluting segment of the ascending limb of the loop of Henle.[A16730] Reduction of sodium reabsorption subsequently reduces extracellular fluid and plasma volume via an osmotic, sodium-driven diuresis. By increasing the delivery of sodium to the distal renal tubule, Chlorthalidone indirectly increases potassium excretion via the sodium-potassium exchange mechanism. The exact mechanism of chlorthalidone's anti-hypertensive effect is under debate, however, it is thought that increased diuresis results in decreased plasma and extracellular fluid volume which therefore requires decreased cardiac output and overall lowers blood pressure.[A176324] Chlorthalidone has also been shown to decrease platelet aggregation and vascular permeability, as well as promote angiogenesis in vitro, which is thought to be partly the result of reductions in carbonic anhydrase–dependent pathways. These pathways may play a role in chlorthalidone's cardiovascular risk reduction effects.[A176330]"
149,"For use in the treatment of duodenal ulcers, as a diuretic, and in the treatment of glaucoma, and may also be useful in the treatment of seizures associated with epilepsy.Ethoxzolamide is a sulfonamide used as diuretic and in glaucoma. It inhibits carbonic anhydrase activity in proximal renal tubules to decrease reabsorption of water, sodium, potassium, bicarbonate. Its pharmacological activity thus confers the risk for hypokalemia.Ethoxzolamide is an inhibitor of the carbonic anhydrase enzyme in proximal renal tubules that works by decreasing the reabsorption of water, sodium, potassium, bicarbonate. It also decreases the activity of carbonic anhydrase expressed in the CNS, which leads to increased seizure threshold. Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the eye contributes to its effect of reducing intraocular pressure and decreasing aqueous humor. Ethoxzolamide binds to and inhibits carbonic anhydrase I, which plays an essential role in facilitating the transport of CO2 and H+ in the intracellular space, across biological membranes, and in the layers of the extracellular space. Through inhibition of the enzyme, the balance of applicable membrane equilibrium systems are affected. "
150,"For the short-term treatment of insomnia.A short-acting barbiturate that is effective as a sedative and hypnotic (but not as an anti-anxiety) agent and is usually given orally. It is prescribed more frequently for sleep induction than for sedation but, like similar agents, may lose its effectiveness by the second week of continued administration. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1994, p236)Pentobarbital, a barbiturate, is used for the treatment of short term insomnia. It belongs to a group of medicines called central nervous system (CNS) depressants that induce drowsiness and relieve tension or nervousness. Little analgesia is conferred by barbiturates; their use in the presence of pain may result in excitation.Pentobarbital binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl- ionopore at the GABAA receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl- ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged. All of these effects are associated with marked decreases in GABA-sensitive neuronal calcium conductance (gCa). The net result of barbiturate action is acute potentiation of inhibitory GABAergic tone. Barbiturates also act through potent (if less well characterized) and direct inhibition of excitatory AMPA-type glutamate receptors, resulting in a profound suppression of glutamatergic neurotransmission."
151,"**Indicated** for:[Label]     1) Use as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy in the management of complex partial seizures and simple or complex absence seizures.     2) Adjunctive therapy in the management of multiple seizure types that include absence seizures.     3) Prophylaxis of migraine headaches.    4) Acute management of mania associated with bipolar disorder.      **Off-label** uses include:     1) Maintenance therapy for bipolar disorder.[A177919]    2) Treatment for acute bipolar depression.[A177928,A177931,A177934]    3) Emergency treatment of status epilepticus.[A177955]Valproic acid, or valproate, is an fatty acid derivative and anticonvulsant originally synthesized in 1881 by Beverly S. Burton.[A178051] It enjoyed use as a popular organic solvent in industry and pharmaceutical manufacturing for nearly a century. In 1963, a serendipitous discovery was made by George Carraz during his investigations into the anticonvulsant effects of khelline when he found that all of his samples, dissolved in valproic acid, exerted a similar degree of anticonvulsive activity. It first received approval on February 28, 1978 from the FDA under the trade name Depakene.[L6190]    Since then, it has been investigated for neuroprotective, anti-manic, and anti-migraine effects. It is currently a compound of interest in the field of oncology for its anti-proliferative effects and is the subject of many clinical trials in a variety of cancer types.Valproate has been shown to reduce the incidence of complex partial seizures and migraine headaches.[FDA Label,A177841] It also improves symptom control in bipolar mania.[A178033] Although the exact mechanisms responsible are unknown, it is thought that valproate produces increased cortical inhibition to contribute to control of neural synchrony. It is also thought that valproate exerts a neuroprotective effect preventing damage and neural degeneration in epilepsy, migraines, and bipolar disorder.    Valproate is hepatotoxic and teratogenic. The reasons for this are unclear but have been attributed to the genomic effects of the drug.[A457]    A small proof-of concept study found that valproate increases clearance of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) when combined with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) by reactivating the virus to allow clearance, however, a larger multicentre trial failed to show a significant effect on HIV reservoirs when added to HAART.[A458,A177859] The FDA labeling contains a warning regarding HIV reactivation during valproate use.[label].The exact mechanisms by which valproate exerts it's effects on epilepsy, migraine headaches, and bipolar disorder are unknown however several pathways exist which may contribute to the drug's action.    Valproate is known to inhibit succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase.[A177991] This inhibition results in an increase in succinic semialdehyde which acts as an inhibitor of GABA transaminase ultimately reducing GABA metabolism and increasing GABAergic neurotransmission. As GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter, this increase results in increased inhibitory activity.[A457] A possible secondary contributor to cortical inhibition is a direct suppression of voltage gated sodium channel activity and indirect suppression through effects on GABA.    It has also been suggested that valproate impacts the extracellular signal-related kinase pathway (ERK).[A457] These effects appear to be dependent on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) and result in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. This activation increases expression of several downstream targets including ELK-1 with subsequent increases in c-fos, growth cone-associated protein-43 which contributes to neural plasticity, B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia-2 which is an anti-apoptotic protein, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) which is also involved in neural plasticity and growth. Increased neurogenesis and neurite growth due to valproate are attributed to the effects of this pathway. An additional downstream effect of increased BDNF expression appears to be an increase in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors which contribute further to increased GABAergic activity.[A177997]    Valproate exerts a non-competitive indirect inhibitory effect on myo-inosital-1-phophate synthetase.[A178000] This results in reduced de novo synthesis of inositol monophosphatase and subsequent inositol depletion. It is unknown how this contributed to valproate's effects on bipolar disorder but [lithium] is known to exert a similar inositol-depleting effect.[A178003] Valproate exposure also appears to produce down-regulation of protein kinase C proteins (PKC)-α and -ε which are potentially related to bipolar disorder as PKC is unregulated in the frontal cortex of bipolar patients. This is further supported by a similar reduction in PKC with lithium.[A178015] The inhibition of the PKC pathway may also be a contributor to migraine prophylaxis.[A178018] Myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate, a PKC substrate, is also downregulated by valproate and may contribute to changes in synaptic remodeling through effects on the cytoskeleton.[A178021]    Valproate also appears to impact fatty acid metabolism.[A457] Less incorporation of fatty acid substrates in sterols and glycerolipids is thought to impact membrane fluidity and result in increased action potential threshold potentially contributing to valproate's antiepileptic action.[A178024] Valproate has been found to be a non-competitive direct inhibitor of brain microsomal long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase.[A14708] Inhibition of this enzyme decreases available arichidonyl-CoA, a substrate in the production of inflammatory prostaglandins. It is thought that this may be a mechanism behind valproate's efficacy in migraine prophylaxis as migraines are routinely treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs which also inhibit prostaglandin production.    Finally, valproate acts as a direct histone deactylase (HDAC) inhibitor.[A178030] Hyperacetylation of lysine residues on histones promoted DNA relaxation and allows for increased gene transcription. The scope of valproate's genomic effects is wide with 461 genes being up or down-regulated.[A178027] The relation of these genomic effects to therapeutic value is not fully characterized however H3 and H4 hyperacetylation correlates with improvement of symptoms in bipolar patients.[A178033] Histone hyperacetylation at the BDNF gene, increasing BDNF expression, post-seizure is known to occur and is thought to be a neuroprotective mechanism which valproate may strengthen or prolong.[A178036] H3 hyperacetylation is associated with a reduction in glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a pro-apoptotic enzyme, contributing further to valproate's neuroprotective effects.[A11814]"
152,"Used in the treatment of tuberculosis in combination with other drugs.Cyclic peptide antibiotic similar to viomycin. It is produced by Streptomyces capreolus.Capreomycin is a member of the aminoglycoside family of antibiotics. These antibiotics have the ability to kill a wide variety of bacteria, including bacteria responsible for causing tuberculosis (TB).Little is known about capreomycin's exact mechanism of action, but it is thought to inhibit protein synthesis by binding to the 70S ribosomal unit. Capreomycin also binds to components in the bacterial cell which result in the production of abnormal proteins. These proteins are necessary for the bacteria's survival. Therefore the production of these abnormal proteins is ultimately fatal to the bacteria."
153,"Zolmitriptan is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without auras in patients aged 18 and over.[L12978]Zolmitriptan is a member of the triptan class of 5-hydroxytryptamine(5-HT)1B/1D/(1F) receptor agonists used to treat acute migraine.[A462, L12978] [Sumatriptan] was the first triptan to be developed, but had poor oral bioavailability and lipophilicity. This led to the development of second-generation triptans, including [almotriptan], [eletriptan], [frovatriptan], [naratriptan], [rizatriptan], and zolmitriptan.[A193791] Triptans can be administered alone or in combination with an NSAID like [naproxen], and represent the current ""gold standard"" for acute migraine treatment.[A193797]    Zolmitriptan was first approved by the FDA for sale by Zeneca Pharmaceuticals under the trade name Zomig® on November 25, 1997. It is currently available in both tablet and nasal spray forms.[L12978]Zolmitriptan, like other triptans, is a serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) receptor agonist, with enhanced specificity for the 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptor subtypes. It is through the downstream effects of 5-HT1B/1D activation that triptans are proposed to provide acute relief of migraines.[L12978,A462,A193791] Zolmitriptan is also a vasoconstrictor,[A193803] leading to possible adverse cardiovascular effects such as myocardial ischemia/infarction, arrhythmias, cerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, gastrointestinal ischemia, and peripheral vasospastic reactions. In addition, chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, and/or pressure has been reported, along with the possibility of medication overuse headaches and serotonin syndrome. Patients with phenylketonuria should be advised that ZOMIG-ZMT contains phenylalanine.[L12978]Migraines are complex physiological events characterized by unilateral throbbing headaches combined with photophobia and other aversions to sensory input. Migraine attacks are generally divided into phases: the premonitory phase, which typically involves irritability, fatigue, yawning, and stiff neck; the headache phase, which lasts for between four and 72 hours; and the postdrome phase, which lasts for up to a day following resolution of pain and whose symptoms are similar to those of the premonitory phase. In addition, neurological deficits, collectively termed migraine aura, may precede the headache phase.[A193797, A193794]    The underlying pathophysiology of migraines is a matter of active research but involves both neurological and vascular components. The head pain associated with migraine is thought to be a consequence of activation of the nociceptive nerves comprising the trigeminocervical complex (TCC).[A193794] Terminals of nociceptive nerves that innervate the dura matter release vasoactive peptides, such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), resulting in cranial vasodilation. Finally, when present, migraine aura appears to correlate with a transient wave(s) of cortical depolarization, termed cortical spreading depression (CSD).[A193794,A193851]    Triptans, including zolmitriptan, are proposed to act in three ways. The main mechanism is through modulation of nociceptive nerve signalling in the central nervous system through 5-HT1B/1Dreceptors throughout the TCC and associated areas of the brain. In addition, triptans can enhance vasoconstriction, both through direct 5-HT1B-mediated dilation of cranial blood vessels,[A462, A198741] as well as through 5-HT1D-mediated suppression of CGRP release.[A193794, L12978]    Although triptans are classically described solely in terms of their effects on 5-HT1B/1D receptors, they also act as 5-HT1F agonists as well. This 5-HT subtype is also found throughout the TCC, but is not present appreciably in cerebral vasculature; the significance of triptan-mediated 5-HT1F activation is currently not well described.[A193791] Additionally, CSD that initiates in the ipsilateral parietal region may exert its effects in a manner that relies on 5-HT1B/1D receptor activation, suggesting that triptans may have some effect on CSD-mediated symptoms.[A193794, A198738]"
154,"In general, acetaminophen is used for the treatment of mild to moderate pain and reduction of fever.[F4124] It is available over the counter in various forms, the most common being oral forms.    Acetaminophen _injection_ is indicated for the management of mild to moderate pain, the management of moderate to severe pain with adjunctive opioid analgesics, and the reduction of fever.[Label]    Because of its low risk of causing allergic reactions, this drug can be administered in patients who are intolerant to salicylates and those with allergic tendencies, including bronchial asthmatics.[F4124] Specific dosing guidelines should be followed when administering acetaminophen to children.[L5780]Acetaminophen (paracetamol), also commonly known as _Tylenol_, is the most commonly taken analgesic worldwide and is recommended as first-line therapy in pain conditions by the World Health Organization (WHO).[A176318] It is also used for its antipyretic effects, helping to reduce fever.[F4124] This drug was initially approved by the U.S. FDA in 1951 and is available in a variety of forms including syrup form, regular tablets, effervescent tablets, injection, suppository, and other forms.[L5756,L5774,F4124,Label]    Acetaminophen is often found combined with other drugs in more than 600 over the counter (OTC) allergy medications, cold medications, sleep medications, pain relievers, and other products.[L5783] Confusion about dosing of this drug may be caused by the availability of different formulas, strengths, and dosage instructions for children of different ages.[L5783] Due to the possibility of fatal overdose and liver failure associated with the incorrect use of acetaminophen, it is important to follow current and available national and manufacturer dosing guidelines while this drug is taken or prescribed.[L5786,L5789,Label]Animal and clinical studies have determined that acetaminophen has both antipyretic and analgesic effects. This drug has been shown to lack anti-inflammatory effects. As opposed to the _salicylate_ drug class, acetaminophen does not disrupt tubular secretion of uric acid and does not affect acid-base balance if taken at the recommended doses.[F4124] Acetaminophen does not disrupt hemostasis and does not have inhibitory activities against platelet aggregation.[Label,F4124] Allergic reactions are rare occurrences following acetaminophen use.[F4124] According to its FDA labeling, acetaminophen's exact mechanism of action has not been fully established[Label] - despite this, it is often categorized alongside NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) due to its ability to inhibit the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathways.[T518] It is thought to exert central actions which ultimately lead to the alleviation of pain symptoms.[T518]    One theory is that acetaminophen increases the pain threshold by inhibiting two isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1 and COX-2, which are involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Prostaglandins are responsible for eliciting pain sensations.[A176366] Acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, therefore, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory effects. Though acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the active site of this enzyme, studies have shown that acetaminophen (paracetamol) blocks COX indirectly.[F4133] Studies also suggest that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant type of the COX enzyme that is unique from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2.[A468] This enzyme has been referred to as _COX-3_. The antipyretic actions of acetaminophen are likely attributed to direct action on heat-regulating centers in the brain, resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating, and loss of body heat.[F4133] The exact mechanism of action of this drug is not fully understood at this time, but future research may contribute to deeper knowledge.[F4133] "
155,"For the continued treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after failure of either platinum-based or docetaxel chemotherapies.Gefitinib (originally coded ZD1839) is a drug used in the treatment of certain types of cancer. Acting in a similar manner to erlotinib (marketed as Tarceva), gefitinib selectively targets the mutant proteins in malignant cells. It is marketed by AstraZeneca under the trade name Iressa.Gefitinib inhibits the intracellular phosphorylation of numerous tyrosine kinases associated with transmembrane cell surface receptors, including the tyrosine kinases associated with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR-TK). EGFR is expressed on the cell surface of many normal cells and cancer cells.Gefitinib is an inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase that binds to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding site of the enzyme. EGFR is often shown to be overexpressed in certain human carcinoma cells, such as lung and breast cancer cells. Overexpression leads to enhanced activation of the anti-apoptotic Ras signal transduction cascades, subsequently resulting in increased survival of cancer cells and uncontrolled cell proliferation. Gefitinib is the first selective inhibitor of the EGFR tyrosine kinase which is also referred to as Her1 or ErbB-1. By inhibiting EGFR tyrosine kinase, the downstream signaling cascades are also inhibited, resulting in inhibited malignant cell proliferation. "
156,"Codeine sulfate is a form of this drug that is commonly used. It is available in tablet form [FDA label] and indicated for the relief of mild to moderately severe pain, where the use of an opioid analgesic is appropriate [FDA label].    The solution form is used by itself or combined in a syrup with other drugs and is used as a cough suppressant in adults aged 18 and above [L5521], [L5524]. The relief of pain (analgesia) is a primary goal for enhancing the quality of life of patients and for increasing the ability of patients to engage in day to day activities. Codeine, an opioid analgesic, was originally approved in the US in 1950 and is a drug used to decrease pain by increasing the threshold for pain without impairing consciousness or altering other sensory functions. Opiates such as codeine are derived from the poppy plant, _Papaver somniferum_ (Papaveraceae).[A175096]    Codeine is utilized as a central analgesic, sedative, hypnotic, antinociceptive, and antiperistaltic agent, and is also recommended in certain diseases with incessant coughing.[LABEL,A175096]**General effects**    Codeine is a weak narcotic pain reliever and cough suppressant that is similar to morphine and hydrocodone. A small amount of ingested codeine is converted to morphine in the body. Codeine increases tolerance to pain, reducing existing discomfort. In addition to decreasing pain, codeine also causes sedation, drowsiness, and respiratory depression [A175096].     **Antitussive activity**    This drug has shown antitussive activity in clinical trials [A175102] and has been effective in cough secondary to tuberculosis and insomnia due to coughing [A175096]. Codeine suppresses the cough reflex through a direct effect on the cough center in the medulla [F3658].    **Effects on intestinal motility**    Codeine may reduce intestinal motility through both a local and possibly central mechanism of action [F3661]. This may possibly lead to constipation [F3658]. The chronic use of opioids, including codeine sulfate, may lead to obstructive bowel disease, particularly in patients with underlying disorders of intestinal motility [FDA label].     **Effects on the central nervous system**    Codeine phosphate is an opioid analgesic with uses similar to those of morphine, but is much less potent as an analgesic. Its primary site of action is at the _mu_ opioid receptors distributed throughout the central nervous system. The sedative activities of codeine are less potent than those of morphine [F3658]. Codeine may cause respiratory system depression by the activation of μ-opioid receptors at specific sites in the central nervous system [A175108].    **Effects on blood pressure**    This drug poses an increased risk of compromised ability to maintain blood pressure due to peripheral vasodilation and other mechanisms [FDA label].     **Effects on chronic cancer pain and other types of pain**    Codeine is an opioid analgesic with similar indications to those of morphine, however, is much less potent in its pain alleviating properties. Its primary action takes place at the mu opioid receptors, which are distributed throughout the central nervous system. The average duration of action is about 4 hours [F3658].    Regular dosing of opioid analgesics such as codeine in patients with severe cancer pain has been well documented to improve symptoms [A175096], [A175105].Although the exact mechanism of action of codeine is still unknown, it is generally thought to be mediated through the agonism of opioid receptors, particularly the mu-opioid receptors.[A175096] Morphine was previously postulated to contribute to the analgesic effect of codeine due to the O-demethylation of codeine to morphine by CYP2D6. Particularly, CYP2D6 poor metabolizer did not experience the analgesic effect of codeine.[A473,A261461] However, this is unlikely to be the main mechanism of action of codeine as only 5% of codeine is metabolized to morphine.[A473] Other hypotheses also postulate that codeine-6-glucuronide, the main metabolite of codeine, mediates the analgesic effect of codeine as it not only has an affinity to the mu receptors as codeine but also can be metabolized to morphine-6-glucuronide, which was observed to be more potent than morphine.[A474]     Binding to the mu receptors by codeine activates the G-proteins Gαi, causing a decrease in intracellular cAMP and Ca2+ level.[A179533,A261466] This causes hyperpolarization of nociceptive neurons, thus imparing the transmission of pain signals.[A179533,A261466]    "
157,"For the treatment of polymicrobial infections.Semisynthetic, broad-spectrum, ampicillin derived ureidopenicillin antibiotic proposed for pseudomonas infections. It is also used in combination with other antibiotics.Piperacillin is a penicillin beta-lactam antibiotic used in the treatment of bacterial infections caused by susceptible, usually gram-positive, organisms. The name ""penicillin"" can either refer to several variants of penicillin available, or to the group of antibiotics derived from the penicillins. Piperacillin has <i>in vitro</i> activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The bactericidal activity of Piperacillin results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis and is mediated through Piperacillin binding to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). Piperacillin is stable against hydrolysis by a variety of beta-lactamases, including penicillinases, and cephalosporinases and extended spectrum beta-lactamases.By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, Piperacillin inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that Piperacillin interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."
158,"Dihydroergotamine (DHE) in all formulations is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults.[L38459, L38464, L38469] As an injection, DHE is also indicated for the acute treatment of cluster headache episodes.[L38459]    DHE is not indicated for migraine prevention or the management of hemiplegic or basilar migraine.[L38459, L38464, L38469]A 9,10alpha-dihydro derivative of [ergotamine]. Dihydroergotamine is used as an abortive therapy for migraines.[L38469] Its use has largely been supplanted by triptans in current therapy due to the class's greater selectivity and more favourable side effect profile.    Recent improvements have been made in the design of intranasal delivery devices allowing for greater delivery of dihydroergotamine solution to the vasculature-rich upper nasal cavity.[A239569] The recently approved Precision Olfactory Delivery technology developed by Impel Neuropharma technology has correlated with an increase of 3-fold in Cmax and 4-fold in AUC despite the solution formulated at 75% of the strength of the existing intranasal product.DHE is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine headaches with or without aura and the acute treatment of cluster headache episodes.[L38459, L38464, L38469] It is thought to exert its therapeutic effect through both neurological and vascular mechanisms.[A239104] Its serotonin agonist activity may contribute to decreasing glutamatergic activity of the trigeminal system and subsequent cortical depolarization which is thought to participate in the neurological pathophysiology of migraine.[A239099] The same serotonin agonist activity also contributes to vasoconstriction, producing both the characteristic side effect of chest tightness and potentially contributing to a therapeutic effect by counteracting the vasodilation due to calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) release in migraine attacks.[A239104]DHE has several proposed mechanisms which may contribute to its therapeutic efficacy as an abortive therapy in migraines. Firstly, DHE's s agonist action on 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) 1b receptors in the smooth muscle of the cranial vasculature may provide relief via vasoconstriction of the blood vessels which typically become dilated due to the release of CGRP during migraine attacks. [A239104, A239234] DHE's off-target action at alpha-adrenergic receptors may further contribute via this mechanism. The remaining mechanisms are thought to provide relief through the effects on the neurogenic causes of migraine symptoms. Agonist action by DHE on 5-HT1b and 5-HT1d receptors inhibits nociceptive signalling through the ventroposteromedial thalamus to the trigeminal sensory neurons. Further action on 5-HT1b and 5-HT1d receptors with the addition of agonist activity on 5-HT1f in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis decreases afferent signalling to trigeminal sensory neurons which contributes to central sensitization. The success of experimental compounds selectively targetting the 5-HT1f receptor lends support to this mechanism. Lastly, action at 5-HT1d receptors on trigeminal nerve terminals inhibits the release of vasoactive neuropeptides thought to contribute to pain and inflammation during a migraine attack. DHE is known to have 10-fold less potency at the 5-HT1b receptor than its predecessor ergotamine which reduces the incidence of vascular side effects.[A239239] Notably, DHE slowly diffuses from receptors resulting in unreliable prediction of effects from plasma concentration.

159,"This drug in indicated for the following conditions [FDA label]:    Major depressive disorder in adults [L46357]    Management of neuropathic pain in adults    Prophylactic treatment of chronic tension-type headache (CTTH) in adults    Prophylactic treatment of migraine in adults    Treatment of nocturnal enuresis in children aged 6 years and above when organic pathology, including spina bifida and related disorders, have been excluded and no response has been achieved to all other non-drug and drug treatments, including antispasmodics and vasopressin-related products. This product should only be prescribed by a healthcare professional with expertise in the management of persistent enuresis [FDA label]    Off-label uses: irritable bowel syndrome, sleep disorders, diabetic neuropathy, agitation, fibromyalgia, and insomnia Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that has been used to treat depression for decades. ELAVIL, a previously approved branded product of amitriptyline, was first approved by the FDA in 1961.[A259342] Amitriptyline has been investigated in the treatment of pain-related conditions, attributed to its analgesic properties.[A174661]**Effects in pain and depression**    Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant and an analgesic. It has anticholinergic and sedative properties [FDA label].   Clinical studies have shown that oral amitriptyline achieves, at a minimum, good to moderate response in up to 2/3 of patients diagnosed with post-herpetic neuralgia and 3/4 of patients diagnosed with diabetic neuropathic pain, and neurogenic pain syndromes that are frequently unresponsive to narcotic analgesics. Amitriptyline has also shown efficacy in diverse groups of patients with chronic non-malignant pain. There have also been some studies showing efficacy in managing fibromyalgia (an off-label use of this drug) [A174658], [A174667].    **Cardiovascular and Anticholinergic Effects**    Amitriptyline has strong anticholinergic properties and may cause ECG changes and quinidine-like effects on the heart [F3454]. Amitriptyline may inhibit ion channels, which are necessary for cardiac repolarization (hERG channels), in the upper micromolar range of therapeutic plasma concentrations. Therefore, amitriptyline may increase the risk for cardiac arrhythmia [FDA label]. Orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia can be a problem in elderly patients receiving this drug at normal doses for depression. There is evidence in the literature that these effects may occur, rarely, at the lower dosages utilized in the treatment of pain. As with any other tricyclic antidepressant agent, increased glucose levels can occur with amitriptyline [A174661].     **Effects on seizure threshold**    This drug also decreases the convulsive threshold and causes alterations in EEG and sleep patterns [F3454].  The mechanism of action of this drug is not fully elucidated. It is suggested that amitriptyline inhibits the membrane pump mechanism responsible for the re-uptake of transmitter amines, such as norepinephrine and serotonin, thereby increasing their concentration at the synaptic clefts of the brain [FDA label], [A174673].   These amines are important in regulating mood.  The monoamine hypothesis in depression, one of the oldest hypotheses, postulates that deficiencies of serotonin (5-HT) and/or norepinephrine (NE) neurotransmission in the brain lead to depressive effects [A174670].   This drug counteracts these mechanisms, and this may be the mechanism of amitriptyline in improving depressive symptoms.    Whether its analgesic effects are related to its mood-altering activities or attributable to a different, less obvious pharmacological action (or a combination of both) is unknown [A174661]."
160,"For palliative management of gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma metastatic to the liver, when given by continuous regional intra-arterial infusion in carefully selected patients who are considered incurable by surgery or other means. Also for the palliative management of liver cancer (usually administered by hepatic intra-arterial infusion).An antineoplastic antimetabolite that is metabolized to fluorouracil when administered by rapid injection. Floxuridine is available as a sterile, nonpyrogenic, lyophilized powder for reconstitution. When administered by slow, continuous, intra-arterial infusion, it is converted to floxuridine monophosphate. It has been used to treat hepatic metastases of gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and for palliation in malignant neoplasms of the liver and gastrointestinal tract.Floxuridine is an anti-metabolite or a pyrimidine analog that works by disrupting the process S-phase of cell division, selectively targeting rapidly dividing cells. Due to the structural similarities, antimetabolites act as pyrimidine-like molecules and prevent normal pyrimidines from being incorporated into DNA. After successful biotransformation, floxuridine is converted into an active component, flurouracil, which blocks the enzyme which converts cytosine nucleosides into the deoxy derivative. Flurouracil also physically prevents the incorporation of thymidine nucleotides into the DNA strand by taking their place, further preventing DNA synthesis. Floxuridine rapidly undergoes catabolism to form 5-fluorouracil, which is the active component of the drug. 5-Fluorouracil primarily works by interfering with DNA synthesis; however, it may also inhibit the formation of fraudulent RNA via physical incorporation into the RNA. It is also an inhibitor of riboside phophorylase, preventing the utilization of pre-formed uracil in RNA synthesis. Floxuridine can also form 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-phosphate (FUDR-MP), which is the monophosphate of floxuridine that inhibits thymidylate synthetase that plays a role in the methylation of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid during DNA synthesis.  FUDR-MP thus interferes with DNA synthesis."
161,"Used as an adjunct to levodopa/carbidopa therapy for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's Disease. This drug is generally reserved for patients with parkinsonian syndrome receiving levodopa/carbidopa who are experiencing symptom fluctuations and are not responding adequately to or are not candidates for other adjunctive therapies.Tolcapone is a drug that inhibits the enzyme catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT). It is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease as an adjunct to levodopa/carbidopa medication. It is a yellow, odorless, non-hygroscopic, crystalline compound. Tolcapone is associated with a risk of hepatotoxicity.Tolcapone is a potent, selective, and reversible inhibitor of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). In humans, COMT is distributed throughout various organs. COMT catalyzes the transfer of the methyl group of S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the phenolic group of substrates that contain a catechol structure. Physiological substrates of COMT include dopa, catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine) and their hydroxylated metabolites. The function of COMT is the elimination of biologically active catechols and some other hydroxylated metabolites. COMT is responsible for the elimination of biologically active catechols and some other hydroxylated metabolites. In the presence of a decarboxylase inhibitor, COMT becomes the major metabolizing enzyme for levodopa catalyzing it to 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-L-phenylalanine (3-OMD) in the brain and periphery. When tolcapone is given in conjunction with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbidopa, plasma levels of levodopa are more sustained than after administration of levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor alone. It is believed that these sustained plasma levels of levodopa result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, leading to greater effects on the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease in patients as well as increased levodopa adverse effects, sometimes requiring a decrease in the dose of levodopa.The precise mechanism of action of tolcapone is unknown, but it is believed to be related to its ability to inhibit COMT and alter the plasma pharmacokinetics of levodopa, resulting in an increase in plasma levodopa concentrations. The inhibition of COMT also causes a reduction in circulating 3-OMD as a result of decreased peripheral metabolism of levodopa. This may lead to an increase distribution of levodopa into the CNS through the reduction of its competitive substrate, 3-OMD, for transport mechanisms. Sustained levodopa concentrations presumably result in more consistent dopaminergic stimulation, resulting in greater reduction in the manifestations of parkinsonian syndrome."
162,"For the ophthalmic treatment of corticosteroid-responsive inflammation of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea and anterior segment of the globe.A glucocorticoid employed, usually as eye drops, in the treatment of allergic and inflammatory conditions of the eye. It has also been used topically in the treatment of various skin disorders. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p732)Corticosteroids such as fluorometholone inhibit the inflammatory response to a variety of inciting agents and probably delay or slow healing. They inhibit the edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation associated with inflammation.There is no generally accepted explanation for the mechanism of action of ocular corticosteroids. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2. Their primary target is the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor. After binding the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific target genes."

When you eat foods rich in calcium, the calcium will be restored to the bones and the balance between your blood and bones will be maintained.Calcium gluceptate replenishes the deminished levels of calcium in the body, returning them to normal levels."
164,"Oral indometacin is indicated for symptomatic management of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis including acute flares of chronic disease, moderate to severe ankylosing spondylitis, moderate to severe osteoarthritis, acute painful shoulder (bursitis and/or tendinitis) and acute gouty arthritis.[A177871,L6778]     Intravenous indometacin is indicated to induce closure of a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants weighing between 500 and 1750 g when after 48 hours usual medical management (e.g., fluid restriction, diuretics, digitalis, respiratory support, etc.) is ineffective.[L10553]Indometacin, or indomethacin, is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic properties. NSAIDs consist of agents that are structurally unrelated; the NSAID chemical classification of indometacin is an indole-acetic acid derivative with the chemical name 1- (p-chlorobenzoyl)25-methoxy-2-methylindole-3-acetic acid.[A177871] The pharmacological effect of indometacin is not fully understood, however, it is thought to be mediated through potent and nonselective inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), which is the main enzyme responsible for catalyzes the rate-limiting step in prostaglandin and thromboxane biosynthesis via the arachidonic acid (AA) pathway. Indometacin was first discovered in 1963 and it was first approved for use in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration in 1965, [A486] along with other acetic acid derivatives such as [diclofenac] and [sulindac] that were also developed during the 1960s.[A177871] Since then, indometacin has been extensively studied in clinical trials as one of the most potent NSAIDs in blocking prostaglandin synthesis and was among the first NSAIDs to be used in the symptomatic treatment of migraine and for headaches that eventually became known as “indomethacin-responsive�?headache disorders.[A177871]     Most commonly used in rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritis, acute shoulder pains, and acute gouty arthritis, indometacin is currently available as oral capsules as well as other methods of administration, including rectal and intravenous formulations. Intravenous indometacin is administered to close a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus, as indicated by clinical evidence, in premature infants.[L10553] Ophthalmic indometacin has been studied and used in the symptomatic treatment of postoperative ocular inflammation and pain and/or complications after cataract surgery. Although deemed effective in reducing ocular inflammation in clinical studies, topical NSAIDs were also associated with a potential reduction in corneal sensitivity accompanied by an increased risk of superficial punctate keratitis and subjective symptoms of discomfort, including pain, burning or pricking, or a tingling sensation after instillation into the cul‐de‐sac.[A177949]Indometacin is an NSAID with analgesic and antipyretic properties that exerts its pharmacological effects by inhibiting the synthesis of factors involved in pain, fever, and inflammation. Its therapeutic action does not involve pituitary-adrenal stimulation.[L6778] Indometacin primarily works by suppressing inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis by providing relief of pain as well as reducing fever, swelling, and tenderness. This effectiveness has been demonstrated by a reduction in the extent of joint swelling, the average number of joints displaying symptoms of inflammation, and the severity of morning stiffness. Increased mobility was demonstrated by a decrease in total walking time and by improved functional capability seen as an increase in grip strength.[L6778] In clinical trials, indometacin was shown to be effective in relieving the pain, reducing the fever, swelling, redness, and tenderness of acute gouty arthritis. Due to its pharmacological actions, the use of indometacin is associated with the risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke, as well as gastrointestinal effects such as bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines.[L6778]    In a study of healthy individuals, acute oral and intravenous indometacin therapy resulted in a transiently diminished basal and CO2 stimulated cerebral blood flow; this effect disappeared in one study after one week of oral treatment.[L6778] The clinical significance of this effect has not been established. Compared to other NSAIDs, it is suggested that indometacin is a more potent vasoconstrictor that is more consistent in decreasing cerebral blood flow and inhibiting CO2 reactivity.[A177871] There have been studies that show indometacin directly inhibiting neuronal activity to some extent in the trigeminocervical complex after either superior salivatory nucleus or dural stimulation.[A177871]Indometacin is a nonspecific and reversible inhibitor of the cyclo-oxygenase (COX) enzyme or prostaglandin G/H synthase. There are two identified isoforms of COX: COX-1 is universally present in most body tissues and is involved in the synthesis of the prostaglandins and thromboxane A2, while COX-2 is expressed in response to injury or inflammation.[A177871] Constitutively expressed, the COX-1 enzyme is involved in gastric mucosal protection, platelet, and kidney function by catalyzing the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin (PG) G2 and PGG2 to PGH2.[A177871] COX-2 is constitutively expressed and highly inducible by inflammatory stimuli. It is found in the central nervous system, kidneys, uterus, and other organs. COX-2 also catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to PGG2 and PGG2 to PGH2. In the COX-2-mediated pathway, PGH2 is further converted to PGE2 and PGI2 (also known as prostacyclin). PGE2 is involved in mediating inflammation, pain, and fever. Decreasing levels of PGE2 leads to reduced inflammatory reactions. Indometacin is known to inhibit both isoforms of COX, however, with greater selectivity for COX-1, which accounts for its increased adverse gastric effects relative to other NSAIDs. It binds to the enzyme's active site and prevents the interaction between the enzyme and its substrate, arachidonic acid. Indometacin, unlike other NSAIDs, also inhibits phospholipase A2, the enzyme responsible for releasing arachidonic acid from phospholipids. The analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects of indomethacin as well as adverse reactions associated with the drug occur as a result of decreased prostaglandin synthesis. Its antipyretic effects may be due to action on the hypothalamus, resulting in increased peripheral blood flow, vasodilation, and subsequent heat dissipation.    The exact mechanism of action of indometacin in inducing closure of a patent ductus arteriosus is not fully understood; however, it is thought to be through inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis.[L6778] At birth, the ductus arteriosus is normally closed as the tension of the oxygen increases significantly after birth.[A177880] Patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants is associated with congenital heart malformations where PGE1 mediates an opposite effect to that of oxygen. PGE1 dilates the ductus arteriosus through smooth muscle relaxation and prevents the closure of the ductus arteriosus.[A177880] By inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins, indometacin promotes the closure of ductus arteriosus.[L10553]    Indometacin has been described as possessing anticancer and antiviral properties through activation of protein kinase R (PKR) and downstream phosphorylation of eIF2α, inhibiting protein synthesis.[A234429, A234434]"

166,"**Metformin immediate-release formulations**     Metformin is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults and pediatric patients �?0 years old with type 2 diabetes mellitus.[L40243]    **Metformin extended-release tablet (XR)**    The extended-release formulation of metformin is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Safety in children has not been determined to this date.[L12207]    **Metformin combination products**    Metformin is a component of a variety of combination products with other anti-diabetic agents. [L11419]Metformin is a biguanide antihyperglycemic agent and first-line pharmacotherapy used in the management of type II diabetes.[L12207,A176173]     Metformin is considered an antihyperglycemic drug because it lowers blood glucose concentrations in type II diabetes without causing hypoglycemia. It is commonly described as an ""insulin sensitizer"", leading to a decrease in insulin resistance and a clinically significant reduction of plasma fasting insulin levels.[A176173] Another well-known benefit of this drug is modest weight loss, making it an effective choice for obese patients type II diabetes.[A36559]    Metformin was first approved in Canada in 1972,[A36552] and received subsequent FDA approval in the US in 1995.[L12207]**General effects**    Insulin is an important hormone that regulates blood glucose levels.[T514] Type II diabetes is characterized by a decrease in sensitivity to insulin, resulting in elevations in blood glucose when the pancreas can no longer compensate. In patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, insulin is unable to exert adequate effects on tissues and cells (i.e. insulin resistance)[T514] and insulin deficiency may also be present.[L5753]    Metformin reduces hepatic production of glucose, decreases the intestinal absorption of glucose, and enhances insulin sensitivity by increasing both peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. In contrast with drugs of the sulfonylurea class, which lead to hyperinsulinemia, the secretion of insulin is unchanged with metformin use.[L12207]    **Effect on fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c)**    HbA1c is an important periodic measure of glycemic control used to monitor diabetic patients. Fasting plasma glucose is also a useful and important measure of glycemic control. In a 29-week clinical trial of subjects diagnosed with type II diabetes, metformin decreased the fasting plasma glucose levels by an average of 59 mg/dL from baseline, compared to an average increase of 6.3 mg/dL from baseline in subjects taking a placebo.[L12207]  Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was decreased by about 1.4% in subjects receiving metformin, and increased by 0.4% in subjects receiving placebo only.[L12207]Metformin's mechanisms of action are unique from other classes of oral antihyperglycemic drugs. Metformin decreases blood glucose levels by decreasing hepatic glucose production (also called gluconeogenesis), decreasing the intestinal absorption of glucose, and increasing insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.[L12207] It is well established that metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I activity, and it has since been generally postulated that its potent antidiabetic effects occur through this mechanism.[A36534, A36557]   The above processes lead to a decrease in blood glucose, managing type II diabetes and exerting positive effects on glycemic control.    After ingestion, the organic cation transporter-1 (OCT1) is responsible for the uptake of metformin into hepatocytes (liver cells). As this drug is positively charged, it accumulates in cells and in the mitochondria because of the membrane potentials across the plasma membrane as well as the mitochondrial inner membrane. Metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I, preventing the production of mitochondrial ATP leading to increased cytoplasmic ADP:ATP and AMP:ATP ratios.[A36534] These changes activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an enzyme that plays an important role in the regulation of glucose metabolism.[A176348] Aside from this mechanism, AMPK can be activated by a lysosomal mechanism involving other activators.  Following this process, increases in AMP:ATP ratio also inhibit _fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase_ enzyme, resulting in the inhibition of gluconeogenesis, while also inhibiting _adenylate cyclase_ and decreasing the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP),[A36534] a derivative of ATP used for cell signaling [A176351]. Activated AMPK phosphorylates two isoforms of acetyl-CoA carboxylase enzyme, thereby inhibiting fat synthesis and leading to fat oxidation, reducing hepatic lipid stores and increasing liver sensitivity to insulin.[A36534]     In the intestines, metformin increases anaerobic glucose metabolism in enterocytes (intestinal cells), leading to reduced net glucose uptake and increased delivery of lactate to the liver. Recent studies have also implicated the gut as a primary site of action of metformin and suggest that the liver may not be as important for metformin action in patients with type 2 diabetes. Some of the ways metformin may play a role on the intestines is by promoting the metabolism of glucose by increasing glucagon-like peptide I (GLP-1) as well as increasing gut utilization of glucose.[A36534]     In addition to the above pathway, the mechanism of action of metformin may be explained by other ways, and its exact mechanism of action has been under extensive study in recent years.[A36535, A36554, A36555, A36557]"
167,"Methadone is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. It's recommended that use is reserved for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (eg, nonopioid analgesics, opioid combination products) are ineffective, not tolerated, or would be otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain.[F4688]    Methadone is also indicated for detoxification treatment of opioid addiction (heroin or other morphine-like drugs), and for maintenance substitution treatment for opioid dependence in adults in conjunction with appropriate social and medical services.[F4685,F4691]Methadone is a potent synthetic analgesic that works as a full µ-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. As a full MOR agonist, methadone mimics the natural effects of the body's opioids, endorphins, and enkephalins through the release of neurotransmitters involved in pain transmission. It also has a number of unique characteristics that have led to its increased use in the last two decades; in particular, methadone has a lower risk of neuropsychiatric toxicity compared to other opioids (due to a lack of active metabolites), minimal accumulation in renal failure, good bioavailability, low cost, and a long duration of action.[F4685,F4688,F4691,A185885,A185900,A185903]     Due to its unique mechanism of action, methadone is particularly useful for the management of hard to treat pain syndromes such as neuropathic pain and cancer pain requiring higher and more frequent doses of shorter-acting opioids.[A185888,A185891,A185897] Compared with [morphine], the gold standard reference opioid, methadone also acts as an agonist of κ- and σ-opioid receptors, as an antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, and as an inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine uptake.[A497,A5344] Specifically by inhibiting the NMDA receptor, methadone dampens a major excitatory pain pathway within the central nervous system.[A185876] Compared to other opioids, methadone's effects on NMDA inhibition may explain it's improved analgesic efficacy and reduced opioid tolerance.[A185891,A185894]    Methadone shares similar effects and risks of other opioids such as [morphine], [hydromorphone], [oxycodone], and [fentanyl]. However, it also has a unique pharmacokinetic profile. Compared with short-acting and even extended-release formulations of [morphine], methadone displays a comparatively longer duration of action and half-life. These effects make methadone a good option for the treatment of severe pain and addiction as fewer doses are needed to maintain analgesia and prevent opioid withdrawal symptoms. However, methadone also has an unpredictable half-life with interindividual variability, which leads to an unpredictable risk of respiratory depression and overdose when initiating or titrating therapy.[A183995]    Overall, methadone's pharmacological actions result in analgesia, suppression of opioid withdrawal symptoms, sedation, miosis, sweating, hypotension, bradycardia, nausea and vomiting (via binding within the chemoreceptor trigger zone), and constipation. At higher doses, methadone use can result in respiratory depression, overdose, and death.[F4685,F4688,F4691]    Treatment of opioid addiction with methadone, [buprenorphine], or slow-release oral [morphine] (SROM) is termed Opioid Agonist Treatment (OAT) or Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST). The intention of substitution of illicit opioids with the long-acting opioids used in OAT is to prevent withdrawal symptoms for 24-36 hours following dosing to ultimately reduce cravings and drug-seeking behaviours. Use of OAT is also intended to lead to social stabilization by reducing crime rates, incarceration, use of illicit opioids such as [heroin] or [fentanyl], and ultimately marginalization.[A185882] Illegally purchased opioids present many other harms in addition to overdose as they can be injected and may be laced with other substances that increase the risk of harm or overdose. Provision of OAT is often combined with education about harm reduction including use of clean needles and injection supplies in an effort to reduce the risks associated with injection drug use such as contraction of HIV and Hepatitis C and other complications including skin infections, abscesses, or endocarditis.Overall, methadone's pharmacological actions result in analgesia, suppression of opioid withdrawal symptoms, sedation, miosis (through binding to receptors in the pupillary muscles), sweating, hypotension, bradycardia, nausea and vomiting (via binding within the chemoreceptor trigger zone), and constipation. Like many basic drugs, methadone also enters mast cells and releases histamine by a non-immunological mechanism leading to flushing, pruritus, and urticaria, which can commonly be misattributed to an allergic reaction.     Compared to other opioids, methadone has fewer active metabolites and therefore a lower risk of neuropsychiatric toxicity. This means that higher doses needed to manage severe pain or addiction are less likely to result in delirium, hyperalgesia, or seizures.[A185900,A185903]    Similar to morphine, both methadone isomers are 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists, although l-methadone produces greater inhibition than d-methadone.     Methadone's effects are reversible by naloxone with a pA2 value similar to its antagonism of morphine.[F4685,F4688,F4691]      **Dependence and Tolerance**    As with other opioids, tolerance and physical dependence may develop upon repeated administration of methadone and there is a potential for development of psychological dependence. Physical dependence and tolerance reflect the neuroadaptation of the opioid receptors to chronic exposure to an opioid and are separate and distinct from abuse and addiction. Tolerance, as well as physical dependence, may develop upon repeated administration of opioids, and are not by themselves evidence of an addictive disorder or abuse.    Patients on prolonged therapy should be tapered gradually from the drug if it is no longer required for pain control. Withdrawal symptoms may occur following abrupt discontinuation of therapy or upon administration of an opioid antagonist. Some of the symptoms that may be associated with abrupt withdrawal of an opioid analgesic include body aches, diarrhea, gooseflesh, loss of appetite, nausea, nervousness or restlessness, anxiety, runny nose, sneezing, tremors or shivering, stomach cramps, tachycardia, trouble with sleeping, unusual increase in sweating, palpitations, unexplained fever, weakness and yawning.[F4685,F4688,F4691]      **Cardiac Conduction Effects**    Laboratory studies, both in vivo and in vitro, have demonstrated that methadone inhibits cardiac potassium channels and prolongs the QT interval. Cases of QT interval prolongation and serious arrhythmia (torsades de pointes) have been observed during treatment with methadone. These cases appear to be more commonly associated with, but not limited to, higher dose treatment (> 200 mg/day). Methadone should be administered with particular caution to patients already at risk for development of prolonged QT interval (e.g., cardiac hypertrophy, concomitant diuretic use, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia). Careful monitoring is recommended when using methadone in patients with a history of cardiac conduction disease, those taking medications affecting cardiac conduction, and in other cases where history or physical exam suggest an increased risk of dysrhythmia.[F4685,F4688,F4691]      **Respiratory Depression and Overdose**    Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of methadone. Patients should be  monitored for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of methadone or following a dose increase.    Respiratory depression is of particular concern in elderly or debilitated patients as well as in those suffering from conditions accompanied by hypoxia or hypercapnia when even moderate therapeutic doses may dangerously decrease pulmonary ventilation. Methadone should be administered with extreme caution to patients with conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or decreased respiratory reserve such as: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, severe obesity, sleep apnea syndrome, myxedema, kyphoscoliosis, and CNS depression or coma. In these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of methadone may decrease respiratory drive while simultaneously increasing airway resistance to the point of apnea. Alternative, non-opioid analgesics should be considered, and methadone should be employed only under careful medical supervision at the lowest effective dose.    Infants exposed in-utero or through breast milk are at risk of life-threatening respiratory depression upon delivery or when nursed.     Methadone's peak respiratory depressant effects typically occur later, and persist longer than its peak analgesic effects, in the short-term use setting. These characteristics can contribute to cases of iatrogenic overdose, particularly during treatment initiation and dose titration.[F4685,F4688,F4691]      **Head Injury and Increased Intracranial Pressure**    The respiratory depressant effects of opioids and their capacity to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, other intracranial lesions or a pre-existing increase in intracranial pressure. Furthermore, opioids produce effects which may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injuries. In such patients, methadone must be used with caution, and only if it is deemed essential.[F4685,F4688,F4691]      **Incomplete Cross-tolerance between Methadone and other Opioids**    Patients tolerant to other opioids may be incompletely tolerant to methadone. Incomplete cross-tolerance is of particular concern for patients tolerant to other µ-opioid agonists who are being converted to methadone, thus making the determination of dosing during opioid conversion complex. Deaths have been reported during conversion from chronic, high-dose treatment with other opioid agonists. A high degree of “opioid tolerance�?does not eliminate the possibility of methadone overdose, iatrogenic or otherwise.[F4685,F4688,F4691]    Crosstolerance between morphine and methadone has been demonstrated, as steady-state plasma methadone concentrations required for effectiveness (C50%) were higher in abstinent rats previously dosed with morphine, as compared to controls.      **Misuse, Abuse, and Diversion of Opioids**    Methadone is a mu-agonist opioid with an abuse liability similar to morphine. Methadone, like morphine and other opioids used for analgesia, has the potential for being abused and is subject to criminal diversion.    Methadone can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or illicit. This should be considered when dispensing Methadone in situations where the clinician is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion.[F4685,F4688,F4691]      **Hypotensive Effect**    The administration of methadone may result in severe hypotension in patients whose ability to maintain normal blood pressure is compromised (e.g., severe volume depletion).[F4685,F4688,F4691]      **Gastrointestinal Effects**    Methadone and other morphine-like opioids have been shown to decrease bowel motility and cause constipation. This primarily occurs through agonism of opioid receptors in the gut wall. Methadone may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions.[F4685,F4688,F4691]      **Sexual Function/Reproduction**    Reproductive function in human males may be decreased by methadone treatment. Reductions in ejaculate volume and seminal vesicle and prostate secretions have been reported in methadone-treated individuals. In addition, reductions in serum testosterone levels and sperm motility, and abnormalities in sperm morphology have been reported. Long-term use of opioids may be associated with decreased sex hormone levels and symptoms such as low libido, erectile dysfunction, or infertility.[F4685,F4688,F4691]Methadone is a synthetic opioid analgesic with full agonist activity at the µ-opioid receptor. While agonism of the µ-opioid receptor is the primary mechanism of action for the treatment of pain, methadone also acts as an agonist of κ- and σ-opioid receptors within the central and peripheral nervous systems. Interestingly, methadone differs from [morphine] (which is considered the gold standard reference opioid) in its antagonism of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and its strong inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine uptake, which likely also contributes to its antinociceptive activity.[A497]     Methadone is administered as a 50:50 racemic mixture of (R)- and (S)-stereoisomers, with (R)-methadone demonstrating ~10-fold higher affinity and potency for the µ-opioid receptor than the (S) stereoisomer.[A497] The analgesic activity of the racemate is almost entirely due to the (R)-isomer, while the (S)-isomer lacks significant respiratory depressant activity but does have antitussive effects.    While methadone shares similar effects and risks of other opioids such as [morphine], [hydromorphone], [oxycodone], and [fentanyl] it has a number of unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that distinguish it from them and make it a useful agent for the treatment of opioid addiction. For example, methadone abstinence syndrome, although qualitatively similar to that of morphine, differs in that the onset is slower, the course is more prolonged, and the symptoms are less severe."
168,"Olanzapine was initially used orally and intramuscularly for the chronic treatment of schizophrenia in patients over 13 years old and other psychiatric disorders such as bipolar I disorder including mixed or manic episodes.[A177014]     Olanzapine is also indicated, in combination with lithium or valproate for the short-term treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in adults.[A177014]    Olanzapine is also approved for the management of psychomotor agitation associated with schizophrenia and bipolar I mania.[FDA label]    Schizophrenia is a complex biochemical brain disorder that affects the person's ability to differentiate reality. It is usually observed as the presence of delusions, hallucinations, social withdrawal and disturbed thinking.[L5936]    Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition defined by periods of extreme mood disturbances. It is categorized in different types from which type 1 is known to involve episodes of severe mania and often depression while type 2 presents less severe forms of mania.[L5939]    Olanzapine is also indicated in combination with [samidorphan] for the treatment of bipolar I disorder, either as an adjunct to lithium or valproate or as monotherapy for the acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes or as maintenance therapy, and for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults.[L34359]Olanzapine is a thienobenzodiazepine classified as an atypical or second-generation antipsychotic agent.[A176996] The second-generation antipsychotics were introduced in the 90s and quickly gained traction due to their impressive efficacy, reduced risk for extrapyramidal side effects and reduced susceptibility to drug-drug interactions.[A177011] Olanzapine very closely resembles [clozapine] and only differs by two additional methyl groups and the absence of a chloride moiety.[T554] It was discovered by scientists at Eli Lilly and approved to be marketed in the US in 1996.[T548]The effect of olanzapine in the D2 receptor is reported to produce the positive effects of this drug such as a decrease in hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, disorganized thought, and disorganized behavior. On the other hand, its effect on the serotonin 5HT2A receptor prevents the onset of anhedonia, flat affect, alogia, avolition and poor attention.[A177014] Based on the specific mechanism of action, olanzapine presents a higher affinity for the dopamine D2 receptor when compared to the rest of the dopamine receptor isotypes. This characteristic significantly reduces the presence of side effects.[T554]    Clinical trials for the original use of olanzapine demonstrated significant effectiveness in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in adults and acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar disorder in adolescents.[A177008]    The effect of olanzapine on dopamine and serotonin receptors has been suggested to reduce chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting as those receptors are suggested to be involved in this process. For this effect, several clinical trials have been conducted and it has been shown that olanzapine can produce a significant increase in total control of nausea and vomiting.[A176993] In a high-level study of the effect of olanzapine for this condition, a complete response on the delay phase was observed in 84% of the individual and control of emesis of over 80% despite the phase.[A176999]The activity of olanzapine is achieved by the antagonism of multiple neuronal receptors including the dopamine receptor D1, D2, D3 and D4 in the brain, the serotonin receptors 5HT2A, 5HT2C, 5HT3 and 5HT6, the alpha-1 adrenergic receptor, the histamine receptor H1 and multiple muscarinic receptors.[A176993, A176999]    As abovementioned, olanzapine presents a wide profile of targets, however, its antagonistic effect towards the dopamine D2 receptor in the mesolimbic pathway is key as it blocks dopamine from having a potential action at the post-synaptic receptor. The binding of olanzapine to the dopamine D2 receptors is easily dissociable and hence, it allows for a certain degree of dopamine neurotransmission.[A177014]    On the other hand, olanzapine acts in the serotonin 5HT2A receptors in the frontal cortex in a similar manner than the reported on dopamine D2 receptors. This determined effect allows for a decrease in adverse effects.[A177014]"
169,"**Indicated** for:[label]    1) Management of hypertension alone and in combination with other antihypertensives.    2) Management of angina pectoris associated with coronary atherosclerosis.    3) Management of acute myocardial infarction in hemodynamically stable patients with a heart rate greater than 50 beats per minutes and a systolic blood pressure above 100 mmHg.    **Off-label** uses include:    1) Secondary prevention of myocardial infarction.[A178156]    2) Management of heart failure.[A178153]    3) Management of atrial fibrillation.[A178141]    4) Management of supraventricular tachycardia.[A178162]    5) Management of ventricular arrythmias such as congenital long-QT and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.[A178147]    7) Prophylaxis of migraine headaches.[A178171]    8) Management of alcohol withdrawal.[A178174,A178177]Atenolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker used in a variety of cardiovascular conditions.     Sir James Black, a Scottish pharmacologist, pioneered the use of beta-blockers for the management of angina pectoris in 1958 for which he received the Nobel Prize.[A178429] Beta-blockers quickly became popular in clinical use and where subsequently investigated for use in myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, and hypertension during the 1960s. Later they continued to be investigated for use in heart failure throughout the 1970-1980s. Atenolol itself was developed early on in this history by Alvogen Malta under the trade name Tenormin and received FDA approval in September, 1981.[label]    Despite being one of the most widely prescribed beta blockers, evidence suggests atenolol may not significantly reduce mortality, and only modestly reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with hypertension.[A235850,A235855] A Cochrane review of patients being treated for primary hypertension shows that atenolol shows a risk ratio of 0.88 for cardiovascular disease risk and a risk ratio of 0.99 for mortality.[A235850,A235855] Similar results have been found in other meta-analyses.[A235860,A235865] A meta-analysis of over 145,000 patients showed the risk of stroke in patients taking atenolol may depend on the age of the patient.[A235865] The use of atenolol may need to be based on more patient factors than hypertension alone.[A235850,A235855,A235860,A235865]Atenolol is a cardio-selective beta-blocker and as such exerts most of its effects on the heart.[label] It acts as an antagonist to sympathetic innervation and prevents increases in heart rate, electrical conductivity, and contractility in the heart due to increased release of norepinephrine from the peripheral nervous system.[label,T116,A178258] Together the decreases in contractility and rate produce a reduction in cardiac output resulting in a compensatory increase in peripheral vascular resistance in the short-term. This response later declines to baseline with long-term use of atenolol. More importantly, this reduction in the work demanded of the myocardium also reduces oxygen demand which provides therapeutic benefit by reducing the mismatch of oxygen supply and demand in settings where coronary blood flow is limited, such as in coronary atherosclerosis. Reducing oxygen demand, particularly due to exercise, can reduce the frequency of angina pectoris symptoms and potentially improve survival of the remaining myocardium after myocardial infarction. The decrease in rate of sinoatrial node potentials, electrical conduction, slowing of potentials traveling through the atrioventricular node, and reduced frequency of ectopic potentials due to blockade of adrenergic beta receptors has led to benefit in arrhythmic conditions such as atrial fibrillation by controlling the rate of action potential generation and allowing for more effective coordinated contractions. Since a degree of sympathetic activity is necessary to maintain cardiac function, the reduced contractility induced by atenolol may precipitate or worsen heart failure, especially during volume overload.[label]    The effects of atenolol on blood pressure have been established, although it is less effective than alternative beta-blockers, but the mechanism has not yet been characterized.[label,T116] As a β1 selective drug, it does not act via the vasodilation produced by non-selective agents.[T116] Despite this there is a sustained reduction in peripheral vascular resistance, and consequently blood pressure, alongside a decrease in cardiac output. It is thought that atenolol's antihypertensive activity may be related to action on the central nervous system (CNS) or it's inhibition of the renin-aldosterone-angiotensin system rather than direct effects on the vasculature.[label]    Atenolol produces CNS effects similar to other beta-blockers, but does so to a lesser extent due to reduces ability to cross the blood-brain barrier.[T116] It has the potential to produce fatigue, depression, and sleep disturbances such as nightmares or insomnia.[label,T116] The exact mechanisms behind these have not been characterized but their occurrence must be considered as they represent clinically relevant adverse effects.    Atenolol exerts some effects on the respiratory system although to a much lesser extent than non-selective beta-blockers.[label] Interaction with β2 receptors in the airways can produce bronchoconstriction by blocking the relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle mediated by the sympathetic nervous system.[T116] The same action can interfere with β-agonist therapies used in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.[label,A178258,T116]    Unlike some other beta-blocker drugs, atenolol does not have intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilizing activity nor does it produce changes in glycemic control.[label]Atenolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker, called such because it selectively binds to the β1-adrenergic receptor as an antagonist up to a reported 26 fold more than β2 receptors.[A178372] Selective activity at the β1 receptor produces cardioselectivity due to the higher population of this receptor in cardiac tissue. Some binding to β2 and possibly β3 receptors can still occur at therapeutic dosages but the effects mediated by antagonizing these are significantly reduced from those of non-selective agents. β1 and β2 receptors are G<sub>s</sub> coupled therefore antagonism of their activation reduces activity of adenylyl cyclase and its downstream signalling via cyclic adenosime monophosphate and protein kinase A (PKA).     In cardiomyocytes PKA is thought to mediate activation of L-type calcium channels and ryanodine receptors through their phosphorylation.[A178396] L-type calcium channels can then provide an initial rise in intracellular calcium and trigger the ryanodine receptors to release calcium stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and increased contractility. PKA also plays a role in the cessation of contraction by phosphorylating phospholamban which in turn increases the affinity of SR Ca2+ATPase to increase reuptake of calcium into the SR. It also phophorylates troponin I to reduce affinity of the protein for calcium. Both of these events lead to a reduction in contraction which, when coupled with the initial increase in contraction, allows for faster cycling and consequently higher heart rate with increased contractility. L-type calcium channels are also a major contributor to cardiac depolarization and their activation can increase frequency of action potentials and possibly the incidence of ectopic potentials.[A178405]     Similar inihibitory events occur in the bronchial smooth muscle to mediate relaxation including phosphorylation of myosin light-chain kinase, reducing its affinity for calcium.[A178408] PKA also inhibits the excitatory G<sub>q coupled pathway by phosphorylating the inositol trisphosphate receptor and phospholipase C resulting in inhibition of intracellular calcium release. Antagonism of this activity by beta-blocker agents like atenolol can thus cause increased bronchoconstriction.  "
170,"Omeprazole, according to the FDA label [FDA label] is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) used for the following purposes:    �?Treatment of active duodenal ulcer in adults     �?Eradication of Helicobacter pylori to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer  recurrence in adults     �?Treatment of active benign gastric ulcer in adults     �?Reduction of risk of upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding in critically ill adult patients.    �?Treatment of symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in  patients 1 year of age and older     �?Treatment of erosive esophagitis (EE) due to acid-mediated GERD in  patients 1 month of age and older     �?Maintenance of healing of EE due to acid-mediated GERD in patients 1  year of age and older     �?Pathologic hypersecretory conditions in adultsOriginally approved by the FDA in 1989, omeprazole is a _proton-pump inhibitor_, used to treat gastric acid-related disorders. These disorders may include gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease, and other diseases characterized by the oversecretion of gastric acid.  This drug was the first clinical useful drug in its class, and its approval was followed by the formulation of many other proton pump inhibitor drugs [A174232]. Omeprazole is generally effective and well-tolerated, promoting its popular use in children and adults [FDA label].**Effects on gastric acid secretion**    This drug decreases gastric acid secretion [FDA label]. After oral administration, the onset of the antisecretory effect of omeprazole is usually achieved within one hour, with the maximum effect occurring by 2 hours after administration. The inhibitory effect of omeprazole on acid secretion increases with repeated once-daily dosing, reaching a plateau after four days [FDA label].    **Effects on serum gastrin**    In studies of 200 or more patients, serum gastrin levels increased during the first 1-2 weeks of daily administration of therapeutic doses of omeprazole. This occurred in a parallel fashion with the inhibition of acid secretion. No further increase in serum gastrin occurred with continued omeprazole administration. Increased gastrin causes enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and increased serum Chromogranin A (CgA) levels. The increased CgA levels may lead to false positive results in diagnostic studies for neuroendocrine tumors [FDA label].    **Enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell effects**    Human gastric biopsy samples have been obtained from more than 3000 pediatric and adult patients treated with omeprazole in long-term clinical studies. The incidence of enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia in these studies increased with time; however, no case of ECL cell carcinoids, dysplasia, or neoplasia have been identified in these patients. These studies, however, are of insufficient in power and duration to draw conclusions on the possible influence of long-term administration of omeprazole in the development of any premalignant or malignant conditions [FDA label].     **Other effects**    Systemic effects of omeprazole in the central nervous system, cardiovascular and respiratory systems have not been found to date. Omeprazole, given in oral doses of 30 or 40 mg for 2-4 weeks, showed no effect on thyroid function, carbohydrate metabolism, or circulating levels of parathyroid hormone, cortisol, estradiol, testosterone, prolactin, cholecystokinin or secretin [FDA label].       Hydrochloric acid (HCl) secretion into the gastric lumen is a process regulated mainly by the H(+)/K(+)-ATPase of the proton pump [A175180], expressed in high quantities by the parietal cells of the stomach. ATPase is an enzyme on the parietal cell membrane that facilitates hydrogen and potassium exchange through the cell, which normally results in the extrusion of potassium and formation of HCl (gastric acid) [A174295].    Omeprazole is a member of a class of antisecretory compounds, the substituted _benzimidazoles_, that stop gastric acid secretion by selective inhibition of the _H+/K+ ATPase_ enzyme system. Proton-pump inhibitors such as omeprazole bind covalently to cysteine residues via disulfide bridges on the alpha subunit of the _H+/K+ ATPase_ pump, inhibiting gastric acid secretion for up to 36 hours [A175192].  This antisecretory effect is dose-related and leads to the inhibition of both basal and stimulated acid secretion, regardless of the stimulus [FDA label].      **Mechanism of H. pylori eradication**    Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is frequently associated with _Helicobacter pylori_ bacterial infection (NSAIDs) [A175195]. The treatment of H. pylori infection may include the addition of omeprazole or other proton pump inhibitors as part of the treatment regimen [FDA label], [A175198].   _H. pylori_ replicates most effectively at a neutral pH [A175213]. Acid inhibition in H. pylori eradication therapy, including proton-pump inhibitors such as omeprazole, raises gastric pH, discouraging the growth of H.pylori [A175198]. It is generally believed that proton pump inhibitors inhibit the _urease_ enzyme, which increases the pathogenesis of H. pylori in gastric-acid related conditions [A175216].   "
171,"For the initial treatment of active tuberculosis in adults and children when combined with other antituberculous agents.A pyrazine that is used therapeutically as an antitubercular agent.Pyrazinamide kills or stops the growth of certain bacteria that cause tuberculosis (TB). It is used with other drugs to treat tuberculosis. It is a highly specific agent and is active only against <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>. In vitro and in vivo, the drug is active only at a slightly acid pH. Pyrazinamie gets activated to Pyrazinoic acid in the bacilli where it interferes with fatty acid synthase FAS I. This interferes with the bacteriums ability to synthesize new fatty acids, required for growth and replication.Pyrazinamide diffuses into active _M. tuberculosis_ that express pyrazinamidase enzyme that converts pyrazinamide to the active form pyrazinoic acid. Pyrazinoic acid can leak out under acidic conditions to be converted to the protonated conjugate acid, which is readily diffused back into the bacilli and accumulate intracellularly. The net effect is that more pyrazinoic acid accumulates inside the bacillus at acid pH than at neutral pH. Pyrazinoic acid was thought to inhibit the enzyme fatty acid synthase (FAS) I, which is required by the bacterium to synthesise fatty acids. However, this theory was thought to have been discounted.[A512] However, further studies reproduced the results of FAS I inhibition as the putative mechanism first in whole cell assay of replicating M. tuberculosis bacilli which have shown that pyrazinoic acid and its ester inhibit the synthesis of fatty acids.[A513] This study was followed by in vitro assay of tuberculous FAS I enzyme that tested the activity with pyrazinamide, pyrazinoic acid and several classes of pyrazinamide analogs. Pyrazinamide and its analogs inhibited the activity of purified FAS I.[A514]     It has also been suggested that the accumulation of pyrazinoic acid disrupts membrane potential and interferes with energy production, necessary for survival of M. tuberculosis at an acidic site of infection. Pyrazinoic acid has also been shown to bind to the ribosomal protein S1 (RpsA) and inhibit trans-translation. This may explain the ability of the drug to kill dormant mycobacteria.[A515]"
172,"Used for the symptomatic treatment of parkinsonism.Metixene (or methixene) is a anticholinergic used as an antiparkinsonian agent.Metixene is a tertiary antimuscarinic with actions similar to those of atropine; it also has antihistaminic and direct antispasmodic properties. It is used for the symptomatic treatment of parkinsonism, including the alleviation of the extrapyramidal syndrome induced by other drugs such as phenothiazines, but, like other antimuscarinics, it is of no value against tardive dyskinesias. Metixene has been discontinued.Parkinsonism is thought to result from an imbalance between the excitatory (cholinergic) and inhibitory (dopaminergic) systems in the corpus striatum. The mechanism of action of centrally active anticholinergic drugs such as metixene is considered to relate to competitive antagonism of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors in the corpus striatum, which then restores the balance."
173,"For the treatment of allergic rhinitis, hay fever, and allergic skin disorders.In the U.S., Terfenadine was superseded by fexofenadine in the 1990s due to the risk of cardiac arrhythmia caused by QT interval prolongation.Terfenadine, an H1-receptor antagonist antihistamine, is similar in structure to astemizole and haloperidol, a butyrophenone antipsychotic. The active metabolite of terfenadine is fexofenadine.Terfenadine competes with histamine for binding at H1-receptor sites in the GI tract, uterus, large blood vessels, and bronchial muscle. This reversible binding of terfenadine to H1-receptors suppresses the formation of edema, flare, and pruritus resulting from histaminic activity. As the drug does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier, CNS depression is minimal."
174,"**Oral**    Indicated for the management of hypertension, to lower blood pressure, alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.[L10556]    Indicated for use to improve exercise tolerance in patients with chronic stable angina.[L10556]    Indicated for the management of variant angina (Prinzmetal's angina).[L6298]    **Intravenous**    Indicated for the short-term management of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter for temporary control of rapid ventricular rate.[L6292]    Indicated for the rapid conversion of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias (PSVT) to sinus rhythm. This includes AV nodal reentrant tachycardias and reciprocating tachycardias associated with an extranodal accessory pathway such as the WPW syndrome or short PR syndrome.[L6292]    **Off-label**    Indicated for off-label uses in anal fissures (as topical formulation), migraine prophylaxis, cramps in lower leg related to rest, pulmonary hypertension,[L6289] idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, and proteinuria associated with diabetic nephropathy.[L6298]Diltiazem is a benzothiazepine derivative with antihypertensive and vasodilating properties. Approved in 1982 by the FDA, it is a member of the non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers drug class. It works through various mechanisms of action, but it primarily works by inhibiting the calcium influx into cardiac and vascular smooth muscle during depolarization.[L10556] Compared to dihydropyridine drugs, such as [nifedipine], that preferentially act on vascular smooth muscle and [verapamil] that directly acts on the heart muscle, diltiazem displays an intermediate specificity to target both the cardiac and vascular smooth muscle.[T28] Being a potent vasodilator, diltiazem is used clinically as an antihypertensive, anti-arrhythmic, and as an anti-anginal agent [L6289] for the management of cardiovascular conditions such as hypertension, chronic stable angina, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter. Apart from its main FDA-approved indications, diltiazem has also been used for numerous off-label indications, such as anal fissures (in topical formulations), migraine prophylaxis, pulmonary hypertension, and rest-related cramps in the lower extremities.[L6289] Typically available in extended-release oral and intravenous formulations, diltiazem is marketed under various brand names with Cardizem and Tiazac being the most common ones.Diltiazem is an antihypertensive and vasodilating agent that works by relaxing the vascular muscle and reducing blood pressure. This is related to the long-term therapeutic effects, as lowering the blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions.[L10556] Diltiazem inhibits the influx of extracellular calcium ions across the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes during depolarization. Diltiazem is classified as a negative inotrope (decreased force) and negative chronotrope (decreased rate).[L6289] It is also considered a rate-control drug as it reduces heart rate.[A178432,T28] Diltiazem is exerts hemodynamic actions by reducing blood pressure, systemic vascular resistance, the rate-pressure product, and coronary vascular resistance while increasing coronary blood flow.[L6292] Diltiazem decreases sinoatrial and atrioventricular conduction in isolated tissues and has a negative inotropic effect in isolated preparations.[L10556] In supraventricular tachycardia, diltiazem prolongs AV nodal refractories.[L6292]    As the magnitude of blood pressure reduction is related to the degree of hypertension, the antihypertensive effect of diltiazem is most pronounced in individuals with hypertension. In a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, dose-response study involving patients with essential hypertension, there was a reduction in the diastolic blood pressure by 1.9, 5.4, 6.1, and 8.6 mmHg in the patients receiving diltiazem at doses of 120, 240, 360, and 540 mg, respectively. In patients receiving placebo, there was a reduction in the diastolic blood pressure by 2.6 mmHg.In a randomized, double-blind study involving patients with chronic stable angina, variable doses of diltiazem administered at night all caused an increased exercise tolerance in the after 21 hours, compared to placebo.[L10556] In the NORDIL study of patients with hypertension, the therapeutic effectiveness of diltiazem in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality was assessed.[A178432] When using the combined primary endpoint as fatal and non-fatal stroke, myocardial infarction, and other cardiovascular death, fatal and non-fatal stroke was shown to be reduced by 25% in the diltiazem group. Although the clinical significance to this effect remains unclear, it is suggested that diltiazem may exert a protective role against cerebral stroke in hypertensive patients.[A178432] Excitation of cardiac muscle involves the activation of a slow calcium inward current that is induced by L-type slow calcium channels, which are voltage-sensitive, ion-selective channels[A178444] associated with a high activation threshold and slow inactivation profile.[T28] L-type calcium channels are the main current responsible for the late phase of the pacemaker potential.[A178492] Acting as the main Ca2+ source for contraction in smooth and cardiac muscle, activation of L-type calcium channels allows the influx of calcium ions into the muscles upon depolarization and excitation of the channel.[A178444] It is proposed that this cation influx may also trigger the release of additional calcium ions from intracellular storage sites.[A178444] Diltiazem is a slow calcium channel blocker that binds to the extracellular site of the alpha-1C subunit of the channel, which is thought to be the S5-6 linker region of the transmembrane domain IV and/or S6 segment of domain III.[A178492]  Diltiazem can get access to this binding site from either the intracellular or extracellular side, but it requires a voltage-induced conformational changes in the membrane.[A178492] Diltiazem inhibits the influx of extracellular calcium across the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes.[L10556] In isolated human atrial and ventricular myocardium, diltiazem suppressed tension over the range of membrane potentials associated with calcium channel activity but had little effect on the tension-voltage relations at more positive potentials.[A178453] This effect is thought to be mediated by the voltage-dependent block of the L-type calcium channels and inhibition of calcium ion release from the ER stores, without altering the sodium-calcium coupled transport or calcium sensitivity of myofilaments.[A178453] Through inhibition of inward calcium current, diltiazem exerts a direct ionotropic and energy sparing effect on the myocardium.[A178444] Diltiazem fslows atrioventricular nodal conduction, which is due to its ability to impede slow channel function.[A178444]    Reduced intracellular calcium concentrations equate to increased smooth muscle relaxation resulting in arterial vasodilation and therefore, decreased blood pressure.[L6289] The decrease in intracellular calcium inhibits the contractile processes of the myocardial smooth muscle cells, causing dilation of the coronary and systemic arteries, increased oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue, decreased total peripheral resistance, decreased systemic blood pressure, and decreased afterload.[L6289,L10556] Through its actions on reducing calcium levels in cardiac and vascular smooth muscles, diltiazem causes a reduction in the contractile processes of the myocardial smooth muscle cells and vasodilation of the coronary and systemic arteries, including epicardial and subendocardial. This subsequently leads to increased oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue, improved cardiac output due to increased stroke volume, decreased total peripheral resistance, decreased systemic blood pressure and heart rate, and decreased afterload.[L6289,L10556] Diltiazem lowers myocardial oxygen demand through a reduction in heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac contractility; this leads to a therapeutic effect in improving exercise tolerance in chronic stable angina.[A178432,L6289] "
175,"For the treatment of depression. Protriptyline hydrochloride is a dibenzocycloheptene-derivative tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). TCAs are structurally similar to phenothiazines. They contain a tricyclic ring system with an alkyl amine substituent on the central ring. In non-depressed individuals, protriptyline does not affect mood or arousal, but may cause sedation. In depressed individuals, protriptyline exerts a positive effect on mood. TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. In addition, TCAs down-regulate cerebral cortical &beta;-adrenergic receptors and sensitize post-synaptic serotonergic receptors with chronic use. The antidepressant effects of TCAs are thought to be due to an overall increase in serotonergic neurotransmission. TCAs also block histamine H1 receptors, alpha1-adrenergic receptors and muscarinic receptors, which accounts for their sedative, hypotensive and anticholinergic effects (e.g. blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention), respectively.Protriptyline may be used for the treatment of depression.Protriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant. It was thought that tricyclic antidepressants work by inhibiting the reuptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin by nerve cells. The effectiveness of antidepressants appear after approximately two weeks following recommended adminsitration schedule. Gradual changes are thought to occur in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, involved in emotion regulation as part of the limbic system, as receptor sensitivity is enhanced. While &alpha;and &beta;1 receptors are sensitized, &alpha;2 receptors are desensitized (leading to increased noradrenaline production). Tricyclics are also reported to alter the perceptions of pain, including neuropathic or neuralgic pain, so they may exhibit analgesic properties. The mechanism of action behind this analgesic property is not fully understood; however, it is thought to involve modulation of endogenous opioid systems in the CNS via an indirect serotonergic route. Tricyclic antidepressants are also effective in relieving migraine prophylaxis, but not in abortion of acute migraine attack, potentially via their serotonergic effects. Protriptyline acts by decreasing the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin (5-HT)."
176,"Alfuzosin is used to treat the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).[L9251] Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) refers to a benign growth or hyperplasia of the prostate and leads to lower urinary tract symptoms in men, such as urgency, frequency and changes to urine flow. The prevalence of BPH is as high as 50%-60% for males in their 60's, and this prevalence increases to 80%-90% of those over 70.[A228483] Alfuzosin is an alpha-1 adrenergic blocker used in the symptomatic treatment of BPH that works by relaxing the muscles in the prostate and bladder neck.[L31593] It was initially approved by the FDA in 2003 and is marketed by several pharmaceutical companies.[L9251]By selectively inhibiting alpha adrenergic receptors in the lower urinary tract, alfuzosin causes smooth muscle relaxation in the bladder neck and prostate, improving urine flow, thereby reducing BPH symptoms.[L9251] Additionally, alfuzosin reduces the vasoconstrictor effect of catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine), leading to peripheral vasodilation.[L31618] This leads to a risk of postural hypotension/syncope, and prescribing information warns that caution should be exercised in patients who take nitrates, antihypertensives, or have experienced decreased blood pressure after using other medications.[L9251]Alpha(1)-adrenoreceptors  are found in the prostate, bladder base, bladder neck, prostatic capsule, and prostatic urethra; their activation may lead to contraction of smooth muscle and urinary symptoms in patients with BPH.[A180688,L9251] Alfuzosin selectively binds to and inhibits alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors in the lower urinary tract.[A518] This leads to the relaxation of smooth muscle in both the prostate and bladder neck, resulting in the improvement in urine flow and a reduction of urinary symptoms.[L9251]"
177,"Used in the control of absence (petit mal) seizures that are refractory to treatment with other medications.An anticonvulsant effective in absence seizures, but generally reserved for refractory cases because of its toxicity. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1994, p378)Paramethadione and trimethadione are anticonvulsants indicated in the control of absence (petit mal) seizures that are refractory to treatment with other medications. Dione anticonvulsants are used in the treatment of epilepsy. They act on the central nervous system (CNS) to reduce the number of seizures.Dione anticonvulsants reduce T-type calcium currents in thalamic neurons, including thalamic relay neurons. It does so via the inhibition of voltage dependent T-type calcium channels. This raises the threshold for repetitive activity in the thalamus, and inhibits corticothalamic transmission. Thus, the abnormal thalamocortical rhythmicity, which is thought to underlie the 3-Hz spike-and-wave discharge seen on electroencephalogram(EEG) with absence seizures, is dampened."
178,"Clobazam is indicated for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients 2 years of age or older.[L44888] Clobazam belongs to the 1,5-benzodiazepine class of drugs and is marketed under different names, Onfi, Frisium, Urbanyl, and others.[A256868]. Clobazam was first synthesized in 1966 and first published in 1969, following the incidental synthesis and discovery of the first benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide in the 1950s.[A256913] Unlike older 1,4-benzodiazepines, clobazam has a better side-effects profile, particularly less sedative and amnesic effects.[A256963,A256868] This is likely because of clobazam's higher affinity to the α<sub>2</sub> subunit of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, which mediates anxiolytic effects, than the α<sub>1</sub> subunit, which mediates sedative effect.[A256868] Additionally, clobazam is believed to be a partial agonist to the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor rather than non-selective full receptor agonists like 1,4-benzodiazepines, thus potentially explaining the decreased incidence of sedative effects.[A256968,A256973]    Clobazam has been marketed as an anxiolytic since 1975 and an anticonvulsant since 1984.[A521,A522] In October 21, 2011, the FDA approved clobazam as an adjunctive treatment for seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in adults and children aged two years and older.[A256958] In 2005, clobazam also received approval from Health Canada as an add-on therapy for generalized tonic-clonic, myoclonic, and focal impaired awareness seizures.[A256978]Clobazam belongs to the benzodiazepine class of drugs.[L44888] Clobazam acts on the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor to increase GABAnergic transmission, particularly chloride conductance in neurons.[A256868] This causes neuronal hyperpolarization, resulting in an increase in the action potential threshold and reducing neuron firing frequency.[A256908, A256913] Consequently, the general neuronal activity of the central nervous system is depressed; therefore, clobazam can be used to treat diseases caused by excessive excitatory action potentials.[A256913]    The effect of clobazam 20 mg and 80 mg administered twice daily on QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, evaluator-blinded, placebo-, and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) parallel thorough QT study in 280 healthy subjects. In a study with demonstrated ability to detect small effects, the upper bound of the one-sided 95% confidence interval for the largest placebo-adjusted, baseline-corrected QTc based on the Fridericia correction method was below 10 ms, the threshold for regulatory concern.  Thus, at a dose two times the maximum recommended dose, clobazam did not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent.[L44888]  The exact mechanism of action for clobazam, a 1,5-benzodiazepine, is not fully understood but is thought to involve the potentiation of GABAergic neurotransmission resulting from binding at the benzodiazepine site of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor.[L44888] Specifically, clobazam binds to the interface of the α<sub>2</sub> and γ<sub>2</sub>-subunit of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor.[A256868] It has a great affinity for the α<sub>2</sub> subunit than the α<sub>1</sub> subunit compared to other 1,4‐benzodiazepines.[A256938]Binding of clobazam to the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor causes chloride channels to open, resulting in an influx of chloride and thus hyperpolarization of neurons.[A256868]"
179,"For the treatment of severe hypertension and in the topical treatment (regrowth) of androgenic alopecia in males and females and stabilisation of hair loss in patients with androgenic alopecia.A potent direct-acting peripheral vasodilator (vasodilator agents) that reduces peripheral resistance and produces a fall in blood pressure.Minoxidil is an orally effective direct acting peripheral vasodilator that reduces elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure by decreasing peripheral vascular resistance. Minoxidil is also used topically to treat androgenetic alopecia. Microcirculatory blood flow in animals is enhanced or maintained in all systemic vascular beds. In man, forearm and renal vascular resistance decline; forearm blood flow increases while renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate are preserved. The predominant site of minoxidil action is arterial. Venodilation does not occur with minoxidil; thus, postural hypotension is unusual with its administration. The antihypertensive activity of minoxidil is due to its sulphate metabolite, minoxidil sulfate.Minoxidil is thought to promote the survival of human dermal papillary cells (DPCs) or hair cells by activating both extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt and by preventing cell death by increasing the ratio of BCl-2/Bax. Minoxidil may stimulate the growth of human hairs by prolonging anagen through these proliferative and anti-apoptotic effects on DPCs. Minoxidil, when used as a vasodilator, acts by opening adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channels in vascular smooth muscle cells. This vasodilation may also improve the viability of hair cells or hair follicles."
180,"For the treatment of anorexia, cachexia, or an unexplained, significant weight loss in patients with a diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Also used for the palliative management of recurrent, inoperable, or metastatic breast cancer, endometrial cancer, and prostate cancer in Canada and some other countries.17-Hydroxy-6-methylpregna-3,6-diene-3,20-dione. A progestational hormone used most commonly as the acetate ester. As the acetate, it is more potent than progesterone both as a progestagen and as an ovulation inhibitor. It has also been used in the palliative treatment of breast cancer.Megestrol is a synthetic progestin and has the same physiologic effects as natural progesterone. These effects include induction of secretory changes in the endometrium, increase in basal body temperature, pituitary inhibition, and production of withdrawal bleeding in the presence of estrogen. Mestrogel has slight glucocorticoid activity and very slight mineralocorticoid activity. This drug has no estrogenic, androgenic, or anabolic activity. The precise mechanism of megestrol&rsquo;s antianorexic and anticachetic effects is unknown. Initially developed as a contraceptive, it was first evaluated in breast cancer treatment in 1967.The precise mechanism by which megestrol acetate produces effects in anorexia and cachexia is unknown at the present time, but its progestin antitumour activity may involve suppression of luteinizing hormone by inhibition of pituitary function. Studies also suggest that the megestrol's weight gain effect is related to its appetite-stimulant or metabolic effects rather than its glucocorticoid-like effects or the production of edema. It has also been suggested that megestrol may alter metabolic pathyways via interferences with the production or action of mediators such as cachectin, a hormone that inhibits adipocyte lipogenic enzymes. "
181,"For remission induction and remission consolidation treatment of acute nonlymphocytic leukemias.An antineoplastic compound which also has antimetabolite action. The drug is used in the therapy of acute leukemia.Thioguanine is an antineoplastic anti-metabolite used in the treatment of several forms of leukemia including acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. Anti-metabolites masquerade as purine or pyrimidine - which become the building blocks of DNA. They prevent these substances becoming incorporated in to DNA during the ""S"" phase (of the cell cycle), stopping normal development and division. Thioguanine was first synthesized and entered into clinical trial more than 30 years ago. It is a 6-thiopurine analogue of the naturally occurring purine bases hypoxanthine and guanine. Intracellular activation results in incorporation into DNA as a false purine base. An additional cytotoxic effect is related to its incorporation into RNA. Thioguanine is cross-resistant with mercaptopurine. Cytotoxicity is cell cycle phase-specific (S-phase).Thioguanine competes with hypoxanthine and guanine for the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRTase) and is itself converted to 6-thioguanilyic acid (TGMP), which reaches high intracellular concentrations at therapeutic doses. TGMP interferes with the synthesis of guanine nucleotides by its inhibition of purine biosynthesis by pseudofeedback inhibition of glutamine-5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase, the first enzyme unique to the de novo pathway of purine ribonucleotide synthesis. TGMP also inhibits the conversion of inosinic acid (IMP) to xanthylic acid (XMP) by competition for the enzyme IMP dehydrogenase. Thioguanine nucleotides are incorporated into both the DNA and the RNA by phosphodiester linkages, and some studies have shown that incorporation of such false bases contributes to the cytotoxicity of thioguanine. Its tumor inhibitory properties may be due to one or more of its effects on feedback inhibition of de novo purine synthesis; inhibition of purine nucleotide interconversions; or incorporation into the DNA and RNA. The overall result of its action is a sequential blockade of the utilization and synthesis of the purine nucleotides."
182,"For the prevention and control of excessive bleeding following vaginal childbirthA homolog of ergonovine containing one more CH2 group. (Merck Index, 11th ed)Methylergometrine is a semisynthetic ergot alkaloid and a derivative of ergonovine and is used for the prevention and control of postpartum and post-abortion hemorrhage. In general, the effects of all the ergot alkaloids appear to results from their actions as partial agonists or antagonists at adrenergic, dopaminergic, and tryptaminergic receptors. The spectrum of effects depends on the agent, dosage, species, tissue, and experimental or physiological conditions. All of the alkaloids of ergot significantly increase the motor activity of the uterus. After small doses contractions are increased in force or frequency, or both, but are followed by a normal degree of relaxation. As the dose is increased, contractions become more forceful and prolonged, resting tonus is markedly increased, and sustained contracture can result.Methylergometrine acts directly on the smooth muscle of the uterus and increases the tone, rate, and amplitude of rhythmic contractions through binding and the resultant antagonism of the dopamine D1 receptor. Thus, it induces a rapid and sustained tetanic uterotonic effect which shortens the third stage of labor and reduces blood loss."
183,"For prevention and treatment of nausea, vomiting, and dizziness associated with motion sickness and vertigo (dizziness caused by other medical problems).Buclizine is an antihistamine medication with both antiemetic and anticholinergic effects [L6220], belonging to the _piperazine derivative_ family of drugs. It was manufactured by Stuart Pharms and initially approved by the FDA in 1957.[L6217] Following this, it was touted to be effective as an appetite stimulant in children when administered in the syrup form, however, this indication has not been validated.[A178102] In addition to the above conditions, buclizine has been studied in the treatment of migraine attacks and in the treatment of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. [A178105, A178108]Buclizine is a piperazine-derivative antihistamine used as an antivertigo/antiemetic agent. Buclizine is used in the prevention and treatment of nausea, vomiting, and dizziness associated with motion sickness. Additionally, it has been used in the management of vertigo in diseases affecting the vestibular apparatus. Although the mechanism by which buclizine exerts its antiemetic and antivertigo effects has not been fully elucidated, its central anticholinergic properties are partially responsible. The drug depresses labyrinth excitability and vestibular stimulation, and it may affect the medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone. It also possesses anticholinergic, antihistaminic, central nervous system depressant, and local anesthetic effects.Vomiting (emesis) is essentially a protective mechanism for removing irritant or otherwise harmful substances from the upper GI tract. Emesis or vomiting is controlled by the vomiting centre in the medulla region of the brain, an important part of which is the chemotrigger zone (CTZ). The vomiting centre possesses neurons which are rich in muscarinic cholinergic and histamine containing synapses. These types of neurons are especially involved in transmission from the vestibular apparatus to the vomiting centre. Motion sickness principally involves overstimulation of these pathways due to various sensory stimuli. Hence the action of buclizine which acts to block the histamine receptors in the vomiting centre and thus reduce activity along these pathways. Furthermore since buclizine possesses anti-cholinergic properties as well, the muscarinic receptors are similarly blocked."
184,"For the treatment of the following infections caused by susceptible gram-negative microorganisms: urinary tract infections, lower respiratory tract infections, septicemia, skin and skin-structure infections, intra-abdominal infections, and gynecologic infections.A monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic originally isolated from Chromobacterium violaceum. It is resistant to beta-lactamases and is used in gram-negative infections, especially of the meninges, bladder, and kidneys. It may cause a superinfection with gram-positive organisms.Aztreonam is a monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic (a monobactam) originally isolated from <i>Chromobacterium violaceum</i>. Aztreonam exhibits potent and specific activity in vitro against a wide spectrum of gram-negative aerobic pathogens including <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. It has no useful activity against gram-positive bacteria or anaerobes, but has very broad spectrum against gram-negative aerobes, including <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. This has given it the nickname ""the magic bullet for aerobic gram-negative bacteria"". Aztreonam, unlike the majority of beta-lactam antibiotics, does not induce beta-lactamase activity and its molecular structure confers a high degree of resistance to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases (such as penicillinases and cephalosporinases) produced by most gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens; it is, therefore, usually active against gram-negative aerobic microorganisms that are resistant to antibiotics hydrolyzed by beta-lactamases. It is active against many strains that are multiply-resistant to other antibiotics, such as certain cephalosporins, penicillin, and aminoglycosides. Aztreonam maintains its antimicrobial activity over a pH range of 6 to 8 in vitro, as well as in the presence of human serum and under anaerobic conditions.The bactericidal action of aztreonam results from the inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis due to a high affinity of aztreonam for penicillin binding protein 3 (PBP3). By binding to PBP3, aztreonam inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins. It is possible that aztreonam interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."
185,"For the relief of discomfort associated with acute painful musculoskeletal conditions.A centrally acting central muscle relaxant with sedative properties. It is claimed to inhibit muscle spasm by exerting an effect primarily at the level of the spinal cord and subcortical areas of the brain. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoea, 30th ed, p1202)Chlorzoxazone is a centrally-acting agent for painful musculoskeletal conditions. Data available from animal experiments as well as human study indicate that chlorzoxazone acts primarily at the level of the spinal cord and subcortical areas of the brain where it inhibits multisynaptic reflex a.c. involved in producing and maintaining skeletal muscle spasm of varied etiology. The clinical result is a reduction of the skeletal muscle spasm with relief of pain and increased mobility of the involved muscles.Chlorzoxazone inhibits degranulation of mast cells, subsequently preventing the release of histamine and slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A), mediators of type I allergic reactions. Chlorzoxazone also may reduce the release of inflammatory leukotrienes. Chlorzoxazone may act by inhibiting calcium and potassium influx which would lead to neuronal inhibition and muscle relaxation. Data available from animal experiments as well as human study indicate that chlorzoxazone acts primarily at the level of the spinal cord and subcortical areas of the brain where it inhibits multisynaptic reflex arcs involved in producing and maintaining skeletal muscle spasm"
186,"Mefloquine is indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate cases of malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax.  It is effective against chloroquine-resistant forms of Plasmodium falciparum.  Mefloquine is also indicated for the prophylaxis of malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, including chloroquine-resistant forms of Plasmodium falciparum.[L8953] Malaria is a protozoan disease that places an enormous burden on human health in endemic areas around the world. The 2020 World Health Organization malaria report indicates a 60% decrease in the global malaria fatality rate between 2000 to 2019.[L30618] Despite this, malaria remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality; 90% of deaths from malaria occur in Africa. Individuals at the highest risk for malaria are those in disease naïve populations, children under age 5, refugees in Central and Eastern Africa, nonimmune civilian and military travelers, pregnant women, and immigrants traveling to their place of origin.[L30623]    Mefloquine, commonly known as Lariam, is an antimalarial drug used for the prevention and treatment of malaria caused by infection with Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum. The drug was initially discovered by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) during a malaria drug discovery program between 1963 until 1976. It was approved by the FDA in 1989, and was first marketed by Hoffman Laroche.[A226838] This drug has been the subject of widespread controversy due to concerns regarding neurotoxic effects; product information warns of potential serious neuropsychiatric effects.[A226838,L8953]Sporozoites located in the salivary glands of mosquitoes infected with malaria parasites are introduced into the bloodstream of a human host during mosquito feeding. These sporozoites rapidly invade the liver, where they mature into liver-stage schizonts, rupturing and releasing 2,000 - 40,000 merozoites that invade red blood cells.[L30688] Mefloquine is an antimalarial drug acting as a blood schizonticide, preventing and treating malaria.[A226823,A226833]  The mechanism of action of mefloquine is not completely understood. Some studies suggest that mefloquine specifically targets the 80S ribosome of the Plasmodium falciparum, inhibiting protein synthesis and causing subsequent schizonticidal effects.[A172000] There are other studies in the literature with limited in vitro data on mefloquine's mechanism of action.[A226938,A15758]"
187,"Sulfadiazine is a sulfonamide antibiotic. The sulfonamides are synthetic bacteriostatic antibiotics with a wide spectrum against most gram-positive and many gram-negative organisms. However, many strains of an individual species may be resistant. Sulfonamides inhibit multiplication of bacteria by acting as competitive inhibitors of <i>p</i>-aminobenzoic acid in the folic acid metabolism cycle. Bacterial sensitivity is the same for the various sulfonamides, and resistance to one sulfonamide indicates resistance to all. Most sulfonamides are readily absorbed orally. However, parenteral administration is difficult, since the soluble sulfonamide salts are highly alkaline and irritating to the tissues. The sulfonamides are widely distributed throughout all tissues. High levels are achieved in pleural, peritoneal, synovial, and ocular fluids. Although these drugs are no longer used to treat meningitis, CSF levels are high in meningeal infections. Their antibacterial action is inhibited by pus.Sulfadiazine is a competitive inhibitor of the bacterial enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase. This enzyme is needed for the proper processing of para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) which is essential for folic acid synthesis. The inhibited reaction is necessary in these organisms for the synthesis of folic acid."
188,"Vinorelbine tartrate is indicated for adults in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as a single therapy or in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs [L1998].    Used in relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma, in combination with other chemotherapy agents [L2011].  For the treatment of recurrent or metastatic squamous cell head and neck cancer [L2011].    For the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer [L2011].    For the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, in patients previously treated with anthracyline and/or taxane therapy [L2011]. Vinorelbine is an anti-mitotic chemotherapy drug that is used in the treatment of several types of malignancies, including breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [L1998].  It was initially approved in the USA in 1990's for the treatment of NSCLC [L2010].    It is a third-generation vinca alkaloid. The introduction of third-generation drugs (vinorelbine, gemcitabine, taxanes) in platinum combination improved survival of patients with advanced NSCLC, with very similar results from the various drugs. Treatment toxicities are considerable in the combination treatment setting [A32347].    A study was done on the clearance rate of vinorelbine on individuals with various single polymorphonuclear mutations.  It was found that there was 4.3-fold variation in vinorelbine clearance across the cohort, suggesting a strong influence of genetics on the clearance of this drug [L2002].  Vinorelbine is a semi-synthetic vinca-alkaloid with a wide spectrum of anti-tumor activity. The vinca-alkaloids are considered spindle poisons. They work by interfering with the polymerization of tubulin, a protein responsible for building the microtubule system which appears during cell division in proliferating cancer cells [L2007].Vinca alkaloids are structurally similar compounds composed of two multi-ringed units, _vindoline_, and _catharanthine_. _Vinorelbine tartrate_ is a vinca alkaloid in which the catharanthine component is the target of structural modification [L2005], [L2006].    This structural modification contributes to unique pharmacologic properties.The antitumor activity of vinorelbine tartrate is believed to be owed to the inhibition of mitosis at metaphase via its interaction with tubulin [L1998].    Vinorelbine is a mitotic spindle poison that interferes with chromosomal segregation during mitosis, also known as cell division. It pauses cells at the _G2/M_ phases, when present at concentrations close to the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50). Microtubules, which are derived from polymers of tubulin, are the main target of vinorelbine.     The chemical modification used to produce vinorelbine allows for the opening of the eight-member catharanthine ring with the formation of both a covalent and reversible bond with tubulin [L2007].    The relative contribution of different microtubule-associated proteins in the production of tubulin vary between neural tissue and proliferating cells and this has important functional implications. The ability of vinorelbine to bind specifically to mitotic rather than other microtubules has been shown and may suggest that neurotoxicity is less likely to be a problem than with the molecular mechanism of action [L2007].     As with other anti-microtubule agents, vinorelbine is known to contribute apoptosis in malignant cells. The exact mechanisms by which this process occurs are complex and many details are yet to be elucidated. The disarray of the microtubule structure has a number of effects, including the induction of tumor suppressor gene _p53_ and activation/inactivation of a number of protein kinases involved in essential signaling pathways, including _p21 WAF1/CIP1_ and _Ras/Raf_, _PKC/PKA_. These molecular changes lead to phosphorylation and consequently inactivation of the apoptosis inhibitor _Bcl2_. This, in turn, results in a decrease in the formation of heterodimers between _Bcl2_ and the pro-apoptotic gene _BAX_, stimulating the sequence of cell apoptosis [L2007].    Vinorelbine tartrate also possibly interferes with amino acid, cyclic AMP and glutathione metabolism, calmodulin-dependent Ca++-transport ATPase activity, cellular respiration, and nucleic acid and lipid biosynthesis [L1998].  "
189,"Clozapine is indicated for the treatment of severely ill patients with schizophrenia who fail to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment. Because of the risks of severe neutropenia and of seizure associated with its use, Clozapine should be used only in patients who have failed to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment.[L905]    Clozapine is also indicated for reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are judged to be at chronic risk for re-experiencing suicidal behavior, based on history and recent clinical state. Suicidal behavior refers to actions by a patient that put him/herself at risk for death.[L905]Clozapine is a tricyclic dibenzodiazepine, classified as an atypical antipsychotic agent.[A256708] Clozapine displays affinity to various neuroreceptors with a particularly low affinity to the dopamine receptors, thus breaking the mold of first-generation antipsychotics and deeming it ""atypical"".[A256723]. This low affinity to dopamine receptors results in fewer extrapyramidal side effects, especially tardive dyskinesia.[A185747] However, its promiscuity toward the muscarinic and adrenergic receptors can result in other side effects, notably gastrointestinal hypomotility and orthostatic hypotension. [L905,A215552]. Despite its effectiveness in treating both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, clozapine was briefly removed from the market in various jurisdictions in 1970 due to severe agranulocytosis.[A256713,A256718] However, continued evidence of its effectiveness led to clozapine's eventual reintroduction, although with a reluctance to prescribe it.[A256718]     Clozapine was approved by the FDA in 1989 for treatment-resistant schizophrenia under the brand CLOZARIL.[L905] Due to its severe adverse effects profile, clozapine is only available through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Clozapine REMS Program.[L905]Clozapine is a psychotropic agent belonging to the chemical class of benzisoxazole derivatives that is universally regarded as the treatment of choice for treatment-resistant schizophrenia.[A256568] Although it is thought to mediate its pharmacological effect through antagonism of the dopamine type 2 (D<sub>2) and the serotonin type 2A (5-HT2A>) receptors, research have shown that clozapine can act on various types of receptors.[A185747]    Patients should be counseled regarding the risk of hypersensitivity reactions such as agranulocytosis and myocarditis with clozapine use.[L905] Clozapine-induced agranulocytosis, which is a reduction in the absolute neutrophil count or white blood cell count, places the patient at an increased risk for infection.[A215552,L905] Agranulocytosis is most likely to occur in the first 3-6 months of therapy, but it can still occur after years of treatment. The mechanism is thought to be a dose-independent and immune-mediated reaction against neutrophils.[A215557]  Patients are strictly monitored by lab testing (complete blood count with differential) to ensure agranulocytosis is detected and treated if it occurs.[L905] Testing is initially completed at one-week intervals but is expanded to two-week intervals at six months, and then four-week intervals at twelve months if lab results have been within an appropriate range. Monitoring parameters may change if there is any break in therapy. In Canada, the patient's lab values are reported to the manufacturer for hematological monitoring, and in the USA, the patient's lab values are reported to the REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program.[A215562] These programs function to notify the care provider of any significant drop in WBC/neutrophil count, or if there is a drop below a threshold level. Patients who enter the ""Red"" zone (WBC<2x109/L or ANC<1.5x109/L) should normally not be re-challenged.[L905]      Clozapine-induced myocarditis is a hypersensitivity reaction that usually occurs in the third week of clozapine therapy and about 2% of clozapine patients.[A215547] Monitor the patient's troponin, CRP, and ECG at baseline, and 28 days into treatment. Follow guidelines for appropriate next steps according to the patient's lab results. If myocarditis occurs, the patient should not be re-challenged with clozapine.[L905] The mechanism of action of clozapine is unknown. However, it has been proposed that the therapeutic efficacy of clozapine in schizophrenia is mediated through antagonism of the dopamine type 2 (D2) and the serotonin type 2A (5-HT2A</sub>) receptors. Clozapine also acts as an antagonist at adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic, and other dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors.[L905]     Clozapine demonstrated binding affinity to the following receptors: histamine H1 (Ki 1.1 nM), adrenergic α1A (Ki 1.6 nM), serotonin 5-HT6 (Ki 4 nM), serotonin 5-HT2A (Ki 5.4 nM), muscarinic M1 (Ki 6.2 nM), serotonin 5-HT7 (Ki 6.3 nM), serotonin 5-HT2C (Ki 9.4 nM), dopamine D4 (Ki 24 nM), adrenergic α2A (Ki 90 nM), serotonin 5-HT3 (Ki 95 nM), serotonin 5-HT1A (Ki 120 nM), dopamine D2 (Ki 160 nM), dopamine D1 (Ki 270 nM), dopamine D5 (Ki 454 nM), and dopamine D3 (Ki 555 nM).[L905]     Clozapine acts as an antagonist at other receptors, but with lower potency. Antagonism at receptors other than dopamine and 5HT2 with similar receptor affinities may explain some of the other therapeutic and side effects of clozapine. Clozapine's antagonism of muscarinic M1-5 receptors may explain its anticholinergic effects.[A256553] Clozapine's antagonism of histamine H1 receptors may explain the somnolence observed with this drug.[A256558] Clozapine's antagonism of adrenergic α1 receptors may explain the orthostatic hypotension observed with this drug.[A256563]"
190,"Used alone as a short-term sleep aid, in combination with other drugs as a night-time cold and allergy relief drug. Histamine H1 antagonist with pronounced sedative properties. It is used in allergies and as an antitussive, antiemetic, and hypnotic. Doxylamine has also been administered in veterinary applications and was formerly used in parkinsonism.Doxylamine is an antihistamine commonly used as a sleep aid. This drug is also used to relieve symptoms of hay fever (allergic rhinitis), hives (rash or itching), and other allergic reactions. Doxylamine is a member of the ethanolamine class of antihistamines and has anti-allergy power far superior to virtually every other antihistamine on the market, with the exception of diphenhydramine (Benadryl). It is also the most powerful over-the-counter sedative available in the United States, and more sedating than many prescription hypnotics. In a study, it was found to be superior to even the barbiturate, phenobarbital for use as a sedative. Doxylamine is also a potent anticholinergic.Like other antihistamines, doxylamine acts by competitively inhibiting histamine at H1&nbsp;receptors. It also has substantial sedative and anticholinergic effects."
191,"**Emergency contraception**    Levonorgestrel, in the single-agent emergency contraceptive form, is indicated for the prevention of pregnancy after the confirmed or suspected failure of contraception methods or following unprotected intercourse. It is distributed by prescription for patients under 17, and over the counter for those above this age.[L7760] This levonorgestrel-only form of contraception is not indicated for regular contraception and must be taken as soon as possible within 72 hours after intercourse.[A181976,L7760] It has shown a lower efficacy when it is used off label within 96 hours.[T659]    **Long-term contraception or nonemergency contraception**    In addition to the above indication in emergency contraception, levonorgestrel is combined with other contraceptives in contraceptive formulations designed for regular use, for example with ethinyl estradiol.[L7766] It is used in various hormone-releasing intrauterine devices for long-term contraception ranging for a duration of 3-5 years.[L7778,L7781,L7787] Product labeling for Mirena specifically mentions that it is recommended in women who have had at least 1 child and can be indicated for the prevention of pregnancy for up to 8 years.[L7778,L42950] A subdermal implant is also available for the prevention of pregnancy for up to 5 years.[L7823]    **Hormone therapy and off-label uses**    Levonorgestrel is prescribed in combination with estradiol as hormone therapy during menopause to manage vasomotor symptoms and to prevent osteoporosis.[L7805]Off-label, levonorgestrel may be used to treat menorrhagia, endometrial hyperplasia, and endometriosis.[T659]Levonorgestrel (LNG) is a synthetic progestogen similar to [Progesterone] used in contraception and hormone therapy.[A181988,T659] Also known as Plan B, it is used as a single agent in emergency contraception, and as a hormonal contraceptive released from an intrauterine device, commonly referred to as an IUD. Some of these devices are known as Jaydess, Kyleena, and Mirena.  A subdermal implant of levonorgestrel that slowly releases the hormone over a long-term period is also available.[L7823]  In addition to the above uses, levonorgestrel is used as a component of long-term combination contraceptives.[A181991,L7760,L7778]     Globally, levonorgestrel is the most commonly used emergency contraceptive. It was initially granted FDA approval in 1982 and was the first emergency contraceptive containing only progesterone, showing high levels of efficacy and a lack of estrogenic adverse effects when compared to older emergency contraceptive regimens.[A181976,A181994,L7760]Levonorgestrel prevents pregnancy by interfering with ovulation, fertilization, and implantation. The levonorgestrel-only containing emergency contraceptive tablet is 89% effective if it is used according to prescribing information within 72 hours after intercourse.[A181976,A181988] The intrauterine and implantable devices releasing levonorgestrel are more than 99% in preventing pregnancy.[A182123,L7778,L7781] Levonorgestrel utilized as a component of hormonal therapy helps to prevent endometrial carcinoma associated with unopposed estrogen administration.[A182042]**Mechanism of action on ovulation**    Oral contraceptives containing levonorgestrel suppress gonadotropins, inhibiting ovulation. Specifically, levonorgestrel binds to progesterone and androgen receptors and slows the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. This process results in the suppression of the normal physiological luteinizing hormone (LH) surge that precedes ovulation. It inhibits the rupture of follicles and viable egg release from the ovaries. Levonorgestrel has been proven to be more effective when administered before ovulation.[T659]    **Mechanism of action in cervical mucus changes**    Similar to other levonorgestrel-containing contraceptives, the intrauterine (IUD) forms of levonorgestrel likely prevent pregnancy by increasing the thickness of cervical mucus, interfering with the movement and survival of sperm, and inducing changes in the endometrium, where a fertilized ovum is usually implanted.[L7778,L7781] Levonorgestrel is reported to alter the consistency of mucus in the cervix, which interferes with sperm migration into the uterus for fertilization. Levonorgestrel is not effective after implantation has occurred.[A181976]   Interestingly, recent evidence has refuted the commonly believed notion that levonorgestrel changes the consistency of cervical mucus when it is taken over a short-term period, as in emergency contraception. Over a long-term period, however, levonorgestrel has been proven to thicken cervical mucus.[A181976] The exact mechanism of action of levonorgestrel is not completely understood and remains a topic of controversy and ongoing investigation.[A181976,L7760]    *Effects on implantation**    The effects of levonorgestrel on endometrial receptivity are unclear, and the relevance of this mechanism to the therapeutic efficacy of levonorgestrel is contentious.[A175372,A218666] Prescribing information for levonorgestrel IUDs state that they exert local morphological changes to the endometrium (e.g. stromal pseudodecidualization, glandular atrophy) that may play a role in their contraceptive activity.[L7778,L7781]    **Mechanism of action in hormone therapy**    When combined with estrogens for the treatment of menopausal symptoms and prevention of osteoporosis, levonorgestrel serves to lower the carcinogenic risk of unopposed estrogen therapy via the inhibition of endometrial proliferation. Unregulated endometrial proliferation sometimes leads to endometrial cancer after estrogen use.[L7808]"
192,Mainly used to treat patients in vasodilatory shock states such as septic shock and neurogenic shock and has shown a survival benefit over dopamine. Also used as a vasopressor medication for patients with critical hypotension.Precursor of epinephrine that is secreted by the adrenal medulla and is a widespread central and autonomic neurotransmitter. Norepinephrine is the principal transmitter of most postganglionic sympathetic fibers and of the diffuse projection system in the brain arising from the locus ceruleus. It is also found in plants and is used pharmacologically as a sympathomimetic.Noradrenaline acts on both alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors to cause vasoconstriction. Its effect in-vitro is often limited to the increasing of blood pressure through antagonising alpha-1 and alpha-2 receptors and causing a resultant increase in systemic vascular resistance.Norepinephrine functions as a peripheral vasoconstrictor by acting on alpha-adrenergic receptors. It is also an inotropic stimulator of the heart and dilator of coronary arteries as a result of it's activity at the beta-adrenergic receptors.
193,"This drug is indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder and its associated symptoms.[FDA label]    Mirtazapine has been used off-label for a variety of conditions including panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, dysthymia, tension headaches, hot flushes, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), sleep disorders, substance abuse disorders, and sexual disorders, among others.[A177811,A177946]Mirtazapine is a tetracyclic _piperazino-azepine_ antidepressant agent that was initially approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in the Netherlands in 1994.[A177946] This drug was first manufactured by Organon Inc., and received FDA approval in 1997 for the treatment of major depressive disorder.[T595, L6157] The effects of this drug may be observed as early as 1 week after beginning therapy.[A178144,L6160]    In addition to its beneficial effects in depression, mirtazapine has been reported to be efficacious in the off-label management of various other conditions.  It may improve the symptoms of neurological disorders, reverse weight loss caused by medical conditions, improve sleep, and prevent nausea and vomiting after surgery.[A177811]**General effects and a note on suicidality**    Mirtazapine is effective in treating moderate to severe depression and treats many symptoms normally associated with this condition. These symptoms may include disturbed sleep, lack of appetite, and anhedonia, in addition to anxiety.[A555,A178150,T595]. It is important to note that suicidal ideation and behavior may emerge or increase during treatment with mirtazapine, as with any other antidepressant. This risk is especially pronounced in younger individuals. Patients, medical professionals, and families should monitor for suicidal thoughts, worsening depression, anxiety, agitation, sleep changes, irritable behavior, aggression, impulsivity, restlessness, and other unusual behavior when this drug is taken or the dose is adjusted.[FDA label] Do not administer mirtazapine to children. When deciding to prescribe this drug, carefully consider the increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior, especially in young adults.[FDA label]    **Effects on appetite and weight gain**    In addition to the above effects, mirtazapine exerts stimulating effects on appetite, and has been used for increasing appetite and decreasing nausea in cancer patients.[A177952, A177958]  Some studies and case reports have shown that this drug improves eating habits and weight gain in patients suffering from anorexia nervosa when administered in conjunction with psychotherapy and/or other psychotropic drugs.[A177961,A178186] In a clinical trial, women with depression experienced a clinically significant mean increase in body weight, fat mass, and concentrations of leptin when treated with mirtazapine for a 6-week period, with a lack of effect on glucose homeostasis.[A177970]    **Effects on sleep**    The use of mirtazapine to treat disordered sleep has been leveraged from its tendency to cause somnolence, which is a frequently experienced adverse effect by patients taking this drug.[A177808,A177994,FDA label] Mirtazapine has been shown to exert beneficial effects on sleep latency, duration, and quality due to its sedating properties.[A177967] Insomnia is a common occurrence in patients with depression, and mirtazapine has been found to be efficacious in treating this condition.[A177808]**Summary**    The mechanism of action of mirtazapine is not fully understood[FDA label] but may be explained by its effects on central adrenergic and serotonergic activity. This drug exhibits a fast onset of action, a high level of response, a manageable side-effect profile, and dual noradrenergic and serotonergic effects that are unique from the effects of other antidepressants.[A177811]    **Effects on various receptors**    It has been shown that both noradrenergic and serotonergic activity increase following mirtazapine administration. The results of these studies demonstrate mirtazapine exerts antagonist activity at presynaptic α2-adrenergic inhibitory autoreceptors and heteroreceptors in the central nervous system. This is thought to lead to enhanced noradrenergic and serotonergic activity [FDA label], which are known to improve the symptoms of depression and form the basis of antidepressant therapy.[A178198, A178201]    Mirtazapine is a strong antagonist of serotonin 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors. It has not been found to bind significantly to the serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors [FDA label] but indirectly increases 5-HT1A transmission.[A4709]      In addition to the above effects, mirtazapine is a peripheral α1-adrenergic antagonist. This action may explain episodes of orthostatic hypotension that have been reported after mirtazapine use.[FDA label] Mirtazapine is a potent histamine (H1) receptor antagonist, which may contribute to its powerful sedating effects.[FDA label] The pain-relieving effects of mirtazapine may be explained by its effects on opioid receptors.[A13073,A177868]"
194,"For the management of anxiety disorders or for the short-term relief of the symptoms of anxiety.A carbamate with hypnotic, sedative, and some muscle relaxant properties, although in therapeutic doses reduction of anxiety rather than a direct effect may be responsible for muscle relaxation. Meprobamate has been reported to have anticonvulsant actions against petit mal seizures, but not against grand mal seizures (which may be exacerbated). It is used in the treatment of anxiety disorders, and also for the short-term management of insomnia but has largely been superseded by the benzodiazepines. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p603) Meprobamate is a controlled substance in the U.S.Meprobamate is an anxiolytic drug. It was the best selling minor tranquilizer for a time but has largely been replaced by benzodiazepines. Meprobamate has most of the pharmacological effects and dangers of the barbiturates (though it was marketed as being safer) but it is less sedating at effective doses. Meprobamate exhibits some anticonvulsant effects in absence seizures; however, it is reported to potentially exacerbate generalized tonic-clonic seizures. It has also been used as a hypnotic (sleeping pill). However, its is currently only licensed as an anxiolytic and it is a third or fourth-order choice.Meprobamate's mechanism of action is not fully understood; in animal studies, meprobamate is reported to act at multiple sites in the central nervous system, such as the thalamus and limbic system. It binds to the GABAA receptors, leading to inhibitory effects on the neurons transmitting signals in the reticular formation and spinal cord. Consequently, effects such as sedation and altered perception of pain are observed. "
195,"For the treatment or relief of nausea and vomiting.A dopamine antagonist that is particularly useful in treating the nausea and vomiting associated with anesthesia, mildly emetic cancer chemotherapy agents, radiation therapy, and toxins. This piperazine phenothiazine does not prevent vertigo or motion sickness. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1994, p457)Thiethylperazine, an atypical antipsychotic agent, is used to treat both negative and positive symptoms of schizophrenia, acute mania with bipolar disorder, agitation, and psychotic symptoms in dementia. Future uses may include the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder and severe behavioral disorders in autism. Structurally and pharmacologically similar to clozapine, Thiethylperazine binds to alpha(1), dopamine, histamine H1, muscarinic, and serotonin type 2 (5-HT2) receptors.Thiethylperazine is an antagonist at types 1, 2, and 4 dopamine receptors, 5-HT receptor types 2A and 2C, muscarinic receptors 1 through 5, alpha(1)-receptors, and histamine H1-receptors. Thiethylperazine's antipsychotic effect is due to antagonism at dopamine and serotonin type 2 receptors, with greater activity at serotonin 5-HT2 receptors than at dopamine type-2 receptors. This may explain the lack of extrapyramidal effects. Thiethylperazine does not appear to block dopamine within the tubero-infundibular tract, explaining the lower incidence of hyperprolactinemia than with typical antipsychotic agents or risperidone. Antagonism at muscarinic receptors, H1-receptors, and alpha(1)-receptors also occurs with thiethylperazine."
196,"Tihexyphenidyl is indicated as an adjunct in the treatment of parkinsonism, an adjuvant in the treatment of parkinsonism with levodopa, and in the control of extrapyramidal disorders caused by central nervous system drugs.[L31773,L31778]Trihexyphenidyl is a centrally acting muscarinic antagonist used for treatment of parkinsonism and drug-induced extrapyramidal disorders.[L31773,L31778] Its discovery was published in 1949 in a study looking for drugs with antispasmodic activity.[A229103] Trihexyphenidyl is rarely used in the treatment of parkinsonism, and is not a first line treatment due to significant adverse effects.[L31843] It has largely been replaced by drugs such as [levodopa].[L31843]    Trihexyphenidyl was granted FDA approval on 13 May 1949.[L31768]Trihexyphenidyl is an antimuscarinic indicated as an adjunct in the treatment of parkinsonism or as a treatment for drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms.[L31773,L31778] It has a long duration of action as it does not need to be given every day.[L31793] It has a wide therapeutic window, with acute toxicity being non fatal in doses as high as 300 mg.[L31793] Patients should have their iridocorneal angle examined before and intraocular pressure monitored during therapy.[L31793] Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of anhidrosis and hyperthermia.[L31793]Trihexyphenidyl is a non-selective muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist but binds with higher affinity to the M1 subtype.[A4716] In vivo studies have shown that trihexyphenidyl demonstrates higher affinity for central muscarinic receptors located in the cerebral cortex and lower affinity for those located peripherally.[A4716,A222363] Other studies suggest that trihexyphenidyl may modify nicotinic acetylcholine receptor neurotransmission, leading indirectly to enhanced dopamine release in the striatum.[A222373] Although the anticholinergic has proven to be useful in the treatment of symptoms associated with Parkinson’s disease or other movement disorders, its mechanism of action has yet to be fully elucidated.[A222368,A222358]"
197,"For the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, as well as prevention of acute nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy. Also used for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting for up to 24 hours post operation.Palonosetron (INN, trade name Aloxi) is an antagonist of 5-HT3 receptors that is indicated for the prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). It is the most effective of the 5-HT3 antagonists in controlling delayed CINV nausea and vomiting that appear more than 24 hours after the first dose of a course of chemotherapy and is the only drug of its class approved for this use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. As of 2008, it is the most recent 5-HT3 antagonist to enter clinical use.Palonosetron is an antinauseant and antiemetic agent indicated for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with moderately-emetogenic cancer chemotherapy and for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Palonosetron is a highly specific and selective serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist that is pharmacologically related to other 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, but differs structurally. Palonosetron has a high affinity for 5-HT3receptors, but has little to no affinity for other receptors. The serontonin 5-HT3receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery, and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. It is suggested that chemotherapeutic agents release serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine by causing degenerative changes in the GI tract. The serotonin then stimulates the vagal and splanchnic nerve receptors that project to the medullary vomiting center, as well as the 5-HT3 receptors in the area postrema, thus initiating the vomiting reflex, causing nausea and vomiting.Palonosetron is a selective serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. The antiemetic activity of the drug is brought about through the inhibition of 5-HT3 receptors present both centrally (medullary chemoreceptor zone) and peripherally (GI tract). This inhibition of 5-HT3receptors in turn inhibits the visceral afferent stimulation of the vomiting center, likely indirectly at the level of the area postrema, as well as through direct inhibition of serotonin activity within the area postrema and the chemoreceptor trigger zone. Alternative mechanisms appear to be primarily responsible for delayed nausea and vomiting induced by emetogenic chemotherapy, since similar temporal relationships between between serotonin and emesis beyond the first day after a dose have not been established, and 5-HT3 receptor antagonists generally have not appeared to be effective alone in preventing or ameliorating delayed effects. It has been hypothesized that palonosetron's potency and long plasma half-life may contribute to its observed efficacy in preventing delayed nausea and vomiting caused by moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy."
198,"Used to treat irregular duration of cycles and irregular occurrence and duration of periods caused by progesterone deficiency. Also used to prevent natural abortion in patients who have a history of habitual abortions.A synthetic progestational hormone with no androgenic or estrogenic properties. Unlike many other progestational compounds, dydrogesterone produces no increase in temperature and does not inhibit ovulation.Dydrogesterone is an orally active progestogen which acts directly on the uterus, producing a complete secretory endometrium in an estrogen-primed uterus. At therapeutic levels, dydrogesterone has no contraceptive effect as it does not inhibit or interfere with ovulation or the corpus luteum. Furthermore, dydrogesterone is non-androgenic, non-estrogenic, non-corticoid, non-anabolic and is not excreted as pregnanediol. Dydrogesterone helps to regulate the healthy growth and normal shedding of the uterus lining. Therefore, it may be useful in the treatment of menstrual disorders such as absent, irregular or painful menstrual periods, infertility, premenstrual syndrome and endometriosis.Dydrogesterone is a progestogen that works by regulating the healthy growth and normal shedding of the womb lining by acting on progesterone receptors in the uterus."
199,"For reducing the incidence and severity of cardiomyopathy associated with doxorubicin administration in women with metastatic breast cancer who have received a cumulative doxorubicin hydrochloride dose of 300 mg/m^2 and would benefit from continued doxorubicin therapy. Also approved for the treatment of extravasation from intravenous anthracyclines.An antimitotic agent with immunosuppressive properties. Dexrazoxane, the (+)-enantiomorph of razoxane, provides cardioprotection against anthracycline toxicity. It appears to inhibit formation of a toxic iron-anthracycline complex. [PubChem]  The Food and Drug Administration has designated dexrazoxane as an orphan drug for use in the prevention or reduction in the incidence and severity of anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy.Dexrazoxane is a cardioprotective agent for use in conjunction with doxorubicin indicated for reducing the incidence and severity of cardiomyopathy associated with doxorubicin administration in women with metastatic breast cancer who have received a cumulative doxorubicin dose. Patients receiving anthracycline-derivative antineoplastic agents may experience three types of cardiotoxicity: acute transient type; chronic, subacute type (related to cumulative dose and has a more indolent onset later on); and a late-onset type that manifests years after therapy, mainly in patients that have been exposed to the drug as a child. Although the exact mechanism of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is not known, it has shown to exert a variety of actions that may result in the development of cardiotoxicity. In animals, anthracyclines cause a selective inhibition of cardiac muscle gene expression for α-actin, troponin, myosin light-chain 2, and the M isoform of creatine kinase. This may lead to myofibrillar loss associated with anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. Anthracyclines may also cause myocyte damage via calcium overload, altered myocardial adrenergic function, release of vasoactive amines, and proinflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the main cause of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is associated with free-radical damage to DNA. The drugs intercalate DNA, chelate metal ions to produce drug-metal complexes, and generate superoxide radicals via oxidation-reduction reactions. Anthracyclines also contain a quinone structure that can undergo reduction via NADPH-dependent reactions to produce a semiquinone free radical that initiates a cascade of superoxide and hydroxide radical generation. Chelation of metal ions, particularly iron, by anthracyclines results in an anthracycline-metal complex that catalyzes the generation of reactive oxygen free radicals. This complex is a powerful oxidant that can initiate lipid peroxidation in the absence of oxygen free radicals. The toxicity induced by antrhacyclines may be exacerbated in cardiac cells, as these cells do not possess sufficient amounts of certain enzymes (e.g., superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase) involved in detoxifying free radicals and protecting the cells from subsequent damage.The mechanism by which dexrazoxane exerts its cardioprotective activity is not fully understood. Dexrazoxane is a cyclic derivative of EDTA that readily penetrates cell membranes. Results of laboratory studies suggest that dexrazoxane (a prodrug) is converted intracellularly to a ring-opened bidentate chelating agent that chelates to free iron and interferes with iron-mediated free radical generation thought to be responsible, in part, for anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy. It should be noted that dexrazoxane may also be protective through its inhibitory effect on topoisomerase II."
200," Due to their selectivity for the peripheral blood vessels, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are associated with a lower incidence of myocardial depression and cardiac conduction abnormalities than other calcium channel blockers [A175327].    Amlodipine is commonly used in the treatment of high blood pressure and angina. Amlodipine has antioxidant properties and an ability to enhance the production of nitric oxide (NO), an important vasodilator that decreases blood pressure [A175321].  The option for single daily dosing of amlodipine is an attractive feature of this drug [FDA label].**General pharmacodynamic effects**    Amlodipine has a strong affinity for cell membranes, modulating calcium influx by inhibiting selected membrane calcium channels. This drug's unique binding properties allow for its long-acting action and less frequent dosing regimen [A573], [FDA label].      **Hemodynamic effects**    After the administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine to patients diagnosed with hypertension, amlodipine causes vasodilation, which results in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressure. During these blood pressure reductions, there are no clinically significant changes in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with long-term use. Acute intravenous administration of amlodipine reduces arterial blood pressure and increases heart rate in patients with chronic stable angina, however, chronic oral administration of amlodipine in clinical studies did not cause clinically significant alterations in heart rate or blood pressures in patients diagnosed with angina and normal blood pressure. With long-term, once daily oral administration, antihypertensive effectiveness is maintained for at least 24 hours [FDA label].     **Electrophysiologic effects**    Amlodipine does not change sinoatrial (SA) nodal function or atrioventricular (AV) conduction in animals or humans. In patients who were diagnosed with chronic stable angina, the intravenous administration of 10 mg of amlodipine did not cause clinically significant alterations A-H and H-V conduction and sinus node recovery time after cardiac pacing. Patients administered amlodipine with concomitant beta-blockers produced similar results. In clinical trials in which amlodipine was given in combination with beta-blockers to patients diagnosed with hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic parameters were noted. In clinical studies comprised of angina patients alone, amlodipine did not change electrocardiographic intervals or produce high degrees of AV block [FDA label].     **Effects on angina**    Amlodipine relieves the symptoms of chest pain associated with angina. In patients diagnosed with angina, daily administration of a single amlodipine dose increases total exercise time, the time to angina onset, and the time to 1 mm ST-segment depression on ECG studies, decreases anginal attack frequency, and decreases the requirement for nitroglycerin tablets [F3757]. **Mechanism of action on blood pressure**    Amlodipine is considered a peripheral arterial vasodilator that exerts its action directly on vascular smooth muscle to lead to a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance, causing a decrease in blood pressure. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (calcium ion antagonist or slow-channel blocker) that inhibits the influx of calcium ions into both vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Experimental studies imply that amlodipine binds to both _dihydropyridine_ and _nondihydropyridine_ binding sites, located on cell membranes. The contraction of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent on the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells by specific ion channels. Amlodipine blocks calcium ion influx across cell membranes with selectivity. A stronger effect of amlodipine is exerted on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells [FDA label]. Direct actions of amlodipine on vascular smooth muscle result in reduced blood pressure [F3757].     **Mechanism of action in angina**    The exact mechanism by which amlodipine relieves the symptoms of angina have not been fully elucidated to this date, however, the mechanism of action is likely twofold:    Amlodipine has a dilating effect on peripheral arterioles, reducing the total peripheral resistance (afterload) against which the cardiac muscle functions. Since the heart rate remains stable during amlodipine administration, the reduced work of the heart reduces both myocardial energy use and oxygen requirements [F3757].    Dilatation of the main coronary arteries and coronary arterioles, both in healthy and ischemic areas, is another possible mechanism of amlodipine reduction of blood pressure. The dilatation causes an increase in myocardial oxygen delivery in patients experiencing coronary artery spasm (Prinzmetal's or variant angina) and reduces coronary vasoconstriction caused by smoking [F3757]."
201,"For the palliative treatment of mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer's type.A centerally active cholinesterase inhibitor that has been used to counter the effects of muscle relaxants, as a respiratory stimulant, and in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other central nervous system disorders. Tacrine has been discontinued for the United States market.Tacrine is a parasympathomimetic- a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor that is indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer's type. An early pathophysiological feature of Alzheimer's disease that is associated with memory loss and cognitive deficits is a deficiency of acetylcholine as a result of selective loss of cholinergic neurons in the cerebral cortex, nucleus basalis, and hippocampus. Tacrine is postulated to exert its therapeutic effect by enhancing cholinergic function. This is accomplished by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses through reversible inhibition of its hydrolysis by acetylcholinesterase. If this proposed mechanism of action is correct, tacrine's effect may lessen as the disease progresses and fewer cholinergic neurons remain functionally intact. There is no evidence that tacrine alters the course of the underlying dementing process.The mechanism of tacrine is not fully known, but it is suggested that the drug is an anticholinesterase agent which reversibly binds with and inactivates cholinesterases. This inhibits the hydrolysis of acetylcholine released from functioning cholinergic neurons, thus leading to an accumulation of acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses. The result is a prolonged effect of acetylcholine."
202,"For the treatment of peptic ulcer disease and the relief of smooth muscle spasms in gastrointestinal disorders.Oxyphencyclimine is an anticholinergic drug (trade name Daricon) used in treating peptic ulcers.Oxyphencyclimine is a synthetic anticholinergic agent which has been shown in experimental and clinical studies to have a pronounced antispasmodic and antisecretory effect on the gastrointestinal tract. Oxyphencyclimine is an antimuscarinic, anticholinergic drug.Oxyphencyclimine binds the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. It may block all three types of muscarinic receptors including M-1 receptors in the CNS and ganglia, M-2 receptors in the heart (vagus) and M-3 receptors at the parasympathetic NEJ system. The muscarinic acetylcholine receptors mediate various cellular responses, including inhibition of adenylate cyclase, breakdown of phosphoinositides and modulation of potassium channels through the action of G proteins. Oxphencyclimine inhibits vagally mediated reflexes by antagonizing the action of acetylcholine. This in turn reduces the secretion of gastric acids in the stomach."
203,"Triamterene is indicated for the treatment of edema associated with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver, and the nephrotic syndrome; also in steroid-induced edema, idiopathic edema, and edema due to secondary hyperaldosteronism.[L6166]    Triamterene in combination with hydrochlorothiazide is indicated for the managment of hypertension or treatment of edema in patients who develop hypokalemia following hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy, and in patients who require thiazide diuretic and in whom the development of hypokalemia cannot be risked.[L6169] Triamterene allows the maintenance of potassium balance when given in combination with loop diuretics and thiazides.[T28]Triamterene (2,4,7-triamino-6-phenylpteridine) is a potassium-sparing diuretic that is used in the management of hypertension. It works by promoting the excretion of sodium ions and water while decreasing the potassium excretion in the distal part of the nephron in the kidneys by working on the lumenal side.[A177985] Since it acts on the distal nephron where only a small fraction of sodium ion reabsorption occurs, triamterene is reported to have limited diuretic efficacy.[T28] Due to its effects on increased serum potassium levels, triamterene is associated with a risk of producing hyperkalemia. Triamterene is a weak antagonist of folic acid, and a photosensitizing drug.[L6163]     Triamterene was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the U.S. in 1964.[L6163] Currently, triamterene is used in the treatment of edema associated with various conditions as monotherapy and is approved for use with other diuretics to enhance diuretic and potassium-sparing effects.[L6166] It is also found in a combination product with hydrochlorothiazide that is used for the management of hypertension or treatment of edema in patients who develop hypokalemia on hydrochlorothiazide alone.Triamterene, a relatively weak, potassium-sparing diuretic and antihypertensive, is used in the management of hypertension and edema. It primarily works on the distal nephron in the kidneys; it acts from the late distal tubule to the collecting duct to inhibit Na+ reabsorption and decreasing K+ excretion.[T28] As triamterene tends to conserve potassium more strongly than promoting Na+ excretion, it can cause an increase in serum potassium, which may result in hyperkalemia potentially associated with cardiac irregularities.[L6166] In healthy volunteers administered with oral triamterene, there was an increase in the renal clearnace of sodium and magnesium, and a decrease in the clearance of uric acid and creatinine[A178039] due to its effect of reducing glomerular filtration renal plasma flow.[L6169] Triamterene does not affect calcium excretion.[L6169] In clinical trials, the use of triamterene in combination with hydrochlorothiazide resulted an enhanced blood pressure-lowering effects of hydrochlorothiazide.[A178048] Triamterene inhibits the epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) located on the lumenal side in the late distal convoluted tubule and collecting tubule [A178042], which are transmembrane channels that normally promote sodium uptake and potassium secretion.[A178048] In the late distal tubule to the collecting duct, sodium ions are actively reabsorbed via ENaC on the luminal membrane and are extruded out of the cell into the peritubular medium by a sodium-potassium exchange pump, the Na-K-ATPase,[A178054] with water following passively.[T28] Triamterene exerts a diuretic effect on the distal renal tubule to inhibit the reabsorption of sodium ions in exchange for potassium and hydrogen ions and its natriuretic activity is limited by the amount of sodium reaching its site of action.[L6169] Its action is antagonistic to that of adrenal mineralocorticoids, such as aldosterone, but it is not an inhibitor or antagonist of aldosterone.[L6166] Triamterene maintains or increases sodium excretion, thereby increasing the excretion of water, and reducing the excess loss of potassium, hydrogen, and chloride ions by inhibiting the distal tubular exchange mechanism.[L6169] Due to its diuretic effect, triamterene rapidly and reversibly reduces the lumen-negative transepithelial potential difference by almost completely abolishing Na+ conductance without altering K+ conductance.[A177988] This reduces the driving force for potassium movement into the tubular lumen and thus decreases potassium excretion. [A178054] Triamterene is similar in action to [amiloride] but, unlike amiloride, increases the urinary excretion of magnesium.[A178039]"
204,"For the treatment of all forms of Parkinson's Disease, as well as control of extrapyramidal reactions induced by antipsychotic agents.A muscarinic antagonist that crosses the blood-brain barrier and is used in the treatment of drug-induced extrapyramidal disorders and in parkinsonism.Procyclidine has an atropine-like action on parasympathetic-innervated peripheral structures including smooth muscle. It's antispasmodic effects are thought to be related to the blockage of central cholinergic receptors M1, M2 and M4. It is used to treat symptomatic Parkinsonism and extrapyramidal dysfunction caused by antipsychotic agents.The mechanism of action is unknown. It is thought that Procyclidine acts by blocking central cholinergic receptors, and thus balancing cholinergic and dopaminergic activity in the basal ganglia. Many of its effects are due to its pharmacologic similarities with atropine. Procyclidine exerts an antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle, and may produce mydriasis and reduction in salivation."
205,"Phenylephrine is available in various drug formulations, which have different indications. Phenylephrine injections are indicated to treat hypotension caused by shock or anesthesia.[L9416, L9410] The ophthalmic formulation is indicated to induce mydriasis [L9413, L46332] and conjunctival vasoconstriction.[A187370] The intranasal formulation is used to treat congestion, and a topical formulation is used to treat hemorrhoids.[A187370] Off-label uses include priapism and induction of local vasoconstriction.[A187370]Phenylephrine is an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonist used to treat hypotension,[L9416,L9410] dilate the pupil,[L9413] and induce local vasoconstriction.[A187370] The action of phenylephrine, or neo-synephrine, was first described in literature in the 1930s.[A187376]    Phenylephrine was granted FDA approval in 1939.[L9413]Phenylephrine is an alpha-1 adrenergic agonist that raises blood pressure,[L9416,L9410] dilates the pupils,[L9413] and causes local vasoconstriction.[A187370] Ophthalmic formulations of phenylephrine act for 3-8 hours[L9413] while intravenous solutions have an effective half life of 5 minutes and an elimination half life of 2.5 hours.[A187379,L9416] Patients taking ophthalmic formulations of phenylephrine should be counselled about the risk of arrhythmia, hypertension, and rebound miosis.[L9413] Patients taking an intravenous formulation should be counselled regarding the risk of bradycardia, allergic reactions, extravasation causing necrosis or tissue sloughing, and the concomitant use of oxytocic drugs.[L9416,L9410]Phenylephrine is an alpha-1 adrenergic agonist that mediates vasoconstriction[A187370] and mydriasis[L9413] depending on the route and location of administration. Systemic exposure to phenylephrine also leads to agonism of alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, raising systolic and diastolic pressure as well as peripheral vascular resistance.[L9416,L9410] Increased blood pressure stimulates the vagus nerve, causing reflex bradycardia.[L9416,L9410]"
206,"For the treatment of hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis. It is also used to prepare patients for thyroidectomy.An imidazole antithyroid agent. Carbimazole is metabolized to methimazole, which is responsible for the antithyroid activity.Carbimazole is a carbethoxy derivative of methimazole. Its antithyroid action is due to its conversion to methimazole after absorption. It is used to treat hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis.Carbimazole is an aitithyroid agent that decreases the uptake and concentration of inorganic iodine by thyroid, it also reduces the formation of di-iodotyrosine and thyroxine. Once converted to its active form of methimazole, it prevents the thyroid peroxidase enzyme from coupling and iodinating the tyrosine residues on thyroglobulin, hence reducing the production of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4."
207,"Digoxin is indicated in the following conditions: 1) For the treatment of mild to moderate heart failure in adult patients.[L9143] 2) To increase myocardial contraction in children diagnosed with heart failure.[L9143] 3) To maintain control ventricular rate in adult patients diagnosed with chronic atrial fibrillation.[L9143]    In adults with heart failure, when it is clinically possible, digoxin should be administered in conjunction with a diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor for optimum effects.[L9143]    Digoxin is one of the oldest cardiovascular medications used today.[A178225] It is a common agent used to manage atrial fibrillation and the symptoms of heart failure.[A178234] Digoxin is classified as a cardiac glycoside and was initially approved by the FDA in 1954.[L9143]    This drug originates from the foxglove plant, also known as the _Digitalis_ plant[T610], studied by William Withering, an English physician and botanist in the 1780s.[A178237,A178240] Prior to this, a Welsh family, historically referred to as the _Physicians of Myddvai_, formulated drugs from this plant. They were one of the first to prescribe cardiac glycosides, according to ancient literature dating as early as the 1250s.[A178240]Digoxin is a positive inotropic and negative chronotropic drug[A178234], meaning that it increases the force of the heartbeat and decreases the heart rate.[L6253] The decrease in heart rate is particularly useful in cases of atrial fibrillation, a condition characterized by a fast and irregular heartbeat.[A178282] The relief of heart failure symptoms during digoxin therapy has been demonstrated in clinical studies by increased exercise capacity and reduced hospitalization due to heart failure and reduced heart failure-related emergency medical visits.[L9143] Digoxin has a narrow therapeutic window.[L9143]    **A note on cardiovascular risk**    Digoxin poses a risk of rapid ventricular response that can cause ventricular fibrillation in patients with an accessory atrioventricular (AV) pathway. Cardiac arrest as a result of ventricular fibrillation is fatal.[L9143] An increased risk of fatal severe or complete heart block is present in individuals with pre-existing sinus node disease and AV block who take digoxin.[L9143]    Digoxin exerts hemodynamic, electrophysiologic, and neurohormonal effects on the cardiovascular system.[A178234] It reversibly inhibits the Na-K ATPase enzyme, leading to various beneficial effects.  The Na-K ATPase enzyme functions to maintain the intracellular environment by regulating the entry and exit of sodium, potassium, and calcium (indirectly). Na-K ATPase is also known as the _sodium pump_[L9143]. The inhibition of the sodium pump by digoxin increases intracellular sodium and increases the calcium level in the myocardial cells, causing an increased contractile force of the heart.[L9143,A178264] This improves the left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), an important measure of cardiac function.[A178234,T613]    Digoxin also stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system via the vagus nerve[T607] leading to sinoatrial (SA) and atrioventricular (AV) node effects, decreasing the heart rate.[L9143,A178234] Part of the pathophysiology of heart failure includes neurohormonal activation, leading to an increase in norepinephrine. Digoxin helps to decrease norepinephrine levels through activation of the parasympathetic nervous system.[A178234]"
208,"Sulpiride is indicated for the treatment of acute and chronic schizophrenia.[L31933]Sulpiride first appeared in published literature in 1967.[A229538] Clinical studies show a greater effect on treating the negative symptoms of schizophrenia rather than positive symptoms at low doses, though the effects are more equal at higher doses.[A229683]    Sulpiride is not approved by the FDA, Health Canada, or the EMA; though it is approved in individual European countries.[L24679]Sulpiride is a substituted benzamide derivative and a selective dopamine D2 antagonist indicated to treat acute and chronic schizophrenia.[A229678,A229683,A229688,L31933] It has a short duration of action as it is given twice daily, and a wide therapeutic window as patients have survived single doses as high as 16g.[L31933] Patients should be counselled regarding increased motor agitation, extrapyramidal reactions, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome.[L31933]Sulpiride is a selective dopamine D2 and D3 receptor antagonist.[A229678,A229683,A229688] _In silico_ studies show that sulpiride may interact with the Asp-119 and Phe-417 amino acid residues of these receptors.[A229688] It is estimated that D2 receptors should be 65-80% occupied for optimal treatment and minimal adverse effects.[A229693]"
209,"Profenamine is indicated in the symptomatic treatment of drug-induced extrapyramidal reactions and of the manifestations (rigidity, akinesia, sialorrhea, oculogyric crisis, tremor, etc.) of Parkinson's disease of encephalitic, arteriosclerotic or idiopathic origin.[L46812] It is also used to control severe reactions to certain medicines such as reserpine.Profenamine (also known as ethopropazine) is a medication derived from phenothiazine. It is primarily used as an antidyskinetic to treat Parkinsonism. It is sold under the trade name Parsitan in Canada.[L46812] In the US, the marketing of profenamine has been discontinued.[L46817]Profenamine, a phenothiazine and antidyskinetic, is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. By improving muscle control and reducing stiffness, this drug permits more normal movements of the body as the disease symptoms are reduced. Unlike other NMDA antagonists, profenamine &mdash; because of its anticholinergic action &mdash; is largely devoid of neurotoxic side effects. Profenamine also has a slight antihistaminic and local anesthetic effect.Profenamine's anti-Parkinson action can be attributed to its anticholinergic properties. Profenamine partially blocks central (striatal) cholinergic receptors, thereby helping to balance cholinergic and dopaminergic activity in the basal ganglia; salivation may be decreased, and smooth muscle may be relaxed. Drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms and those due to parkinsonism may be relieved, but tardive dyskinesia is not alleviated and may be aggravated by anticholinergic effects. Profenamine's local anesthetic effect is due to its antagonism of the NMDA glutamate receptor. Glutamate is recognized as an important transmitter in nociceptive pathways, and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of the glutamate receptor, in particular, has been implicated in the mediation of neuropathic pain. Excessive release of glutamate at NMDA receptors on dorsal horn neurons of the spinal cord results in hyperactivation and hypersensitivity of these receptors (perceived as hyperalgesia), thought to be an integral feature of neuropathic pain."
210,"For use as an adjunct to improve neurologic outcome following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) from ruptured intracranial berry aneurysms by reducing the incidence and severity of ischemic deficits.Nimodipine is a 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. It acts primarily on vascular smooth muscle cells by stabilizing voltage-gated L-type calcium channels in their inactive conformation. By inhibiting the influx of calcium in smooth muscle cells, nimodipine prevents calcium-dependent smooth muscle contraction and subsequent vasoconstriction. Compared to other calcium channel blocking agents, nimodipine exhibits greater effects on cerebral circulation than on peripheral circulation. Nimodipine is used to as an adjunct to improve the neurologic outcome following subarachnoid hemorrhage from ruptured intracranial aneurysm.Nimodipine belongs to the class of pharmacological agents known as calcium channel blockers. Nimodipine is indicated for the improvement of neurological outcome by reducing the incidence and severity of ischemic deficits in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage from ruptured congenital aneurysms who are in good neurological condition post-ictus (e.g., Hunt and Hess Grades I-III). The contractile processes of smooth muscle cells are dependent upon calcium ions, which enter these cells during depolarization as slow ionic transmembrane currents. Nimodipine inhibits calcium ion transfer into these cells and thus inhibits contractions of vascular smooth muscle. In animal experiments, nimodipine had a greater effect on cerebral arteries than on arteries elsewhere in the body perhaps because it is highly lipophilic, allowing it to cross the blood brain barrier. Although the precise mechanism of action is not known, nimodipine blocks intracellular influx of calcium through voltage-dependent and receptor-operated slow calcium channels across the membranes of myocardial, vascular smooth muscle, and neuronal cells. By specifically binding to L-type voltage-gated calcium channels, nimodipine inhibits the calcium ion transfer, resulting in the inhibition of vascular smooth muscle contraction. Evidence suggests that the dilation of small cerebral resistance vessels, with a resultant increase in collateral circulation, and/or a direct effect involving the prevention of calcium overload in neurons may be responsible for nimodipine's clinical effect in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage."
211,"Indicated for oral inhalation use in the maintenance treatment of asthma as prophylactic therapy in patients 5 years of age and older. The aerosol form of beclomethasone diproprionate is not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm.[L6871]    Indicated for intranasal use to relieve the symptoms of seasonal or perennial allergic and nonallergic (vasomotor) rhinitis and prevent the recurrence of nasal polyps following surgical removal.[L6880]    Indicated for the relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses in patients 13 years of age and older.[L10782] Corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses include psoriasis, contact dermatitis (dermatitis venenata), atopic dermatitis (infantile eczema, allergic dermatitis), neurodermatitis (lichen simplex chronicus, lichen planus, eczema, eczematous dermatitis), intertrigo, dyshidroses (pompholyx), seborrheic dermatitis, exfoliative dermatitis, solar dermatitis, stasis dermatitis, and anogenital and senile pruritus.[L6886]Beclomethasone dipropionate is a second-generation[A179842] synthetic corticosteroid and diester of beclomethasone, which is structurally similar to [dexamethasone].[L6871] It is a prodrug of an active metabolite beclomethasone 17-monopropionate (17-BMP)[A179839] which acts on the glucocorticoid receptor to mediates its therapeutic action. Beclomethasone dipropionate itself posesses weak glucocorticoid receptor binding affinity and is rapidly converted into 17-BMP upon administration.[A179839] Formulations for oral inhalation, intranasal, and topical use are available for beclomethasone dipropionate. Beclomethasone dipropionate became first available in a pressurized metered-dose inhaler in 1972 and later in a dry powder inhaler and an aqueous nasal spray.[A179839] Due to its anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and anti-allergy properties, beclomethasone dipropionate is used in various inflammatory conditions, such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and dermatoses to reduce symptoms. When inhaled, it is proposed that beclomethasone dipropionate remains active locally in the lung without causing significant side effects associated with systemic corticosteroids.[A180010] Compared to earlier corticosteroids such as [dexamethasone] and [prednisolone], beclomethasone dipropionate is reported to be less irritating to the nasal mucosa with a longer duration of action when administered intranasally.[A179848]Inflammatory conditions, including asthma, dermatoses, and allergic rhinitis, involve the activation of cascades by inflammatory mediators. Inflammation is a primary defense mechanism and the homeostatic response of the immune system; however, a prolonged inflammatory response in certain disorders may lead to tissue damage, pain, and swelling. Beclomethasone dipropionate works by attenuating the inflammatory responses associated with asthma, allergic rhinitis, nasal polyps, and corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses. It suppresses the actions of inflammatory cells, such as mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils. It also inhibits the release of inflammatory mediators, such as histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines.[L6871] Beclomethasone dipropionate is reported to exhibit potent topical activity while possessing low systemic effects.[A179845]     Beclomethasone dipropionate is a corticosteroid drug with anti-inflammatory and vasoconstrictive effects used to treat chronic inflammatory processes such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses. When inhaled, it improves lung function, decreases airway hyper-reactivity, and reduces the severity of asthmatic symptoms.[A180160] Although inhaled corticosteroids, including beclomethasone dipropionate, are reported to mainly act locally in the lungs, systemic effects such as disruption of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function, bone turnover, osteoporosis, and growth suppression may still be observed with chronic use or high dose administration. There were varying findings from clinical studies examining the effect of beclomethasone dipropionate on growth suppression in pediatric patients.[A180160] It was shown to suppress the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in a dose-dependent manner.[A179917] HPA axis is a central hormonal response system to stress and activation of HPA axis leads to the production of endogenous steroid hormone production.[A179920] Long-term use of high-dose systemic corticosteroids, including those inhaled, was often associated with signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to stress conditions, such as trauma, surgery, or infections. As corticosteroids work by suppressing the immune system, there may be an increased risk for developing infections.[L6871] Cases of _Candida albicans_ infection of the mouth and throat have been reported with inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate therapy.[A180010]Beclomethasone dipropionate is a corticosteroid and prodrug that is rapidly activated by hydrolysis to the active monoester, 17 monopropionate (17-BMP), which mediates anti-inflammatory actions. 17-BMP has been shown _in vitro_ to exhibit a binding affinity for the human glucocorticoid receptor which is approximately 13 times that of dexamethasone and 25 times that of beclomethasone dipropionate.[L6871] Upon binding of the ligand, the glucocorticoid receptors dimerize and translocate into the nucleus, where they subsequently bind to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) on glucocorticoid-responsive genes, leading to changes in transcription. There are several proposed mechanisms for the anti-inflammatory action of corticosteroids. Corticosteroids may work by increasing the transcription of genes coding for anti-inflammatory proteins, including lipocortin-1 and interleukin-10.[A179875] Corticosteroids were also shown to inhibit the expression of multiple genes that encode pro-inflammatory factors, such as cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules, that are activated during the chronic inflammatory process.[A31449] This is thought to be due to the direct inhibitory interaction between activated glucocorticoid receptors and activated pro-inflammatory transcription factors, such as nuclear factor-kappa B and activator protein-1.[A179875] Chronic inflammation is often characterized by enhanced expression of these transcription factors that bind to and activate coactivator molecules, which then acetylate core histones to switch on gene transcription to further amplify the inflammatory process.[A31449] Corticosteroids suppress the multiple inflammatory gene expression by promoting histone deacetylation, resulting in tighter coiling of DNA and reduced access of transcription factors to their binding sites.[A179875] "
212,"Carisoprodol is indicated for the relief of discomfort related to acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions [FDA label].      **Important limitations of use** [FDA label]:    �?Should only be used for acute treatment periods up to two or three weeks     �?Adequate evidence of effectiveness for more prolonged use has not been established     �?Not recommended in pediatric patients less than 16 years of ageOriginally approved by the FDA in 1959 [FDA label], carisoprodol is a centrally acting muscle relaxant used in painful musculoskeletal conditions in conjunction with physical therapy and other medications [A176047].

Clinical studies have shown that this drug causes impairment of psychomotor performance in neuropsychological tests.[A176062, A176095]The mechanism of action of carisoprodol in relieving discomfort associated with acute painful musculoskeletal conditions has not been confirmed.  In studies using animal models, the muscle relaxation that is induced by carisoprodol is associated with a change in the interneuronal activity of the spinal cord and of the descending reticular formation, located in the brain.[FDA label]     The abuse potential of this drug is attributed to its ability to alter GABAA function.[A176077] This drug has been shown to modulate a variety of GABAA receptor subunits.[A176062, A176068]  GABAA receptor modulation can lead to anxiolysis due to inhibitory effects on neurotransmission.[A173848]"

They are also indicated for use in secondary amenorrhea [FDA label].     **Vaginal gel**    Progesterone gel (8%) is indicated as progesterone supplementation or replacement as part of an Assisted Reproductive Technology (“ART�? treatment for infertile women with progesterone deficiency.  The lower concentration progesterone gel (4%) is used in the treatment of secondary amenorrhea, with the use of the 8% concentration if there is no therapeutic response to the 4% gel [F3898].    **Vaginal insert**    This form is indicated to support embryo implantation and early pregnancy by supplementation of corpus luteal function as part of an Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) treatment program for infertile women [F3901].    **Injection (intramuscular)**    This drug is indicated in amenorrhea and abnormal uterine bleeding due to hormonal imbalance in the absence of organic pathology, such as submucous fibroids or uterine cancer [F3907].     **Tablets, contraceptive**    The tablet form of progesterone in contraceptive formulations is indicated for the prevention of pregnancy [F3904]. Progesterone is a hormone that occurs naturally in females, and is essential for endometrial receptivity, embryo implantation, and the successful establishment of pregnancy. A low progesterone concentration or an insufficient response to progesterone can cause infertility and pregnancy loss [A175609]. Progesterone is used in various contraceptive preparations to prevent ovulation and fertilization [T481], [A175612] as well as in other formulations to promote and support pregnancy.  Please see [Medroxyprogesterone acetate], [Megestrol acetate], [Dydrogesterone] and [Hydroxyprogesterone] entries for information on various other forms of progesterone.    Pharmaceutical progesterone is made from a plant source as a starting material and is chemically identical to progesterone of human ovarian origin [FDA label]. Progesterone is available in gelatinized capsule form, vaginal gel form, tablet form, vaginal insert form, and injection form, all used for various purposes [Label,F3898,F3904,F3901,F3907].Progesterone, depending on concentration and dosage form, and timing of exposure may have several pharmacodynamic effects.  These actions, according, to various preparations, are listed below:    General effects    Progesterone is the main hormone of the corpus luteum and the placenta. It acts on the uterus by changing the proliferative phase to the secretory phase of the endometrium (inner mucous lining of the uterus).   This hormone, stimulated by a hormone called _luteinizing hormone_ (LH) is the main hormone during the secretory phase to prepare the corpus luteum and the endometrium for implantation of a fertilized ovum. As the luteal phase concludes, the progesterone hormone sends negative feedback to the anterior pituitary gland in the brain to decrease FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) and LH (luteinizing hormone) levels. This prevents ovulation and maturation of oocytes (immature egg cells). The endometrium then prepares for pregnancy by increasing its vascularity (blood vessels) and stimulating mucous secretion. This process occurs by progesterone stimulating the endometrium to decrease endometrial proliferation, leading to a decreased uterine lining thickness, developing more complex uterine glands, collecting energy in the form of glycogen, and providing more uterine blood vessel surface area suitable for supporting a growing embryo. As opposed to cervical mucous changes observed during the proliferative phase and ovulation, progesterone decreases and thickens the cervical mucus, rendering it less elastic. This change occurs because the fertilization time period has passed, and a specific consistency of mucous amenable to sperm entry is no longer required [T490].    **Gelatinized capsules**    Progesterone capsules are an oral dosage form of micronized progesterone which, chemically identical to progesterone of ovarian origin. Progesterone capsules have all the properties of endogenous progesterone with induction of a secretory phase endometrium with gestagenic, antiestrogenic, slightly antiandrogenic and anti-aldosterone effects [F3913]. Progesterone opposes the effects of estrogen on the uterus, and is beneficial in women with unopposed estrogen exposure, which carries an increased risk of malignancy [F3913].      **Vaginal gel and vaginal insert**     The gel preparation mimics the effects of naturally occurring progesterone. In the presence of adequate levels of estrogen, progesterone converts a proliferative endometrium into secretory endometrium. This means that the endometrium changes from a growing and thickening stage into a subsequent preparation stage for pregnancy, which involves further preparatory changes. Progesterone is necessary for the development of decidual tissue (specialized tissue amenable to supporting a possible pregnancy). Progesterone is required to increase endometrial receptivity for the implantation of a fertilized embryo. Once an embryo is implanted, progesterone helps to maintain the pregnancy [F3898].       **Injection (intramuscular)**     Intramuscularly injected progesterone increases serum progesterone and aids in the prevention of endometrial tissue overgrowth due to unopposed estrogen (which leads to abnormal uterine bleeding and sometimes uterine cancer) [L5638], [F3916]. In the absence or deficiency of progesterone, the endometrium continually proliferates, eventually outgrowing its limited blood supply, shedding incompletely, and leading to abnormal and/or profuse bleeding as well as malignancy [L5638].    **Tablets, contraceptive**    Progesterone-only contraceptive tablets prevent conception by suppressing ovulation in about half of users, causing a thickening of cervical mucus to inhibit sperm movement, lowering the midcycle LH and FSH hormone peaks, slowing the movement of the ovum through the fallopian tubes, and causing secretory changes in the endometrium as described above [F3904].Progesterone binds and activates its nuclear receptor, _PR_, which plays an important part in the signaling of stimuli that maintain the endometrium during its preparation for pregnancy.    Progesterone receptor (PR) is a member of the nuclear/steroid hormone receptor (SHR) family of ligand-dependent transcription factors that is expressed primarily in female reproductive tissue as well as the central nervous system. As a result of its binding its associated steroid hormone, progesterone, the progesterone receptor (PR) modulates the expression of genes that regulate the development, differentiation, and proliferation of target tissues [A175666]. In humans, PR is found to be highly expressed in the stromal (connective tissue) cells during the secretory phase and during pregnancy [A175651].     Progesterone may prevent pregnancy by changing the consistency of cervical mucus to be unfavorable for sperm penetration, and by inhibiting follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which normally causes ovulation.  With perfect use, the first-year failure rate for progestin-only oral contraceptives is approximately 0.5%. The typical failure rate, however, is estimated to be approximately 5%, due to late or missed pills [F3904]."

It attenuated tumour growth of human tumour xenografts in immunocompromised mice, reduced tumour angiogenesis, and increased tumour apoptosis in models of hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, and differentiated thyroid carcinoma.[A255852,L9341] Some studies suggest that sorafenib induces apoptosis in several tumour cell lines, although this effect is inconsistent across cell lines.[A255852] Antiviral effects of sorafenib have been documented, as it was shown to inhibit hepatitis C viral replication _in vitro_.[A255852]Kinases are involved in tumour cell signalling, proliferation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis.[A14794,L9341] Sorafenib inhibits multiple intracellular serine/threonine kinases in the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathway. Intracellular Raf serine/threonine kinase isoforms inhibited by sorafenib include Raf-1 (or C-Raf), wild-type B-Raf, and mutant B-Raf. Sorafenib inhibits cell surface tyrosine kinase receptors such as KIT, FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT-3), RET, RET/PTC, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR-1), VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (PDGFR-β).[A255852,A255857,A14794,L9341]     Sorafenib is thought to exhibit a dual mechanism of action: it blocks tumour proliferation and growth by inhibiting the RAF/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway on tumour cells, and reduces tumour angiogenesis by inhibiting VEGFR and PDGFR signalling in tumour vasculature.[A255852,A10489]"

Bone resorption by osteoclasts causes local acidification, releasing the bisphosphonate, which is taken into the osteoclast by fluid-phase endocytosis.[A959] Endocytic vesicles become acidified, releasing bisphosphonates into the cytosol of osteoclasts where they act.[A959]    Osteoclasts mediate resorption of bone.[A6366] When osteoclasts bind to bone they form podosomes, ring structures of F-actin.[A6366] Etidronic acid also inhibits V-ATPases in the osteoclast, though the exact subunits are unknown, preventing F-actin from forming podosomes.[A202229,A202247,A203360] Disruption of the podosomes causes osteoclasts to detach from bones, preventing bone resorption.[A6366]    Nitrogen containing bisphosphonates such as zoledronate are known to induce apoptosis of hematopoietic tumor cells by inhibiting the components of the mevalonate pathway farnesyl diphosphate synthase, farnesyl diphosphate, and geranylgeranyl diphosphate.[A202769,A203123] These components are essential for post-translational prenylation of GTP-binding proteins like Rap1.[A202769,A203123] The lack of prenylation of these proteins interferes with their function, and in the case of Rap1, leads to apoptosis.[A202769,A203123] zoledronate also activated caspases which further contribute to apoptosis.[A202769,A203123]"

Griseofulvin may be given by mouth in the treatment of tinea infections.Griseofulvin is a mycotoxic metabolic product of Penicillium spp.It was the first available oral agent for the treatment of dermatophytoses and has now been used for more than forty years. Griseofulvin is fungistatic with in vitro activity against various species of Microsporum Epidermophyton, and Trichophyton. It has no effect on bacteria or on other genera of fungi. Following oral administration, griseofulvin is deposited in the keratin precursor cells and has a greater affinity for diseased tissue. The drug is tightly bound to the new keratin which becomes highly resistant to fungal invasions. Once the keratin-Griseofulvin complex reaches the skin site of action, it binds to fungal microtubules (tubulin) thus altering fungal mitosis.Griseofulvin is fungistatic, however the exact mechanism by which it inhibits the growth of dermatophytes is not clear. It is thought to inhibit fungal cell mitosis and nuclear acid synthesis. It also binds to and interferes with the function of spindle and cytoplasmic microtubules by binding to alpha and beta tubulin. It binds to keratin in human cells, then once it reaches the fungal site of action, it binds to fungal microtubes thus altering the fungal process of mitosis."
217,"For the treatment of hypertension.Nisoldipine is a 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. It acts primarily on vascular smooth muscle cells by stabilizing voltage-gated L-type calcium channels in their inactive conformation. By inhibiting the influx of calcium in smooth muscle cells, nisoldipine prevents calcium-dependent smooth muscle contraction and subsequent vasoconstriction. Nisoldipine may be used in alone or in combination with other agents in the management of hypertension.Nisoldipine, a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker, is used alone or with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, to treat hypertension, chronic stable angina pectoris, and Prinzmetal's variant angina. Nisoldipine is similar to other peripheral vasodilators. Nisoldipine inhibits the influx of extra cellular calcium across the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes possibly by deforming the channel, inhibiting ion-control gating mechanisms, and/or interfering with the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The decrease in intracellular calcium inhibits the contractile processes of the myocardial smooth muscle cells, causing dilation of the coronary and systemic arteries, increased oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue, decreased total peripheral resistance, decreased systemic blood pressure, and decreased afterload.By deforming the channel, inhibiting ion-control gating mechanisms, and/or interfering with the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, Nisoldipine inhibits the influx of extracellular calcium across the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes The decrease in intracellular calcium inhibits the contractile processes of the myocardial smooth muscle cells, causing dilation of the coronary and systemic arteries, increased oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue, decreased total peripheral resistance, decreased systemic blood pressure, and decreased afterload."

In addition, due to its CNS depressant effects, patients taking alprazolam should avoid operating heavy machinery or driving and should avoid other CNS depressants such as alcohol. As with other benzodiazepines, alprazolam carries a risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which is higher in predisposed individuals and may require strict monitoring. Cessation of therapy may result in acute or protracted withdrawal symptoms, which may be life-threatening; the patient dose should be gradually tapered whenever discontinuation or reduced dosage are necessary. Newborns born to mothers using alprazolam later in pregnancy may suffer from sedation and withdrawal symptoms. As CYP3A is required for the initial step in alprazolam metabolism, alprazolam is contraindicated in patients taking strong CYP3A inhibitors, such as ketoconazole and itraconazole; milder CYP3A inhibitors still necessitate alprazolam dosage adjustments. Lastly, benzodiazepines may have negative effects, such as panic disorders, increased suicide incidence, and episodes of mania/hypomania, in patients suffering from depression.[A18125, A236788, L34783, L34788]Neurotransmission relies on excitatory and inhibitory signalling. γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type-A receptors (GABAARs) are members of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (PLGIC) superfamily located synaptically and perisynaptically to mediate phasic inhibition and extrasynaptically to mediate tonic inhibition. GABAARs comprise a variety of subunits from a homologous family whose members are named based on sequence identity as one of α1-6, β1-3, γ1-3, δ, ε, θ, π, and ρ1-3. Each subunit possesses an extracellular (ECD), transmembrane (TMD), and intracellular (ICD) domain; inter-subunit interfaces are the primary points of neurotransmitter and modulator binding, described by coordination of the principal (+) and complementary (-) sites in each subunit. Binding of GABA to GABAA<Rs induces pore opening, rapid flow of chloride ions, and synaptic hyperpolarization, which in turn manifests as an inhibitory signal.[A236793, A236798]    The most prevalent GABAARs _in vivo_ are the α1β2γ2 receptors, which contain both GABA (β+/α-) and benzodiazepine (BZD, α+/γ-) binding sites in the intersubunit interfaces of the relevant subunits.[A236793, A236798, A236828] In general, any receptors containing an α<sub>x</sub>/γ<sub>z</sub> interface, where x = 1-3,5 and z = 1-3, have potential high-affinity BZD binding sites, although small sequence differences between subunits may alter binding affinity to individual molecules. The α4 and α6 subunits, in which an otherwise conserved histidine is replaced by arginine, do not bind traditional BZD ligands such as diazepam and hence are considered ""diazepam-insensitive"".[A236793, A236798, A236828] GABA binding results in a series of conformational changes in the ECDs of GABAAR β subunits, ""locking"" each to its neighbouring α- interface. The binding of alprazolam in the high-affinity BZD site stabilizes the α+/γ- interface and facilitates the conformational changes that lead to pore opening, hence functioning as a positive allosteric modulator.[A236833]    The exact manner in which GABAAR allosteric modulation mediates the therapeutic and unwanted effects of benzodiazepines remains unclear.[A177973, A18125] Earlier studies suggested that the primary factor was the α subunit composition, with α1-containing receptors mediating the sedative effects, α2/3-containing receptors the anxiolytic effects, and α5-containing receptors the memory effects of benzodiazepines.[A236838] More recent studies suggest a more complex set of factors including subunit composition, physiological location, neuronal circuit, and nerve cell type.[A236843] To further complicate matters, there may be up to five distinct BZD binding sites on GABAARs, with site 1 corresponding to the classical high-affinity α+/γ- interface. The effects of binding at sites 2-4 are not fully understood and likely impart greater complexity to benzodiazepine pharmacological action.[A236798, A236828]"
219,"For prevention of deep vein thrombosis, which may result in pulmonary embolism, following knee surgery.Ardeparin, marketed under the US trade name Normiflo, is a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) anticoagulant used for the prevention of postoperative venous thrombosis.

222,"Rosiglitazone is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Rosiglitazone is an anti-diabetic drug in the thiazolidinedione class of drugs. It is marketed by the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline as a stand-alone drug (Avandia) and in combination with metformin (Avandamet) or with glimepiride (Avandaryl). Like other thiazolidinediones, the mechanism of action of rosiglitazone is by activation of the intracellular receptor class of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), specifically PPARγ. Rosiglitazone is a selective ligand of PPARγ, and has no PPARα-binding action. Apart from its effect on insulin resistance, it appears to have an anti-inflammatory effect: nuclear factor kappa-B (NFκB) levels fall and inhibitor (IκB) levels increase in patients on rosiglitazone. Recent research has suggested that rosiglitazone may also be of benefit to a subset of patients with Alzheimer's disease not expressing the ApoE4 allele. This is the subject of a clinical trial currently underway.When rosiglitazone is used as monotherapy, it is associated with increases in total cholesterol, LDL, and HDL. It is also associated with decreases in free fatty acids. Increases in LDL occurred primarily during the first 1 to 2 months of therapy with AVANDIA and LDL levels remained elevated above baseline throughout the trials. In contrast, HDL continued to rise over time. As a result, the LDL/HDL ratio peaked after 2 months of therapy and then appeared to decrease over time. Rosiglitazone acts as a highly selective and potent agonist at peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPAR) in target tissues for insulin action such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver. Activation of PPAR-gamma receptors regulates the transcription of insulin-responsive genes involved in the control of glucose production, transport, and utilization. In this way, rosiglitazone enhances tissue sensitivity to insulin."
223,"This drug is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson’s disease [FDA label].  This drug can be administered as monotherapy or in conjunction with levodopa. It is also indicated for symptomatic treatment of moderate to severe primary Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) [FDA label].  Pramipexole is a drug used to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's Disease (PD).  It is a _non-ergot dopamine agonist_ drug that is efficacious in treating various Parkinson's symptoms such as tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia (slow movement) [A176867]. It was first approved by the FDA in 1997 [L5882]. Parkinson's Disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders and causes a high level of disability in patients [A176855], leading to increased difficulty in performing activities of daily living due to symptoms that progress over time [A176858]. The prevalence of Parkinson's Disease worldwide has increased from approximately 2.5 million in 1990 to about 6.1 million in 2016 [A176861].  This increase may be attributed to an aging population along with other contributing factors [A176861].    In addition to the above FDA approval for Parkinson's Disease, pramipexole was also approved by the FDA in 2006 for the treatment of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) [A176873]. RLS is a sleep-related disorder characterized by unpleasant sensations in the lower extremities, often accompanied by an uncontrollable urge to move the legs [A176876].**Parkinson's Disease**    Through the stimulation of dopamine receptors, pramipexole is thought to relieve the symptoms of Parkinson's Disease [FDA label]. The motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease occur partly due to a reduction of dopamine in the substantia nigra of the brain [A176894]. Dopamine is an essential neurotransmitter that has major effects on motor movements in humans.    **Restless Legs Syndrome**    Pramipexole likely restores balance to the dopaminergic system, controlling the symptoms of this condition. Restless legs syndrome is thought to occur, in part, through dysfunction of the dopaminergic system, resulting in unpleasant lower extremity symptoms [A176876], [F4301].     **Other effects**    In addition to the abovementioned effects, animal studies demonstrate that pramipexole blocks dopamine synthesis, release, and turnover. Additionally, this drug is neuroprotective to dopamine neuron degeneration after ischemia or methamphetamine neurotoxicity [F4301]. The exact mechanism of action of pramipexole as a treatment for Parkinson's disease is unknown at this time. It is thought, however, that the ability of pramipexole to cause stimulation of the dopamine receptors in the striatum of the brain, a region that receives a vast array of neurological input and is responsible for a wide variety of functions, may be involved[A176891].  Studies performed in animals show that pramipexole influences striatal neuronal transmission rates following activation of dopamine receptors  [FDA label].     Pramipexole is considered a non-ergot dopamine agonist that shows specificity and strong activity at the D2 subfamily of dopamine receptors in vitro, binding selectively and dopamine D2 receptors and showing a preference for the dopamine D3 receptor subtype rather than other subtypes [A176873]. The clinical significance of this binding specificity is unknown [FDA label], [A176873].   "
224,"Used in the management of diabetes mellitus type 2 (adult-onset).A sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agent that is metabolized in the liver to 1-hydrohexamide. Acetohexamide has been discontinued in the US market.Acetohexamide is an intermediate-acting, first-generation oral sulfonylurea. It lowers blood sugar by stimulating the pancreatic beta cells to secrete insulin and by helping the body use insulin efficiently. Due to its primary action on the pancreatic beta cells, the drug is only effective when there are functional pancreatic beta cells that can produce insulin granules. Acetohexamide has one-third the potency of chlorpropamide, and twice the potency of tolbutamide; however, similar hypoglycemic efficacy occurs with equipotent dosage of sulfonylureas.Sulfonylureas such as acetohexamide bind to an ATP-dependent K+ channel on the cell membrane of pancreatic beta cells. This inhibits a tonic, hyperpolarizing outflux of potassium, which causes the electric potential over the membrane to become more positive. This depolarization opens voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. The rise in intracellular calcium leads to increased fusion of insulin granulae with the cell membrane, and therefore increased secretion of (pro)insulin."

The name ""penicillin"" can either refer to several variants of penicillin available, or to the group of antibiotics derived from the penicillins. Ampicillin has <i>in vitro</i> activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The bactericidal activity of Ampicillin results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis and is mediated through Ampicillin binding to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). Ampicillin is stable against hydrolysis by a variety of beta-lactamases, including penicillinases, and cephalosporinases and extended spectrum beta-lactamases.By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, Ampicillin inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that Ampicillin interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."
226,"Indicated for the treatment of mild to moderately severe infections due to penicillin G­-sensitive microorganisms, with the use of bacteriological studies (including sensitivity tests) and clinical response.[label]     Phenoxymethylpenicillin may be used for the treatment of:     - mild to moderate infections of the upper respiratory tract, scarlet fever, and mild erysipelas caused by Streptococcus without bacteremia  - mild to moderately severe infections of the respiratory tract caused by Pneumococcus  - mild infections of the skin and soft tissues caused by penicillin G-sensitive Staphylococcus  - mild to moderately severe infections of the oropharynx caused by Fusospirochetosis, including Vincent’s gingivitis and pharyngitis, usually respond to oral penicillin therapy    **Off-label**    Indicated for use as prophylaxis against bacterial endocarditis in patients with congenital heart disease or rheumatic or other acquired valvular heart disease when they undergo dental procedures and surgical procedures of the upper respiratory tract.[label]Phenoxymethylpenicillin is a narrow spectrum antibiotic also commonly referred to as Penicillin V or Penicillin VK.[A178609] It is a phenoxymethyl analog of Penicillin G, or [benzylpenicillin]. An orally active naturally penicillin, phenoxymethylpenicillin is used to treat mild to moderate infections in the respiratory tract, skin, and soft tissues caused by penicillin G­-sensitive microorganisms. Phenoxymethylpenicillin has also be used in some cases as prophylaxis against susceptible organisms. While there have been no controlled clinical efficacy studies that were conducted, phenoxymethylpenicillin has been suggested by the American Heart Association and the American Dental Association for use as an oral regimen for prophylaxis against bacterial endocarditis in patients with congenital heart disease or rheumatic or other acquired valvular heart disease when they undergo dental procedures and surgical procedures of the upper respiratory tract, except for those who are at an elevated risk for endocarditis.[label]Phenoxymethylpenicillin works against penicillin-sensitive microorganisms with bactericidal effects. It targets the bacteria during its active multiplication stage by interfering with bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan synthesis. _In vitro_, phenoxymethylpenicillin was shown to be active against staphylococci (except penicillinase-producing strains), streptococci (groups A, C, G, H, L and M), and pneumococci, as well as _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, _Bacillus anthracis_, Clostridia, _Actinomyces bovis_, _Streptobacillus moniliformis_, _Listeria monocytogenes_, _Leptospira_, _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_, and _Treponema pallidum_.[label]Phenoxymethylpenicillin inhibits the biosynthesis of cell wall mucopeptide [label] by binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, which are critical in the cell wall synthesis and maintenance, as well as cell division.[L6412] This disrupts the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. This subsequently leads to cell lysis.[L6412]"
227,"For the Short-term treatment of intractable insomnia for patients habituated to barbituratesSecobarbital (marketed by Eli Lilly and Company under the brand names Seconal and Tuinal) is a barbiturate derivative drug with anaesthetic, anticonvulsant, sedative and hypnotic properties. It is commonly known as quinalbarbitone in the United Kingdom.Secobarbital, a barbiturate, is used for the induction of anesthesia prior to the use of other general anesthetic agents and for induction of anesthesia for short surgical, diagnostic, or therapeutic procedures associated with minimal painful stimuli. Little analgesia is conferred by barbiturates; their use in the presence of pain may result in excitation.Secobarbital binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl- ionopore at the GABAAreceptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl- ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged."
228,"Used as an adjunct for short term treatment of moderate and severe psychomotor agitation. Also used to treat agitation or restlessness in the elderly.A phenothiazine with actions similar to chlorpromazine but with less antipsychotic activity. It is primarily used in short-term treatment of disturbed behavior and as an antiemetic. It is currently not approved for use in the United States.Promazine belongs to a group of medications known as the phenothiazine antipsychotics. It acts by blocking a variety of receptors in the brain, particularly dopamine receptors. Dopamine is involved in transmitting signals between brain cells. When there is an excess amount of dopamine in the brain it causes over-stimulation of dopamine receptors. These receptors normally act to modify behaviour and over-stimulation may result in psychotic illness. Promazine hydrochloride blocks these receptors and stops them becoming over-stimulated, thereby helping to control psychotic illness. Promazine has weak extrapyramidal and autonomic side effects which lead to its use in the elderly, for restless or psychotic patients. Its anti-psychotic effect is also weaker and it is not useful in general psychiatry.Promazine is an antagonist at types 1, 2, and 4 dopamine receptors, 5-HT receptor types 2A and 2C, muscarinic receptors 1 through 5, alpha(1)-receptors, and histamine H1-receptors. Promazine's antipsychotic effect is due to antagonism at dopamine and serotonin type 2 receptors, with greater activity at serotonin 5-HT2 receptors than at dopamine type-2 receptors. This may explain the lack of extrapyramidal effects. Promazine does not appear to block dopamine within the tubero-infundibular tract, explaining the lower incidence of hyperprolactinemia than with typical antipsychotic agents or risperidone. Antagonism at muscarinic receptors, H1-receptors, and alpha(1)-receptors also occurs with promazine."

It is most commonly used to treat herpes zoster (shingles). Famciclovir is a prodrug of penciclovir with higher oral bioavailability.Famciclovir is a prodrug that undergoes rapid biotransformation to the active antiviral compound penciclovir. Penciclovir is an anti-viral drug which has inhibitory activity against herpes simplex virus types 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2) and varicella zoster virus (VZV). Therefore, herpes viral DNA synthesis and replication are selectively inhibited.Famciclovir undergoes rapid biotransformation to the active antiviral compound penciclovir, which has inhibitory activity against herpes simplex virus types 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2) and varicella zoster virus (VZV). In cells infected with HSV-1, HSV-2 or VZV, viral thymidine kinase phosphorylates penciclovir to a monophosphate form that, in turn, is converted to penciclovir triphosphate by cellular kinases. In vitro studies demonstrate that penciclovir triphosphate inhibits HSV-2 DNA polymerase competitively with deoxyguanosine triphosphate. Consequently, herpes viral DNA synthesis and, therefore, replication are selectively inhibited."
234,"For the symptomatic relief of seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis or nonallergic rhinitis; allergic conjunctivitis; and mild, uncomplicated allergic skin manifestations of urticaria and angioedema. Also used in combination with other agents for the symptomatic relief of symptoms associated with the common cold.First generation histamine H1 antagonist used in allergic rhinitis; asthma; and urticaria. It is a component of cough and cold medicines. It may cause drowsiness.In allergic reactions an allergen interacts with and cross-links surface IgE antibodies on mast cells and basophils. Once the mast cell-antibody-antigen complex is formed, a complex series of events occurs that eventually leads to cell-degranulation and the release of histamine (and other chemical mediators) from the mast cell or basophil. Once released, histamine can react with local or widespread tissues through histamine receptors. Histamine, acting on H1-receptors, produces pruritis, vasodilatation, hypotension, flushing, headache, tachycardia, and bronchoconstriction. Histamine also increases vascular permeability and potentiates pain. Triprolidine, is a histamine H1 antagonist that competes with histamine for the normal H1-receptor sites on effector cells of the gastrointestinal tract, blood vessels and respiratory tract. It provides effective, temporary relief of sneezing, watery and itchy eyes, and runny nose due to hay fever and other upper respiratory allergies. Triprolidine has anticholinergic and sedative effects.Triprolidine binds to the histamine H1 receptor. This blocks the action of endogenous histamine, which subsequently leads to temporary relief of the negative symptoms brought on by histamine."
235,"For the treatment of malignant neoplasms of pancreas (metastatic islet cell carcinoma).An antibiotic that is produced by Stretomyces achromogenes. It is used as an antineoplastic agent and to induce diabetes in experimental animals.Streptozocin is an antitumour antibiotic consisting of a nitrosourea moiety interposed between a methyl group and a glucosamine. Streptozocin is indicated in the treatment of metastatic islet cell carcinoma of the pancreas. Streptozocin inhibits DNA synthesis in bacterial and mammalian cells. In bacterial cells, a specific interaction with cytosine moieties leads to degradation of DNA. The biochemical mechanism leading to mammalian cell death has not been definitely established; streptozocin inhibits cell proliferation at a considerably lower level than that needed to inhibit precursor incorporation into DNA or to inhibit several of the enzymes involved in DNA synthesis. Although streptozocin inhibits the progression of cells into mitosis, no specific phase of the cell cycle is particularly sensitive to its lethal effects.Although its mechanism of action is not completely clear, streptozocin is known to inhibit DNA synthesis, interfere with biochemical reactions of NAD and NADH, and inhibit some enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis. Its activity appears to occur as a result of formation of methylcarbonium ions, which alkylate or bind with many intracellular molecular structures including nucleic acids. Its cytotoxic action is probably due to cross-linking of strands of DNA, resulting in inhibition of DNA synthesis."
236,"For aborting pregnancy between the 13th and 20th weeks of gestation as calculated from the first day of the last normal menstrual period and in the following conditions related to second trimester abortion: 1. Failure of expulsion of the fetus during the course of treatment by another method; 2. Premature rupture of membranes in intrauterine methods with loss of drug and insufficient or absent uterine activity; 3. Requirement of a repeat intrauterine instillation of drug for expulsion of the fetus; 4. Inadvertent or spontaneous rupture of membranes in the presence of a previable fetus and absence of adequate activity for expulsion. Also for the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony which has not responded to conventional methods of management.A nonsteroidal abortifacient agent that is effective in both the first and second trimesters of pregnancy.Carboprost tromethamine administered intramuscularly stimulates in the gravid uterus myometrial contractions similar to labor contractions at the end of a full term pregnancy. Whether or not these contractions result from a direct effect of carboprost on the myome-trium has not been determined. Nonetheless, they evacuate the products of conception from the uterus in most cases. Postpartum, the resultant myometrial contractions provide hemostasis at the site of placentation. Carboprost tromethamine also stimulates the smooth muscle of the human gastrointestinal tract. This activity may produce the vomiting or diarrhea or both that is common when carbo-prost tromethamine is used to terminate pregnancy and for use postpartum. In laboratory animals and also in humans carboprost tromethamine can elevate body temperature. With the clinical doses of carboprost trometh-amine used for the termination of pregnancy, and for use postpartum, some patients do experience transient temperature increases. In laboratory animals and in humans large doses of carboprost tromethamine can raise blood pressure, probably by contracting the vascular smooth muscle. With the doses of carboprost tromethamine used for terminating pregnancy, this effect has not been clinically significant. In laboratory animals and also in humans carboprost tromethamine can elevate body temperature. With the clinical doses of carboprost tromethamine used for the termination of pregnancy, some patients do experience temperature increases. In some patients, carboprost tromethamine may cause transient bronchoconstriction.Carboprost is a synthetic prostaglandin. It binds the prostaglandin E2 receptor, causing myometrial contractions, casuing the induction of labour or the expulsion of the placenta. Prostaglandins occur naturally in the body and act at several sites in the body including the womb (uterus). They act on the muscles of the womb, causing them to contract."

It has a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. Cefpiramide works by inhibiting bacterial cell wall biosynthesis. The plasma half-lives of cefpiramide in rabbits, dogs, and rhesus monkeys were much longer than those of cefoperazone and cefazolin.The bactericidal activity of cefpiramide results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs)."
238,"Indicated for the symptomatic treatment of severe nausea and vomiting.[label]    Indicated for the management of manifestations of psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia and generalized non-psychotic anxiety. The use of prochlorperazine for the management of generalized non-psychotic anxiety is typically not a first-line therapy and should be limited to doses of less than 20 mg per day or for shorter than 12 weeks.[label,L6634]    Off-label uses include use in emergency settings for adult and pediatric migraines. The American Headache Society recommends the use of prochlorperazine as the first-line medication in this setting. [L6637]Prochlorperazine, also known as compazine, is a piperazine phenothiazine and first-generation antipsychotic drug that is used for the treatment of severe nausea and vomiting, as well as short-term management of psychotic disorders such as generalized non-psychotic anxiety and schizophrenia.[label] It mainly works by depressing the chemoreceptor trigger zone and blocking D2 dopamine receptors in the brain. It was shown to also block histaminergic, cholinergic and noradrenergic receptors.[L6637] Prochlorperazine was first developed in the 1950s [L6643] and was first approved by the FDA in 1956. Although newer antiemetic agents such as 5-HT3 antagonists are more heavily promoted, prochlorperazine is still widely used in nausea and vomiting.[L6640]Prochlorperazine is an antipsychotic agent that works to promote postsynaptic inhibition of dopaminergic neurons.[L6640] It also exerts its anti-emetic actions via anti-dopaminergic effects, where it displays similar efficacy as ondansteron, a 5HT-3 receptor antagonist and anti-emetic, in preventing delayed nausea and vomiting.[A179179] Prochlorperazine was shown to inhibit histaminergic, cholinergic and alpha-1 adrenergic receptors.[A179173,L6637] The blockade of alpha-1 adrenergic receptors may result in sedation, muscle relaxation, and hypotension. It displays anti-anxiety effects as well.[L6640] Compared to other phenothiazine derivatives, prochlorperazine is less sedating and has a weak propensity for causing hypotension or potentiating the effects of CNS depressants and anesthetics.[L6646] Other than its primary action on D2 receptors, one study showed that prochlorperazine may inhibit the P2X7 receptor in human macrophages, leading to inhibition of calcium ion influx.[L6637]The mechanism of action of prochlorperazine has not been fully determined, but may be primarily related to its anti-dopaminergic effects. Prochlorperazine blocks the D2 dopamine receptors in the brain, which are somatodendritic autoreceptors. Inhibition of D2 receptor signaling results in the blockade of postsynaptic dopamine receptors in the mesolimbic system [L6643] and an increased dopamine turnover. Nausea and vomiting are proposed to arise from peripheral or central stimulation of  serotonin type 3 (5-HT3) and dopamine type 2 receptors, the predominant receptors expressed at the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ).[A179194,L6643] Prochlorperazine exerts antiemetic effects and was shown to inhibit apomorphine-induced vomiting by blocking D2 dopamine receptors in the CTZ.[A179179]. "
239,"For the treatment of term and near-term (&gt;34 weeks) neonates with hypoxic respiratory failureNitric oxide or Nitrogen monoxide is a chemical compound with chemical formula NO. This gas is an important signaling molecule in the body of mammals including humans and is an extremely important intermediate in the chemical industry. It is also a toxic air pollutant produced by automobile engines and power plants.    Nitric oxide (NO) should not be confused with nitrous oxide (N2O), a general anaesthetic, or with nitrogen dioxide (NO2) which is another poisonous air pollutant.    The nitric oxide molecule is a free radical, which is relevant to understanding its high reactivity. It reacts with the ozone in air to form nitrogen dioxide, signalled by the appearance of the reddish-brown color.Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) occurs as a primary developmental defect or as a condition secondary to other diseases such as meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS), pneumonia, sepsis, hyaline membrane disease, congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), and pulmonary hypoplasia. In these states, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is high, which results in hypoxemia secondary to right-to-left shunting of blood through the patent ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale. In neonates with PPHN, Nitric oxide improves oxygenation (as indicated by significant increases in PaO2). Nitric oxide appears to increase the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) by dilating pulmonary vessels in better entilated areas of the lung, redistributing pulmonary blood flow away from lung regions with low ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) ratios toward regions with normal ratios.Nitric oxide is a compound produced by many cells of the body. It relaxes vascular smooth muscle by binding to the heme moiety of cytosolic guanylate cyclase, activating guanylate cyclase and increasing intracellular levels of cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate, which then leads to vasodilation. When inhaled, nitric oxide produces pulmonary vasodilation."
240,"For the treatment of high blood pressure and management of edema related to heart failure.A thiazide diuretic with actions and uses similar to those of hydrochlorothiazide. It has been used in the treatment of familial hyperkalemia, hypertension, edema, and urinary tract disorders. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p810)Bendroflumethiazide, a thiazide diuretic, removes excess water from the body by increasing how often you urinate (pass water) and also widens the blood vessels which helps to reduce blood pressure. It inhibits Na+/Cl- reabsorption from the distal convoluted tubules in the kidneys. Thiazides also cause loss of potassium and an increase in serum uric acid. Thiazides are often used to treat hypertension, but their hypotensive effects are not necessarily due to their diuretic activity. Thiazides have been shown to prevent hypertension-related morbidity and mortality although the mechanism is not fully understood. Thiazides cause vasodilation by activating calcium-activated potassium channels (large conductance) in vascular smooth muscles and inhibiting various carbonic anhydrases in vascular tissue.As a diuretic, bendroflumethiazide inhibits active chloride reabsorption at the early distal tubule via the Na-Cl cotransporter, resulting in an increase in the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water. Thiazides like bendroflumethiazide also inhibit sodium ion transport across the renal tubular epithelium through binding to the thiazide sensitive sodium-chloride transporter. This results in an increase in potassium excretion via the sodium-potassium exchange mechanism. The antihypertensive mechanism of bendroflumethiazide is less well understood although it may be mediated through its action on carbonic anhydrases in the smooth muscle or through its action on the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (KCa) channel, also found in the smooth muscle."
241,"Allopurinol is indicated in [FDA label]:    1) the management of patients with signs and symptoms of primary or secondary gout (acute attacks, tophi, joint destruction, uric acid lithiasis, and/or nephropathy).    2) the management of patients with leukemia, lymphoma and malignancies who are receiving cancer therapy which causes elevations of serum and urinary uric acid levels. Treatment with allopurinol should be discontinued when the potential for overproduction of uric acid is no longer present.    3) the management of patients with recurrent calcium oxalate calculi whose daily uric acid excretion exceeds 800 mg/day in male patients and 750 mg/day in female patients. Therapy in such patients should be carefully assessed initially and reassessed periodically to determine in each case that treatment is beneficial and that the benefits outweigh the risks.Gout is a disease that occurs by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals (MSU) in body tissues, especially around joints [A175942].  This disease has been well-documented in historical medical records and appears in the biographies of several prominent, historically recognized individuals [A175942].    Allopurinol is a xanthine oxidase enzyme inhibitor that is considered to be one of the most effective drugs used to decrease urate levels and is frequently used in the treatment of chronic gout [A36705]. It was initially approved by the FDA in 1966 [L5674] and is now formulated by several manufacturers [L5677].  Allopurinol decreases the production of uric acid by stopping the biochemical reactions that precede its formation [FDA label].  This process decreases urate and relieves the symptoms of gout, which may include painful tophi, joint pain, inflammation, redness, decreased range of motion, and swelling [A665].    Allopurinol is a structural analog of the natural purine base, hypoxanthine.  After ingestion, allopurinol is metabolized to its active metabolite, oxypurinol (_alloxanthine_) in the liver [T508], which acts as an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase enzyme [FDA label].     Allopurinol and its active metabolite inhibit xanthine oxidase, the enzyme that converts hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid. Inhibition of this enzyme is responsible for the effects of allopurinol. This drug increases the reutilization of hypoxanthine and xanthine for nucleotide and nucleic acid synthesis by a process that involves the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRTase).  This process results in an increased nucleotide concentration, which causes feedback inhibition of de novo purine synthesis. The end result is decreased urine and serum uric acid concentrations [F3988], which decreases the incidence of gout symptoms.     Accompanying the reduction of serum uric acid by allopurinol is an increase in the serum and urine concentrations of hypoxanthine and xanthine (due to inhibition of xanthine oxidase).  In the absence of allopurinol, regular urinary excretion of oxypurines almost entirely occurs in the form of uric acid. After the ingestion of allopurinol, the contents of excreted urine are hypoxanthine, xanthine, and uric acid. Because each substance has its own individual solubility, the concentration of uric acid in plasma is decreased without exposing the renal tissues to a high load of uric acid, thereby decreasing the risk of crystalluria. By lowering the uric acid concentration in the plasma below its limits of solubility, allopurinol encourages the dissolution of gout tophi. Although the levels of hypoxanthine and xanthine are found to be increased after allopurinol ingestion, the risk of deposition in renal tissues is less than that of uric acid, as they become more soluble and are rapidly excreted by the kidney [F3988].

242,"Ceftazidime is indicated for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections, skin and skin structure infections, urinary tract infections, bacterial septicemia, bone and joint infections, gynecologic infections, intra-abdominal infections (including peritonitis), and central nervous system infections (including meningitis) caused by susceptible bacteria.[L32935]    Ceftazidime is indicated in combination with [avibactam] to treat infections caused by susceptible Gram-negative organisms, including complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI), in conjunction with [metronidazole], and complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI), including pyelonephritis, in patients aged three months and older. This combination is also indicated to treat hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP) in patients aged 18 years and older.[L45128]    In all cases, to mitigate the risk of bacterial resistance and preserve clinical efficacy, ceftazidime should only be used for infections that are confirmed or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacterial strains.[L32935, L45128]Bacteria possess a cell wall comprising a glycopeptide polymer commonly known as peptidoglycan, which is synthesized and remodelled through the action of a family of enzymes known as ""penicillin-binding proteins"" (PBPs).[A232920] β-lactam antibiotics, including cephalosporins, are PBP inhibitors that, through inhibition of essential PBPs, result in impaired cell wall homeostasis, loss of cell integrity, and ultimately bacterial cell death.[A232920, A232925, A232930] Ceftazidime is a third-generation cephalosporin with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, including against some treatment-resistant bacteria such as _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_.[L32935]    Ceftazidime was approved by the FDA on July 19, 1985, and is currently available either alone or in combination with the non-β-lactam β-lactamase inhibitor [avibactam] to treat a variety of bacterial infections.[L32935, L32940]Ceftazidime is a semisynthetic, broad-spectrum, third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic that is bactericidal through inhibition of enzymes responsible for cell-wall synthesis, primarily penicillin-binding protein 3 (PBP3).[L32935] Among cephalosporins, ceftazidime is notable for its resistance to numerous β-lactamases and its broad spectrum of activity against Gram-negative bacteria, including _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_.[A232935] However, it is less active than first- and second-generation cephalosporins against _Staphylococcus aureus_ and other Gram-positive bacteria and also has low activity against anaerobes.[A232935, A233160] Ceftazidime has confirmed activity against clinically relevant Gram-negative bacteria including _Citrobacter_ spp., _Enterobacter_ spp., _Klebsiella_ spp., _Proteus_ spp., _Serratia spp., _Escherichia coli_, _Haemophilus influenzae_, _Neisseria meningitidis_, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, and some Gram-positive bacteria including _Staphylococcus_ spp. and _Streptococcus_ spp. There are also _in vitro_ data for ceftazidime efficacy against a wide variety of other bacteria, such as _Acinetobacter baumannii_ and _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_, but no clear clinical studies to support the use of ceftazidime for infections caused by these bacteria.[L32935]    Although β-lactam antibiotics like ceftazidime are generally well tolerated, there remains a risk of serious acute hypersensitivity reactions, which is higher in patients with a known allergy to ceftazidime or any other β-lactam antibiotic. As with all antibiotics, ceftazidime may result in the overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms and potentially serious effects including _Clostridium difficile_-associated diarrhea (CDAD); CDAD should be considered in patients who develop diarrhea and, in confirmed cases, supportive care initiated immediately. Ceftazidime is primarily renally excreted such that high and prolonged serum concentrations can occur in patients with renal insufficiency, leading to seizures, nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), encephalopathy, coma, asterixis, neuromuscular excitability, and myoclonia. Treatment may lead to the development or induction of resistance with a risk of treatment failure. Periodic susceptibility testing should be considered, and monotherapy failure may necessitate the addition of another antibiotic such as an aminoglycoside. Cephalosporin use may decrease prothrombin activity, which may be improved by exogenous vitamin K. Inadvertent intra-arterial administration of ceftazidime may result in distal necrosis.[L32935]The bacterial cell wall, which is located at the periphery of Gram-positive bacteria and within the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria, comprises a glycopeptide polymer synthesized through cross-linking of glycans to peptide stems on alternating saccharides, which is known commonly as peptidoglycan.[A232920] Cell wall formation, recycling, and remodelling require numerous enzymes, including a family of enzymes with similar active site character despite distinct and sometimes overlapping roles as carboxypeptidases, endopeptidases, transpeptidases, and transglycosylases, known as ""penicillin-binding proteins"" (PBPs). The number of PBPs differs between bacteria, in which some are considered essential and others redundant. In general, inhibition of one or more essential PBPs results in impaired cell wall homeostasis, loss of cell integrity, and is ultimately bactericidal.[A232920, A232925, A232930]    Ceftazidime is a semisynthetic third-generation cephalosporin with broad activity against numerous Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria.[L32935] Like other β-lactam antibiotics, ceftazidime exhibits its bactericidal effect primarily through direct inhibition of specific PBPs in susceptible bacteria.[A232935] _In vitro_ experiments in Gram-negative bacteria such as _Escherichia coli_, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, _Acinetobacter baumannii_, and _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ suggest that ceftazidime primarily binds to PBP3, with weaker binding to PBP1a/1b and PBP2 as well; although binding to other PBPs, such as PBP4, is detectable, the concentrations required are much greater than those achieved clinically.[A232935, A16721, A232940, A232945, A232950] Similarly, ceftazidime showed binding to _Staphylococcus aureus_ PBP 1, 2, and 3 with a much lower affinity for PBP4.[A16721] Recent data for _Mycobacterium abcessus_ suggest that ceftazidime can inhibit PonA1, PonA2, and PbpA at intermediate concentrations.[A232930]"
243,"As a monotherapy, trimethoprim is indicated for the treatment of acute episodes of uncomplicated urinary tract infections caused by susceptible bacteria, including _E. coli._, _K. pneumoniae_, _Enterobacter spp._, _P. mirabilis_, and coagulase-negative _Staphylococcus_ species.[L11893,L11890] In various formulations in combination with [sulfamethoxazole], trimethoprim is indicated for the following infections caused by bacteria with documented susceptibility: urinary tract infections, acute otitis media in pediatric patients (when clinically indicated), acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis in adults, enteritis caused by susceptible _Shigella_, prophylaxis and treatment of _Pneumocystis jiroveci_ pneumonia, and travelers' diarrhea caused by enterotoxigenic _E. coli_.[L11830,L11863]    Trimethoprim is available as an ophthalmic solution in combination with [polymyxin B] for the treatment of acute bacterial conjunctivitis, blepharitis, and blepharoconjunctivitis caused by susceptible bacteria.[L11887]Trimethoprim is an antifolate antibacterial agent that inhibits bacterial dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), a critical enzyme that catalyzes the formation of tetrahydrofolic acid (THF) - in doing so, it prevents the synthesis of bacterial DNA and ultimately continued bacterial survival.[L11893] Trimethoprim is often used in combination with [sulfamethoxazole] due to their complementary and synergistic mechanisms but may be used as a monotherapy in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of urinary tract infections.[L11893,L11830] It is structurally and chemically related to [pyrimethamine], another antifolate antimicrobial used in the treatment of plasmodial infections.[T707]Trimethoprim exerts its antimicrobial effects by inhibiting an essential step in the synthesis of bacterial nucleic acids and proteins.[L11893] It has shown activity against several species of gram-negative bacteria, as well as coagulase-negative _Staphylococcus_ species. [L11893] Resistance to trimethoprim may arise via a variety of mechanisms, including alterations to the bacterial cell wall, overproduction of dihydrofolate reductase, or production of resistant dihydrofolate reductase.[L11893] Rarely, trimethoprim can precipitate the development of blood disorders (e.g. thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, etc.) which may be preceded by symptoms such as sore throat, fever, pallor, and or purpura - patients should be monitored closely for the development of these symptoms throught the course of therapy.[L11893]    As antimicrobial susceptibility patterns are geographically distinct, local antibiograms should be consulted to ensure adequate coverage of relevant pathogens prior to use.Trimethoprim is a reversible inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase, one of the principal enzymes catalyzing the formation of tetrahydrofolic acid (THF) from dihydrofolic acid (DHF).[L11893] Tetrahydrofolic acid is necessary for the biosynthesis of bacterial nucleic acids and proteins and ultimately for continued bacterial survival - inhibiting its synthesis, then, results in bactericidal activity. Trimethoprim binds with a much stronger affinity to bacterial dihydrofolate reductase as compared to its mammalian counterpart, allowing trimethoprim to selectively interfere with bacterial biosynthetic processes.[L11893]     Trimethoprim is often given in combination with sulfamethoxazole, which inhibits the preceding step in bacterial protein synthesis - given together, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim inhibit two consecutive steps in the biosynthesis of bacterial nucleic acids and proteins.[L11830]  As a monotherapy trimethoprim is considered bacteriostatic, but in combination with sulfamethoxazole is thought to exert bactericidal activity.[L11887,A191089]"
244,"[L32950]    Gemcitabine in combination with [paclitaxel] is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer after failure of prior anthracycline-containing adjuvant chemotherapy, unless anthracyclines were clinically contraindicated.[L32950]    In combination with [cisplatin], gemcitabine is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with inoperable, locally advanced (Stage IIIA or IIIB) or metastatic (Stage IV) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).[L32950] Dual therapy with cisplatin is also used to treat patients with Stage IV (locally advanced or metastatic) transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder.[L32955]    Gemcitabine is indicated as first-line treatment for patients with locally advanced (nonresectable Stage II or Stage III) or metastatic (Stage IV) adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Gemcitabine is indicated for patients previously treated with [fluorouracil].[L32950]Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analog and a chemotherapeutic agent. It was originally investigated for its antiviral effects, but it is now used as an anticancer therapy for various cancers.[A233135] Gemcitabine is a cytidine analog with two fluorine atoms replacing the hydroxyl on the ribose.[A233145] As a prodrug, gemcitabine is transformed into its active metabolites that work by replacing the building blocks of nucleic acids during DNA elongation, arresting tumour growth and promoting apoptosis of malignant cells.[L32960] The structure, metabolism, and mechanism of action of gemcitabine are similar to [cytarabine], but gemcitabine has a wider spectrum of antitumour activity.[A233140]    Gemcitabine is marketed as Gemzar and it is available as intravenous injection. [L32950] It is also being investigated in other cancer and tumour types.Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analog that mediates its antitumour effects by promoting apoptosis of malignant cells undergoing DNA synthesis. More specifically, it blocks the progression of cells through the G1/S-phase boundary.[L32950] Gemcitabine demonstrated cytotoxic effects against a broad range of cancer cell lines _in vitro_. It displayed schedule-dependent antitumour activity in various animal models and xenografts from human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pancreatic cancer.[A233140] Therefore, the antineoplastic effects of gemcitabine are enhanced through prolonged infusion time rather than higher dosage.[A233140] Gemcitabine inhibited the growth of human xenografts from carcinoma of the lung, pancreas, ovaries, head and neck, and breast. In mice, gemcitabine inhibited the growth of human tumour xenografts from the breast, colon, lung or pancreas by 69 to 99%. In clinical trials of advanced NSCLC, gemcitabine monotherapy produced objective response rates ranging from 18 to 26%, with a median duration of response ranging from 3.3 to 12.7 months. Overall median survival time was 6.2 to 12.3 months. In patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, objective response rates in patients ranged from 5.to 12%, with a median survival duration of 3.9 to 6.3 months.[A233145] In Phase II trials involving patients with metastatic breast cancer, treatment with gemcitabine alone or with adjuvant chemotherapies resulted in response rate ranging from 13 to 42% and median survival duration ranging from 11.5 to 17.8 months. In metastatic bladder cancer, gemcitabine has a response rate 20 to 28%. In Phase II trials of advanced ovarian cancer, patients treated with gemcitabine had response rate of 57.1%, with progression free survival of 13.4 months and median survival of 24 months.[A233140]    Gemcitabine causes dose-limiting myelosuppression, such as anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia; however, events leading to discontinuation tend to occur less than 1% of the patients. Gemcitabine can elevate ALT, AST and alkaline phosphatase levels.[A233145]Gemcitabine is a potent and specific deoxycytidine analog. After uptake into malignant cells, gemcitabine is phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase to form gemcitabine monophosphate, which is then converted to the active compounds, gemcitabine diphosphate (dFdCDP) and gemcitabine triphosphate (dFdCTP). These active metabolites are nucleosides that mediate antitumour effects. dFdCTP competes with deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) for incorporation into DNA, thereby competitively inhibiting DNA chain elongation. The non-terminal position of dFdCTP in the DNA chain prevents detection of dFdCTP in the chain and repair by proof-reading 3�?�?exonuclease: this process is referred to as ""masked DNA chain termination."" Incorporation of dFdCTP into the DNA chain ultimately leads to chain termination, DNA fragmentation, and apoptotic cell death of malignant cells.[A233140,A233145,L32950]    Gemcitabine has self-potentiating pharmacological actions that can increase the probability of successful incorporation of gemcitabine triphosphate into the DNA chain: dFdCDP inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, an enzyme responsible for catalyzing the reactions that generate dCTP for DNA synthesis. Since dFdCDP reduces the levels of dCTP, there is less competition for gemcitabine triphosphate for incorporation into DNA.[A233140,L32950] Gemcitabine can also reduce metabolism and elimination of active metabolites from the target ce1l, prolonging high intracellular concentrations of the active metabolites. Such self-potentiating effects are not present with [cytarabine].[A233140]"
245,"As a member of the corticosteroid family, betamethasone is indicated for the treatment of several inflammatory conditions. As topical monotherapy, betamethasone is indicated to relieve pruritic and inflammatory symptoms of corticosteroid-responsive-dermatoses.L12000] The corticosteroid is also available as an injectable suspension and can be used to manage a range of inflammatory conditions including endocrine disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, and rheumatic disorders among other conditions.[L11994]  Betamethasone is a long-acting corticosteroid with immunosuppressive and antiinflammatory properties.[A192444] It can be used topically to manage inflammatory skin conditions such as eczema, and parenterally to manage several disease states including autoimmune disorders.[A192444] Betamethasone has potent glucocorticoid activity and negligible mineralocorticoid activity.[A192444]Corticosteroids bind to the glucocorticoid receptor inhibiting pro-inflammatory signals, while promoting anti-inflammatory signals.[A187463] Corticosteroids have a wide therapeutic window as patients may require doses that are multiples of what the body naturally produces.[A187463] Patients who require long-term treatment with a corticosteroid should be counselled regarding the risk of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression and increased susceptibility to infections.[A187463]Glucocorticoids inhibit neutrophil apoptosis and demargination, and inhibit NF-Kappa B and other inflammatory transcription factors.[A187463] They also inhibit phospholipase A2, leading to decreased formation of arachidonic acid derivatives.[A187463] In addition, glucocorticoids promote anti-inflammatory genes like interleukin-10.[A187463]    Corticosteroids like betamethasone can act through nongenomic and genomic pathways.[A31458] The genomic pathway is slower and occurs when glucocorticoids activate glucocorticoid receptors and initiate downstream effects that promote transcription of anti-inflammatory genes including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), IL-1-receptor antagonist, and tyrosine amino transferase (TAT).[A31458] On the other hand, the nongenomic pathway is able to elicit a quicker response by modulating T-cell, platelet and monocyte activity through the use of existing membrane-bound receptors and second messengers.[A31458]"
246,"Teniposide is used for the treatment of refractory acute lymphoblastic leukaemiaTeniposide is a semisynthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin that exhibits antitumor activity. Teniposide inhibits DNA synthesis by forming a complex with topoisomerase II and DNA. This complex induces breaks in double stranded DNA and prevents repair by topoisomerase II binding. Accumulated breaks in DNA prevent cells from entering into the mitotic phase of the cell cycle, and lead to cell death. Teniposide acts primarily in the G2 and S phases of the cycle.Teniposide is a phase-specific cytotoxic drug, acting in the late S or early G 2 phase of the cell cycle. Teniposide prevents cell mitosis by causing single and double stranded DNA breaks as well as cross linking between protein and DNA.The mechanism of action appears to be related to the inhibition of type II topoisomerase activity since teniposide does not intercalate into DNA or bind strongly to DNA. Teniposide binds to and inhibits DNA topoisomerase II. The cytotoxic effects of teniposide are related to the relative number of double-stranded DNA breaks produced in cells, which are a reflection of the stabilization of a topoisomerase II-DNA intermediate."
247,"Used in treatment of cholera, as it destroys the vibrios and decreases the diarrhea. It is effective against tetracycline-resistant vibrios. It is also used in eye drops or ointment to treat bacterial conjunctivitis.An antibiotic first isolated from cultures of _Streptomyces venezuelae_ in 1947 but now produced synthetically. It has a relatively simple structure and was the first broad-spectrum antibiotic to be discovered. It acts by interfering with bacterial protein synthesis and is mainly bacteriostatic. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 29th ed, p106)    The FDA has withdrawn all oral drug products containing chloramphenicol, due to the high risk of fatal aplastic anemia associated with this specific route of administration.[L43942,L44022]Chloramphenicol is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that was derived from the bacterium Streptomyces venezuelae and is now produced synthetically. Chloramphenicol is effective against a wide variety of microorganisms, but due to serious side-effects (e.g., damage to the bone marrow, including aplastic anemia) in humans, it is usually reserved for the treatment of serious and life-threatening infections (e.g., typhoid fever). Chloramphenicol is bacteriostatic but may be bactericidal in high concentrations or when used against highly susceptible organisms. Chloramphenicol stops bacterial growth by binding to the bacterial ribosome (blocking peptidyl transferase) and inhibiting protein synthesis.Chloramphenicol is lipid-soluble, allowing it to diffuse through the bacterial cell membrane. It then reversibly binds to the L16 protein of the 50S subunit of bacterial ribosomes, where transfer of amino acids to growing peptide chains is prevented (perhaps by suppression of peptidyl transferase activity), thus inhibiting peptide bond formation and subsequent protein synthesis."
248,"Used to treat upper respiratory tract bacterial infections, chronic bronchitis, pneumonia, sinusitis, pharyntitis and tonsillitis, skin absceses, urinary tract infections and pyelonephritis caused by E. coli, S. pyogenes, S. aureus,S. saprphyticus, S. penumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis.Loracarbef is a carbacephem antibiotic sometimes grouped together with the second-generation cephalosporin antibiotics. It is marketed under the trade name Lorabid.Loracarbef is considered a second generation cephalosporin antibiotic. The advantages of cephalosporin antibiotics include a broad range of activity, a safe record in children with almost no dose-related toxicity, and the lack of need to monitor levels. Adverse reactions are rare and consist primarily of hypersensitivity reactions with urticaria, nonspecific rash, and pruritus. Loracarbef can be used to treat a large number of bacterial infections caused by gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including upper respiratory tract bacterial infections, chronic bronchitis, pneumonia, sinusitis, pharyntitis and tonsillitis, skin absceses, urinary tract infections and pyelonephritis caused by E. coli, S. pyogenes, S. aureus,S. saprphyticus, S. penumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis.Loracarbef is an oral, synthetic beta-lactam antibiotic of the carbacephem class. Chemically, carbacephems differ from cephalosporin-class antibiotics in the dihydrothiazine ring where a methylene group has been substituted for a sulfur atom. Loracarbef has a spectrum of activity similar to that of the second generation cephalosporins. It is structurally identical to cefaclor except for a sulfur atom that has been replaced by a methylene group. This change gives greater chemical stability in solution and allows storage at room temperature. Loracarbef, like all b-lactams and cephalosporins, inhibits penicillin binding proteins, enzymes that create the cross-linkage of the peptidoglycan polymer. This binding leads to interference with the formation and remodeling of the cell wall structure."
249,"Lansoprazole is used to reduce gastric acid secretion and is approved for short term treatment of active gastric ulcers, active duodenal ulcers, erosive reflux oesophagitis, symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) induced gastric and duodenal ulcers. [A4892][A177065][FDA Label]  It may be used in the maintenance and healing of several gastric conditions including duodenal ulcers, NSAID related gastric ulcers, and erosive esophagitis.[FDA Label] Lansoprazole prevents recurrence of gastric ulcers in patients who have a documented history of gastric ulcers who also use NSAIDs chronically. [FDA Label]  Predictably, it is also useful in the management of hypersecretory conditions including Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. [FDA Label]  Lansoprazole is effective at eradicating H. pylori when used in conjunction with amoxicillin and clarithromycin (triple therapy) or with amoxicillin alone (dual therapy). [FDA Label]Lansoprazole marketed under the brand Prevacid, is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and is structurally classified as a substituted benzimidazole.[A177065] It reduces gastric acid secretion by targeting gastric H,K-ATPase pumps and is thus effective at promoting healing in ulcerative diseases, and treating gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) along with other pathologies caused by excessive acid secretion.[A177053]Lansoprazole decreases gastric acid secretion by targeting H+,K+-ATPase, which is the enzyme that catalyzes the final step in the acid secretion pathway in parietal cells. [A177080]  Conveniently, lansoprazole administered any time of day is able to inhibit both daytime and nocturnal acid secretion.[A177080]  The result is that lansoprazole is effective at healing duodenal ulcers, reduces ulcer-related pain, and offers relief from symptoms of heartburn [A177080]  Lansoprazole also reduces pepsin secretion, making it a useful treatment option for hypersecretory conditions such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.[A177089][A177080]As a PPI, lansoprazole is a prodrug and requires protonation via an acidic environment to become activated. [A174244]  Once protonated, lansoprazole is able to react with cysteine residues, specifically Cys813 and Cys321, on parietal H+,K+-ATPase resulting in stable disulfides.[A174244][A177077]  PPI's in general are able to provide prolonged inhibition of acid secretion due to their ability to bind covalently to their targets.[A174244]   "
250,"Dipivefrin is a prodrug which is used as initial therapy for the control of intraocular pressure in chronic open-angle glaucoma.Dipivefrin is a prodrug of adrenaline, which is used to treat glaucoma. It is available as ophthalmic solution (eye drops).Dipivefrin is a member of a class of drugs known as prodrugs. Prodrugs are usually not active in themselves and require biotransformation to the parent compound before therapeutic activity is seen. These modifications are undertaken to enhance absorption, decrease side effects and enhance stability and comfort, thus making the parent compound a more useful drug. Enhanced absorption makes the prodrug a more efficient delivery system for the parent drug because less drug will be needed to produce the desired therapeutic response. Dipivefrin is a prodrug of epinephrine formed by the diesterification of epinephrine and pivalic acid. The addition of pivaloyl groups to the epinephrine molecule enhances its lipophilic character and, as a consequence, its penetration into the anterior chamber.Dipivefrin is a prodrug with little or no pharmacologically activity until it is hydrolyzed into epinephrine inside the human eye. The liberated epinephrine, an adrenergic agonist, appears to exert its action by stimulating α -and/or β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors, leading to a decrease in aqueous production and an enhancement of outflow facility. The dipivefrin prodrug delivery system is a more efficient way of delivering the therapeutic effects of epinephrine, with fewer side effects than are associated with conventional epinephrine therapy."
251,"Droperidol is used to produce tranquilization and to reduce the incidence of nausea and vomiting in surgical and diagnostic procedures.A butyrophenone with general properties similar to those of haloperidol. It is used in conjunction with an opioid analgesic such as fentanyl to maintain the patient in a calm state of neuroleptanalgesia with indifference to surroundings but still able to cooperate with the surgeon. It is also used as a premedicant, as an antiemetic, and for the control of agitation in acute psychoses. (From Martindale, The Extra  Pharmacopoeia, 29th ed, p593)Droperidol produces marked tranquilization and sedation. It allays apprehension and provides a state of mental detachment and indifference while maintaining a state of reflex alertness. Droperidol produces an antiemetic effect as evidenced by the antagonism of apomorphine in dogs. It lowers the incidence of nausea and vomiting during surgical procedures and provides antiemetic protection in the postoperative period. Droperidol potentiates other CNS depressants. It produces mild alpha-adrenergic blockade, peripheral vascular dilatation and reduction of the pressor effect of epinephrine. It can produce hypotension and decreased peripheral vascular resistance and may decrease pulmonary arterial pressure (particularly if it is abnormally high). It may reduce the incidence of epinephrine-induced arrhythmias, but it does not prevent other cardiac arrhythmias.The exact mechanism of action is unknown, however, droperidol causes a CNS depression at subcortical levels of the brain, midbrain, and brainstem reticular formation. It may antagonize the actions of glutamic acid within the extrapyramidal system. It may also inhibit cathecolamine receptors and the reuptake of neurotransmiters and has strong central antidopaminergic action and weak central anticholinergic action. It can also produce ganglionic blockade and reduced affective response. The main actions seem to stem from its potent Dopamine(2) receptor antagonism with minor antagonistic effects on alpha-1 adrenergic receptors as well."
252,"For the ophthalmic treatment of corticosteroid-responsive inflammation of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea and anterior segment of the globe.A glucocorticoid employed, usually as eye drops, in the treatment of allergic and inflammatory conditions of the eye. It has also been used topically in the treatment of various skin disorders. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p732)Corticosteroids such as fluorometholone inhibit the inflammatory response to a variety of inciting agents and probably delay or slow healing. They inhibit the edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation associated with inflammation.There is no generally accepted explanation for the mechanism of action of ocular corticosteroids. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2. Their primary target is the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor. After binding the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific target genes.It is also indicated as an adjunct to surgery and radioiodine therapy in the management of thyrotropin-dependent well-differentiated thyroid cancer.Levothyroxine is a synthetically produced form of thyroxine, a major endogenous hormone secreted by the thyroid gland.[F4633] Also known as L-thyroxine or the brand name product Synthroid, levothyroxine is used primarily to treat hypothyroidism, a condition where the thyroid gland is no longer able to produce sufficient quantities of the thyroid hormones T4 (tetraiodothyronine or thyroxine) and T3 (triiodothyronine or [DB00279]), resulting in diminished down-stream effects of these hormones. Without sufficient quantities of circulating thyroid hormones, symptoms of hypothyroidism begin to develop such as fatigue, increased heart rate, depression[A179620], dry skin and hair, muscle cramps, constipation, weight gain, memory impairment, and poor tolerance to cold temperatures.[F4636,A35722]    In response to Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) release by the pituitary gland, a normally functioning thyroid gland will produce and secrete T4, which is then converted through deiodination (by type I or type II 5�?deiodinases)[A179941] into its active metabolite . While T4 is the major product secreted by the thyroid gland,  T3 exerts the majority of the physiological effects of the thyroid hormones; T4and T3 have a relative potency of ~1:4 (T4:T3).[F4633] T4 and T3 act on nearly every cell of the body, but have a particularly strong effect on the cardiac system.[A179935] As a result, many cardiac functions including heart rate, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance are closely linked to thyroid status.[A179938]    Prior to the development of levothyroxine, [DB09100] or desiccated thyroid, used to be the mainstay of treatment for hypothyroidism. However, this is no longer recommended for the majority of patients due to several clinical concerns including limited controlled trials supporting its use. Desiccated thyroid products contain a ratio of T4 to T3 of 4.2:1, which is significantly lower than the 14:1 ratio of secretion by the human thyroid gland. This higher proportion of T3 in desiccated thyroid products can lead to supraphysiologic levels of T3 which may put patients at risk of thyrotoxicosis if thyroid extract therapy is not adjusted according to the serum TSH.[A35722, F4636]Oral levothyroxine is a synthetic hormone that exerts the same physiologic effect as endogenous T4, thereby maintaining normal T4 levels when a deficiency is present.     Levothyroxine has a narrow therapeutic index and is titrated to maintain a euthyroid state with TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) within a therapeutic range of 0.4�?.0 mIU/L.[A35722] Over- or under-treatment with levothyroxine may have negative effects on growth and development, cardiovascular function, bone metabolism, reproductive function, cognitive function, emotional state, gastrointestinal function and glucose and lipid metabolism. The dose of levothyroxine should be titrated slowly and carefully and patients should be monitored for their response to titration to avoid these effects. TSH levels should be monitored at least yearly to avoid over-treating with levothyroxine which can result in hyperthyroidism (TSH <0.1mIU/L) and symptoms of increased heart rate, diarrhea, tremor, hypercalcemia, and weakness to name a few.[F4636]    As many cardiac functions including heart rate, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance are closely linked to thyroid status,[A179938] over-treatment with levothyroxine may result in increases in heart rate, cardiac wall thickness, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease and in elderly patients. In populations with any cardiac concerns, levothyroxine should be initiated at lower doses than those recommended in younger individuals or in patients without cardiac disease. Patients receiving concomitant levothyroxine and sympathomimetic agents should be monitored for signs and symptoms of coronary insufficiency. If cardiac symptoms develop or worsen, reduce the levothyroxine dose or withhold for one week and restart at a lower dose.[F4636]    Increased bone resorption and decreased bone mineral density may occur as a result of levothyroxine over-replacement, particularly in post-menopausal women. The increased bone resorption may be associated with increased serum levels and urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorous, elevations in bone alkaline phosphatase and suppressed serum parathyroid hormone levels. Administer the minimum dose of levothyroxine that achieves the desired clinical and biochemical response to mitigate this risk.    Addition of levothyroxine therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing or discontinuing levothyroxine.Levothyroxine is a synthetically prepared levo-isomer of the thyroid hormone thyroxine (T4, a tetra-iodinated tyrosine derivative) that acts as a replacement in deficiency syndromes such as hypothyroidism. T4 is the major hormone secreted from the thyroid gland and is chemically identical to the naturally secreted T4: it increases metabolic rate, decreases thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) production from the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland, and, in peripheral tissues, is converted to T3. Thyroxine is released from its precursor protein thyroglobulin through proteolysis and secreted into the blood where is it then peripherally deiodinated to form triiodothyronine (T3）which exerts a broad spectrum of stimulatory effects on cell metabolism. T4 and T3 have a relative potency of ~1:4.     Thyroid hormone increases the metabolic rate of cells of all tissues in the body. In the fetus and newborn, thyroid hormone is important for the growth and development of all tissues including bones and the brain. In adults, thyroid hormone helps to maintain brain function, food metabolism, and body temperature, among other effects. The symptoms of thyroid deficiency relieved by levothyroxine include slow speech, lack of energy, weight gain, hair loss, dry thick skin and unusual sensitivity to cold.    The thyroid hormones have been shown to exert both genomic and non-genomic effects.[A179950] They exert their genomic effects by diffusing into the cell nucleus and binding to thyroid hormone receptors in DNA regions called thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) near genes.[A179605] This complex of T4, T3, DNA, and other coregulatory proteins causes a conformational change and a resulting shift in transcriptional regulation of nearby genes, synthesis of messenger RNA, and cytoplasmic protein production.[A179605,A179935] For example, in cardiac tissues T<sub>3</sub> has been shown to regulate the genes for α- and β-myosin heavy chains, production of the sarcoplasmic reticulum proteins calcium-activated ATPase (Ca2+-ATPase) and phospholamban, β-adrenergic receptors, guanine-nucleotide regulatory proteins, and adenylyl cyclase types V and VI as well as several plasma-membrane ion transporters, such as Na+/K+–ATPase, Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, and voltage-gated potassium channels, including Kv1.5, Kv4.2, and Kv4.3. [A179938] As a result, many cardiac functions including heart rate, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance are closely linked to thyroid status.    The non-genomic actions of the thyroid hormones have been shown to occur through binding to a plasma membrane receptor integrin aVb3 at the Arg-Gly-Asp recognition site.[A179959] From the cell-surface, T4 binding to integrin results in down-stream effects including activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK; ERK1/2) and causes subsequent effects on cellular/nuclear events including angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation.[A179935, A179956]"
253,"For the treatment of bacterial blepharitis, bacterial bonjunctivitis, corneal injuries, corneal ulcers and meibomianitis. For the prophylaxis of ocular infections following foreign body removalA component of neomycin that is produced by Streptomyces fradiae. On hydrolysis it yields neamine and neobiosamine B. (From Merck Index, 11th ed)Framycetin is used for the treatment of bacterial eye infections such as conjunctivitis. Framycetin is an antibiotic. It is not active against fungi, viruses and most kinds of anaerobic bacteria. Framycetin works by binding to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit, causing misreading of t-RNA, leaving the bacterium unable to synthesize proteins vital to its growth. Framycetin is useful primarily in infections involving aerobic bacteria bacteria.Framycetin binds to specific 30S-subunit proteins and 16S rRNA, four nucleotides of 16S rRNA and a single amino acid of protein S12. This interferes with decoding site in the vicinity of nucleotide 1400 in 16S rRNA of 30S subunit. This region interacts with the wobble base in the anticodon of tRNA. This leads to interference with the initiation complex, misreading of mRNA so incorrect amino acids are inserted into the polypeptide leading to nonfunctional or toxic peptides and the breakup of polysomes into nonfunctional monosomes."
254,"For the treatment and management of Brucellosis, mycoplasma infection, acne vulgaris, chlamydial infection;Chronic bronchitisClomocycline is a tetracycline used to treat bacterial infections.Clomocycline is a tetracycline antibiotic that is commonly prescribed by medical doctors for infections and to treat acne. It may also be used to treat urinary tract infections, gum disease, and other bacterial infections such as gonorrhea and chlamydia. Clomocycline is also used commonly as a prophylactic treatment for infection by Bacillus anthracis (anthrax). It is also effective against Yersinia pestis and malaria and is also prescribed for the treatment of Lyme disease. Clomocycline inhibits cell growth by inhibiting translation. It binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit and prevents the amino-acyl tRNA from binding to the A site of the ribosome. The binding is reversible in nature. Cells become resistant to Clomocycline by at least two mechanisms: efflux and ribosomal protection. In efflux, a resistance gene encodes a membrane protein that actively pumps Clomocycline out of the cell. This is the mechanism of action of the tetracycline resistance gene on the artificial plasmid pBR322. In ribosomal protection, a resistance gene encodes a protein which binds to the ribosome and prevents Clomocycline from acting on the ribosome.Clomocycline inhibits cell growth by inhibiting translation. It binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit and prevents the amino-acyl tRNA from binding to the A site of the ribosome. The binding is reversible in nature. Clomocycline is lipophilic and can easily pass through the cell membrane or passively diffuses through porin channels in the bacterial membrane."
255,"Used to control moderate to severe pain.A narcotic analgesic that can be used for the relief of most types of moderate to severe pain, including postoperative pain and the pain of labor. Prolonged use may lead to dependence of the morphine type; withdrawal symptoms appear more rapidly than with morphine and are of shorter duration.Meperidine is a synthetic opiate agonist belonging to the phenylpiperidine class. Meperidine may produce less smooth muscle spasm, constipation, and depression of the cough reflex than equivalent doses of morphine. The onset of action is lightly more rapid than with morphine, and the duration of action is slightly shorter. The chemical structure of meperidine is similar to local anesthetics. Meperidine is recommended for relief of moderate to severe acute pain and has the unique ability to interrupt postoperative shivering and shaking chills induced by amphotericin B. Meperidine has also been used for intravenous regional anesthesia, peripheral nerve blocks and intraarticular, epidural and spinal analgesia. Meperidine is considered a second-line agent for the treatment of acute pain.Meperidine is primarily a kappa-opiate receptor agonist and also has local anesthetic effects. Meperidine has more affinity for the kappa-receptor than morphine. Opiate receptors are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as both positive and negative regulators of synaptic transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine and noradrenaline is inhibited. Opioids also inhibit the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin and glucagon. Opioids close N-type voltage-operated calcium channels (OP2-receptor agonist) and open calcium-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channels (OP3 and OP1 receptor agonist). This results in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability."
256,"Loratadine is a 2nd generation antihistamine and is used to manage symptoms of allergic rhinitis, wheal formation, urticaria, and other allergic dermatologic conditions.[A176435][A176438][L8486] Loratadine is a second generation antihistamine used to manage symptoms of allergic rhinitis.[A176435] A lack of sedative and CNS adverse effects make loratadine, along with other second generation antihistamines, preferable over their 1st generation counterparts in many clinical situations.[A176441]Like other 2nd generation antihistamines, loratadine is selective for peripheral H1 receptors.[A5506] Loratadine does not penetrate effectively into the central nervous system and has poor affinity for CNS H1-receptors.[A5506] These qualities result in a lack of CNS depressant effects such as drowsiness, sedation, and impaired psychomotor function.[A5506]Histamine release is a key mediator in allergic rhinitis and urticaria.[A185312][A176441][A175060] As a result, loratadine exerts it's effect by targeting H1 histamine receptors.    Loratadine binds to H1 histamine receptors found on the surface of epithelial cells, endothelial cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, airway cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells among others.[A176441] H1 histamine receptors fall under the wider umbrella of G-protein coupled receptors, and exist in a state of equilibrium between the active and inactive forms.[A176441][A175060] Histamine binding to the H1-receptor facilitates cross linking between transmembrane domains III and V, stabilizing the active form of the receptor.[A176441][A175060] On the other hand, antihistamines bind to a different site on the H1 receptor favouring the inactive form.[A176441][A175060]    Hence, loratadine can more accurately be classified as an ""inverse agonist"" as opposed to a ""histamine antagonist"", and can prevent or reduce the severity of histamine mediated symptoms.[A176441][A175060][L8486]    "
257,"Used to prevent infection during surgery and to treat many kinds of infections of the blood, bone or joints, respiratory tract, skin, and urinary tract.Cefalotin is a cephalosporin antibiotic.Cefalotin (INN) or cephalothin (USAN) is a semisynthetic first generation cephalosporin having a broad spectrum of antibiotic activity that is administered parenterally.The bactericidal activity of cefalotin results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). The PBPs are transpeptidases which are vital in peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Therefore, their inhibition prevents this vital cell wall compenent from being properly synthesized."
258,"This drug is indicated for the treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure).Prazosin is a drug used to treat hypertension.  Prazosin is marketed by _Pfizer_ and was initially approved by the FDA in 1988.[L5828]  It belongs to the class of drugs known as alpha-1 antagonists.    Recently, many studies have evaluated the benefits of this drug in controlling the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and associated nightmares.[A176618, A176621, A176624]**Effects on blood pressure**    The pharmacodynamic and therapeutic effect of this drug includes is a decrease in blood pressure as well as clinically significant decreases in cardiac output, heart rate, blood flow to the kidney, and glomerular filtration rate. The decrease in blood pressure may occur in both standing and supine positions [FDA label].     Many of the above effects are due to vasodilation of blood vessels caused by prazosin, resulting in decreased peripheral resistance [A176627], [FDA label].  Peripheral resistance refers to the level resistance of the blood vessels to blood that flows through them. As the blood vessels constrict (narrow), the resistance increases and as they dilate (widen), and peripheral resistance decreases, lowering blood pressure [A176747, L5831].      **Effects on sleep disturbance related to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**    Some studies have suggested that this drug improves sleep in patients suffering from insomnia related to nightmares and post-traumatic stress disorder, caused by hyperarousal [A176621, A176624]. This effect likely occurs through the inhibition of adrenergic stimulation found in states of hyperarousal [A176738].Alpha-adrenergic receptors are essential for the regulation of blood pressure in humans. Two types of alpha receptors, alpha 1 and alpha 2, both play a role in regulating blood pressure.  Alpha-1 receptors are postsynaptic (located after the nerve junction, or space between a nerve fiber and target tissue). In this case, the target tissue is the vascular smooth muscle [L5837].  These receptors, when activated, increase blood pressure [A176648].     Prazosin inhibits the postsynaptic alpha-1 adrenoceptors. This inhibition blocks the vasoconstricting (narrowing) effect of catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) on the vessels, leading to peripheral blood vessel dilation.  Through blood vessel constriction by adrenergic receptor activation, epinephrine and norepinephrine normally act to increase blood pressure [A176654].  "
259,"For the relief of symptoms of depression and as temporary adjunctive therapy in reducing enuresis in children aged 6 years and older [FDA Label].     May also be used off-label to manage panic disorders with or without agoraphobia, as a second line agent for ADHD in children and adolescents, to manage bulimia nervosa, for short-term management of acute depressive episodes in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, for the treatment of acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder, and for symptomatic treatment of postherpetic neuralgia and painful diabetic neuropathy [L1349,L1348,A31900,L1351,L1352,L1353,A31904]. Imipramine, the prototypical tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), is a dibenzazepine-derivative TCA. TCAs are structurally similar to phenothiazines. They contain a tricyclic ring system with an alkyl amine substituent on the central ring. In non-depressed individuals, imipramine does not affect mood or arousal, but may cause sedation. In depressed individuals, imipramine exerts a positive effect on mood. TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Tertiary amine TCAs, such as imipramine and amitriptyline, are more potent inhibitors of serotonin reuptake than secondary amine TCAs, such as nortriptyline and desipramine. TCAs also block histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptors, &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors and muscarinic receptors, which accounts for their sedative, hypotensive and anticholinergic effects (e.g. blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention), respectively [A6584]. Imipramine has less sedative and anticholinergic effects than the tertiary amine TCAs, amitriptyline and clomipramine. Imipramine may be used to treat depression and nocturnal enuresis in children [FDA Label]. Unlabeled indications include chronic and neuropathic pain (including diabetic neuropathy), panic disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [L1349,L1348,A31900,L1351,L1352,L1353,A31904].Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant with general pharmacological properties similar to those of structurally related tricyclic antidepressant drugs such as amitriptyline and doxepin. While it acts to block both, imipramine displays a much higher affinity for the serotonin reuptake transporter than for the norepinephrine reuptake transporter [A6584]. Imipramine produces effects similar to other monoamine targeting antidepressants, increasing serotonin- and norepinephrine-based neurotransmission.    This modulation of neurotransmission produces a complex range of changes in brain structure and function along with an improvement in depressive symptoms. The changes include increases in hippocampal neurogenesis and reduced downregulation of this neurogenesis in response to stress [A31931]. These implicate brain derived neurotrophic factor signalling as a necessary contributor to antidepressant effect although the link to the direct increase in monoamine neurotransmission is unclear.    Serotonin reuptake targeting agents may also produce a down-regulation in β-adrenergic receptors in the brain [A31938].Imipramine works by inhibiting the neuronal reuptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin [A6584,T116]. It binds the sodium-dependent serotonin transporter and sodium-dependent norepinephrine transporter reducing the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin by neurons. Depression has been linked to a lack of stimulation of the post-synaptic neuron by norepinephrine and serotonin [A31933]. Slowing the reuptake of these neurotransmitters increases their concentration in the synaptic cleft, producing knock-on effects in protein kinase signalling which is thought to contribute to changes in neurotransmission and brain physiology which relieves symptoms of depression [A31939].

260,"For the treatment of patients with predominantly classic subfoveal choroidal neovascularization due to age-related macular degeneration, pathologic myopia or presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome. Verteporfin can also be used to destroy tumors.Verteporfin, marketed as Visudyne, is a benzoporphyrin derivative. It is used as a photosensitizer in photodynamic therapy to eliminate abnormal blood vessels in wet form macular degeneration. Verteporfin accumulates in these abnormal blood vessels and, when stimulated by nonthermal red light with a wavelength of 693 nm in the presence of oxygen, produces highly reactive short-lived singlet oxygen and other reactive oxygen radicals, resulting in local damage to the endothelium and blockage of the vessels.Verteporfin, otherwise known as benzoporphyrin derivative, is a medication used in conjunction with laser treatment to eliminate the abnormal blood vessels in the eye associated with conditions such as the wet form of macular degeneration. Verteporfin accumulates in these abnormal blood vessels and, when stimulated by nonthermal red light with a wavelength of 693 nm in the presence of oxygen, produces highly reactive short-lived singlet oxygen and other reactive oxygen radicals, resulting in local damage to the endothelium and blockage of the vessels.Verteporfin is transported in the plasma primarily by lipoproteins. Once verteporfin is activated by light in the presence of oxygen, highly reactive, short-lived singlet oxygen and reactive oxygen radicals are generated. Light activation of verteporfin results in local damage to neovascular endothelium, resulting in vessel occlusion. Damaged endothelium is known to release procoagulant and vasoactive factors through the lipo-oxygenase (leukotriene) and cyclo-oxygenase (eicosanoids such as thromboxane) pathways, resulting in platelet aggregation, fibrin clot formation and vasoconstriction. Verteporfin appears to somewhat preferentially accumulate in neovasculature, including choroidal neovasculature. However, animal models indicate that the drug is also present in the retina. As singlet oxygen and reactive oxygen radicals are cytotoxic, Verteporfin can also be used to destroy tumor cells."
261,"**Indicated** for:[label]    1) Symptomatic relief in rheumatoid arthritis.    2) Symptomatic relief in osteoarthritis.Nabumetone was originally developed as a non-acidic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).[label] It was thought to avoid trapping of the drug in the stomach by making it unable to dissociate into ions which was believed to reduce GI toxicity by limiting local action.[A179077] While slightly reduced, possibly due to a degree of cyclooxygenase-2 selectivity (COX-2), nabumetone still produces significant adverse effects in the GI tract.[label,A178903] The molecule itself is a pro-drug with its 6-methoxy-2-naphthylacetic acid (6-MNA) metabolite acting as a potent COX inhibitor similar in structure to [naproxen]. Nabumetone was developed by Smithkline Beecham under the trade name Relafen and first received FDA approval in December, 1991.[L6568]NSAIDs, like nabumetone, are well established as analgesics. NSAIDs reduce both peripheral and central sensitization of nociceptive neurons due to inflammation which contribute to hyperalgesia and allodynia.[T116,A179023] This sensitization occurs through reducing the action potential threshold in peripheral neurons, reducing the intensity of painful stimuli needed to produce a painful sensation. Centrally, activation of dorsal horn neurons occurs along with increased release of glutamate, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and substance P which increase the transmission of painful stimuli. Coupled with this is an inhibition glycinergic neurons which normally inhibit pain transmission, a phenomenon known as disinhibition. Increased activity ofn-methyl d-aspartate (NMDA) and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors leads to the establishment of central sensitization, allowing both mild painful and innocuous stimuli to produce action potentials in nociceptive projection neurons. NSAIDs are effective in reducing mild-moderate acute and chronic nociceptive pain, however, the usefulness of NSAIDs in neuropathic pain is limited.    The anti-inflammatory effect of NSAIDs is mediated by preventing vasodilation, increases in vascular permeability, and the release of cytokines from endothelial cells.[T116,A179044] These three effects together prevent immunocompetent cells from migrating to the site of injury thereby preventing additional damage and inflammation due to activation of the immune system at the site of damage. PGs also modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation, an activity which is thought to be of importance in arthritic conditions.    The anti-pyretic effect of NSAIDs is mediated through preventing increases in temperature by prostaglandins (PGs) via the hypothalamus.[T116] Activation of this process by other inflammatory mediators relies upon subsequent action by PGs, therefore NSAIDs are able to reduce fever due to these mediators as well.    The adverse effects of NSAIDs are related to their therapeutic effects.[T116] The same vasodilatory action which occurs in inflammation also serves to regulate blood flow to the kidneys through the afferent renal arteries. NSAIDs are widely known as nephrotoxic agents as the reduction in PGs produces vasoconstriction of these arteries resulting in reduced blood flow to the kidneys and a subsequent decline in renal function. Reductions in mucus and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> secretion in the stomach increases the risk of ulceration by limiting the protection mediated by PGs. Lastly, COX-2 selective agents like nabumetone can unbalance prothrombotic and antithrombotic prostanoid generation leading to increased platelet aggregation and increased risk of thrombosis.Nabumetone's active metabolite, 6-MNA, is an inhibitor of both COX-1 and COX-2 although it exhibits some COX-2 selectivity.[label,A178903] Inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 reduces conversion of arachidonic acid to PGs and thromboxane (TXA<sub>2</sub>). This reduction in prostanoid production is the common mechanism that mediates the effects of nambutone.    PGE<sub>2</sub> is the primary PG involved in modulation of nociception.[A179023] It mediates peripheral sensitization through a variety of effects.[T116,A179023] PGE<sub>2</sub> activates the G<sub>q</sub>-coupled EP<sub>1</sub> receptor leading to increased activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C pathway. Activation of this pathway releases intracellular stores of calcium which directly reduces action potential threshold and activates protein kinase C (PKC) which contributes to several indirect mechanisms. PGE<sub>2</sub> also activates the EP<sub>4</sub> receptor, coupled to G<sub>s</sub>, which activates the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (AC/PKA) signaling pathway. PKA and PKC both contribute to the potentiation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) potentiation, which increases sensitivity to heat stimuli. They also activate tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels and inhibit inward potassium currents. PKA further contributes to the activation of the P2X3 purine receptor and sensitization of T-type calcium channels. The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents. PGE<sub>2</sub> act via EP<sub>3</sub> to increase sensitivity to bradykinin and via EP<sub>2</sub> to further increase heat sensitivity. Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EP<sub>2</sub> receptor which couples to G<sub>s</sub>. Pre-synaptically, this receptor increases the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate, CGRP, and substance P. Post-synaptically it increases the activity of AMPA and NMDA receptors and produces inhibition of inhibitory glycinergic neurons. Together these lead to a reduced threshold of activating, allowing low intensity stimuli to generate pain signals. PGI<sub>2</sub> is known to play a role via its G<sub>s</sub>-coupled IP receptor although the magnitude of its contribution varies. It has been proposed to be of greater importance in painful inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. By limiting sensitization, both peripheral and central, via these pathways NSAIDs can effectively reduce inflammatory pain.    PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> contribute to acute inflammation via their IP and EP<sub>2</sub> receptors.[T116,A179044] Similarly to β adrenergic receptors these are G<sub>s</sub>-coupled and mediate vasodilation through the AC/PKA pathway. PGE<sub>2</sub> also contributes by increasing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and attracts the cells to the site of injury.[T116] PGD<sub>2</sub> plays a role in the activation of endothelial cell release of cytokines through its DP<sub>1</sub> receptor.[A179044] PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation through IP, EP<sub>2</sub>, and EP<sub>4</sub> receptors which is believed to be an important activity in the pathology of arthritic conditions. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation.    PGE<sub>2</sub> can cross the blood-brain barrier and act on excitatory G<sub>q</sub> EP<sub>3</sub> receptors on thermoregulatory neurons in the hypothalamus.[T116] This activation triggers an increase in heat-generation and a reduction in heat-loss to produce a fever. NSAIDs prevent the generation of PGE<sub>2</sub> thereby reducing the activity of these neurons.    The adverse effects of NSAIDs stem from the protective and regulatory roles of prostanoids which have been well-characterized.[T116] PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> regulate blood flow to the kidney by similar mechanisms to the vasodilation they produce in inflammation. Prevention of this regulation by NSAIDs produces vasoconstriction which limits renal function by reducing blood flow and the hydrostatic pressure which drives filtration. PGE<sub>2</sub> also regulates gastric protection via EP<sub>3</sub> receptors which are, in this location, coupled to G<sub>i</sub> which inhibits the AC/PKA pathway. This reduces the secretion of protons by H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase in parietal cells and increases the secretion of mucus and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> by superficial endothelial cells. Disruption of this protective action by NSAIDs lead to ulceration of the gastric mucosa. Lastly, disruption of PGI<sub>2</sub>, which opposes platelet aggregation, generation by COX-2 selective agents leads to an imbalance with TXA<sub>2</sub> generated by COX-1, which promotes aggregation of platelets, leading to increased risk of thrombosis. Since nabumetone is somewhat COX-2 selective it is thought to promote this imbalance and increase thrombotic risk.[A178903]"
262,"Used as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of peptic ulcer. Also used to treat nausea and vomiting due to motion sickness.A muscarinic antagonist used to study binding characteristics of muscarinic cholinergic receptors.Methscopolamine is a muscarinic antagonist structurally similar to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and acts by blocking the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and is thus classified as an anticholinergic. Methscopolamine has many uses including the prevention of motion sickness. It is not clear how Methscopolamine prevents nausea and vomiting due to motion sickness. The vestibular part of the ear is very important for balance. When a person becomes disoriented due to motion, the vestibule sends a signal through nerves to the vomiting center in the brain, and vomiting occurs. Acetylcholine is a chemical that nerves use to transmit messages to each other. It is believe that Methscopolamine prevents communication between the nerves of the vestibule and the vomiting center in the brain by blocking the action of acetylcholine. Methscopolamine also may work directly on the vomiting center. Methscopolamine must be taken before the onset of motion sickness to be effective.Methscopolamine acts by interfering with the transmission of nerve impulses by acetylcholine in the parasympathetic nervous system (specifically the vomiting center). It does so by acting as a muscarinic antagonist."

It was patented in 1905 by Emil Fischer of Merck.Metharbital, a barbiturate, is used for the treatment of short term insomnia. It belongs to a group of medicines called central nervous system (CNS) depressants that induce drowsiness and relieve tension or nervousness. Little analgesia is conferred by barbiturates; their use in the presence of pain may result in excitation.Metharbital binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl- ionopore at the GABAA receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl- ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged. All of these effects are associated with marked decreases in GABA-sensitive neuronal calcium conductance (gCa). The net result of barbiturate action is acute potentiation of inhibitory GABAergic tone. Barbiturates also act through potent (if less well characterized) and direct inhibition of excitatory AMPA-type glutamate receptors, resulting in a profound suppression of glutamatergic neurotransmission."
264,"For the treatment of adults (&ge;18 years of age) with the following infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms: (1) uncomplicated urethral or cervical gonorrhea due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae, (2) uncomplicated urinary tract infections (cystitis) due to Escherichia coli,Staphylococcus epidermidis, or Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and (3) complicated urinary tract infections due to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis,Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, or Enterobacter cloacae.A broad-spectrum 6-fluoronaphthyridinone antibacterial agent (fluoroquinolones) structurally related to nalidixic acid.Enoxacin is a quinolone/fluoroquinolone antibiotic. Enoxacin is bactericidal and its mode of action depends on blocking of bacterial DNA replication by binding itself to an enzyme called DNA gyrase, which allows the untwisting required to replicate one DNA double helix into two. Enoxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Enoxacin may be active against pathogens resistant to drugs that act by different mechanisms.Enoxacin exerts its bactericidal action via the inhibition of the essential bacterial enzyme DNA gyrase (DNA Topoisomerase II)."
265,"For the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, backache, and pain.Tenoxicam, an antiinflammatory agent with analgesic and antipyretic properties, is used to treat osteoarthritis and control acute pain.Tenoxicam, an antiinflammatory agent with analgesic and antipyretic properties, is used to treat osteoarthritis and control acute pain.The antiinflammatory effects of tenoxicam may result from the inhibition of the enzyme cycooxygenase and the subsequent peripheral inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. As prostaglandins sensitize pain receptors, their inhibition accounts for the peripheral analgesic effects of tenoxicam. Antipyresis may occur by central action on the hypothalamus, resulting in peripheral dilation, increased cutaneous blood flow, and subsequent heat loss."
266,"Dronabinol is indicated for the treatment of anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS, and nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments.[L43438]Dronabinol (marketed as Marinol) is a synthetic form of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ�?THC), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis (marijuana). THC demonstrates its effects through weak partial agonist activity at Cannabinoid-1 (CB1R) and Cannabinoid-2 (CB2R) receptors, which results in the well-known effects of smoking cannabis such as increased appetite, reduced pain, and changes in emotional and cognitive processes. Due to its evidence as an appetite stimulant and an anti-nauseant, Dronabinol is approved for use in anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS and for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments [FDA Label].    Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are the two most abundant cannabinoids found naturally in the resin of the marijuana plant, both of which are pharmacologically active due to their interaction with cannabinoid receptors that are found throughout the body [A32830]. While both CBD and THC are used for medicinal purposes, they have different receptor activity, function, and physiological effects. If not provided in their activated form (such as through synthetic forms like Dronabinol or [DB00486]), THC and CBD are obtained through conversion from their precursors, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid-A (THCA-A) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), through decarboxylation reactions. This can be achieved through heating, smoking, vaporization, or baking of dried unfertilized female cannabis flowers.    From a pharmacological perspective, Cannabis' diverse receptor profile explains its potential application for such a wide variety of medical conditions. Cannabis contains more than 400 different chemical compounds, of which 61 are considered cannabinoids, a class of compounds that act upon endogenous cannabinoid receptors of the body [A32584]. The endocannabinoid system is widely distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system (via the Cannabinoid Receptors CB1 and CB2) and plays a role in many physiological processes such as inflammation, cardiovascular function, learning, pain, memory, stress and emotional regulation, and the sleep/wake cycle among many others [A32824]. CB1 receptors are found in both the central and peripheral nervous system, and are most abundant in the hippocampus and amygdala, which are the areas of the brain responsible for short-term memory storage and emotional regulation. CB2 receptors are mainly located in the peripheral nervous system and can be found on lymphoid tissue where they are involved in regulation of immune function [A32676].Dronabinol-induced sympathomimetic activity may result in tachycardia and/or conjunctival injection. Its effects on blood pressure are inconsistent, but subjects have experienced orthostatic hypotension and/or syncope upon abrupt standing.[L43438]    Dronabinol also demonstrates reversible effects on appetite, mood, cognition, memory, and perception. These phenomena appear to be dose-related, increasing in frequency with higher dosages, and subject to great inter-patient variability. After oral administration, dronabinol capsules have an onset of action of approximately 0.5 to 1 hour and a peak effect at 2 to 4 hours. Duration of action for psychoactive effects is 4 to 6 hours, but the appetite stimulant effect of dronabinol may continue for 24 hours or longer after administration.[L43438]    Tachyphylaxis and tolerance develop to some of the cardiovascular and CNS pharmacologic effects of dronabinol with chronic use, suggesting an indirect effect on sympathetic neurons. In a study of the pharmacodynamics of chronic dronabinol exposure, healthy male subjects (N = 12) received 12 times the maximum dose for anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS of dronabinol capsules in divided doses for 16 days. An initial tachycardia induced by dronabinol was replaced successively by normal sinus rhythm and then bradycardia. A decrease in supine blood pressure, made worse by standing, was also observed initially. These  subjects developed tolerance to the cardiovascular and subjective adverse CNS effects of dronabinol within 12 days of treatment initiation.[L43438]     Tachyphylaxis and tolerance do not appear to develop to the appetite stimulant effect of dronabinol. In clinical studies of dronabinol capsules in AIDS patients, at the recommended dosage, the appetite stimulant effect was sustained for up to five months.[L43438]Dronabinol is a synthetic form of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ�?THC), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis (marijuana). THC demonstrates its effects through weak partial agonist activity at Cannabinoid-1 (CB1R) and Cannabinoid-2 (CB2R) receptors, which results in the well-known effects of smoking cannabis such as increased appetite, reduced pain, and changes in emotional and cognitive processes."
267,"Montelukast is indicated for:    (a) the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma in adults and pediatric patients who are 12 months of age and older[L6301], although other regional health authorities specifically note this indication for adults and adolescents who are 15 years and older[L6304,L6307] and also include indications for preventing day and night-time symptoms, and the treatment of acetylsalicylic acid-sensitive asthma[L6304];    (b) the prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) in patients who are 6 years of age and older[L6301], although other regional health authorities specifically note this indication for adults and adolescents who are 15 years and older[L6304,L6307]; and    (c) the relief of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis in patients 2 years of age and older and perennial allergic rhinitis in patients 6 months of age and older[L6301], although other regional health authorities specifically note the relief of seasonal allergic rhinitis symptoms for adults and adolescents who are 15 years and older[L6304,L6307].    Furthermore, some formulations like chewable montelukast tablets may also be specifically indicated by particular regulatory bodies for the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma, including the prevention of day and night-time symptoms, the treatment of acetylsalicylic acid based asthma, and the prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in adult and pediatric patients aged 2 and older[L6328], between the ages 2 and 5[L6325], or between the ages of 6 and 14 years.[L6331]    Moreover, when employed for such indications montelukast is considered effective as monotherapy or when combined with other medications indicated for the maintenance treatment of chronic asthma.[L6304,L6328] For instance, montelukast and inhaled corticosteroids can be used concomitantly to demonstrate additive effects to control asthma or to decrease the necessary inhaled corticosteroid dose while still maintaining clinical stability.[L6304,L6328]    Additionally, in patients who continue to experience asthma symptoms, montelukast can also be combined with an 'as required' short-acting beta-agonist, an inhaled corticosteroid, or inhaled corticosteroid paired with a long-acting beta-agonist.[L6304,L6328]Montelukast was first approved for clinical use by the US FDA in 1998 as Merck's brand name Singulair.[L6301] The medication is a member of the leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) category of drugs.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] Although capable of demonstrating effectiveness, the use of such LTRAs like montelukast is typically in addition to or complementary with the use of inhaled corticosteroids or other agents in asthma step therapy.[A178645] Regardless, in 2008-2009, there were FDA-led investigations into the possibility of montelukast to elicit neuropsychiatric effects like agitation, hallucinations, suicidal behaviour, and others in individuals who used the medication.[A178651] And although these kinds of effects are currently included in the official prescribing information for montelukast,[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] the drug still sees extensive use worldwide via millions of prescriptions annually and has since become available as a generic and as a brand name product.Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist that demonstrates a marked affinity and selectivity to the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor type-1 in preference to many other crucial airway receptors like the prostanoid, cholinergic, or beta-adrenergic receptors.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] As a consequence, the agent can elicit substantial blockage of LTD4 leukotriene-mediated bronchoconstriction with doses as low as 5 mg.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] Moreover, a placebo-controlled, crossover study (n=12) demonstrated that montelukast is capable of inhibiting early and late phase bronchoconstriction caused by antigen challenge by 75% and 57% respectively.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]    In particular, it has been documented that montelukast can cause bronchodilation as soon as within 2 hours of oral administration.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] This action can also be additive to the bronchodilation caused by the concomitant use of a beta agonist.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] Nevertheless, clinical investigations performed with adults 15 years of age and older revealed that no additional clinical benefit is obtained when doses of montelukast greater than 10 mg a day are used.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]    Additionally, in clinical trials with adults and pediatric asthmatic patients aged 6 to 14 years, it was also determined that montelukast can reduce mean peripheral blood eosinophils by about 13% to 15% from baseline in comparison to placebo during double-blind treatment periods.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] At the same time, in patients aged 15 years and older who were experiencing seasonal allergic rhinitis, the use of montelukast caused a median reduction of 13% in peripheral blood eosinophil counts when compared to placebo as well.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]Cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLT) like LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4, among others, are eicosanoids released by a variety of cells like mast cells and eosinophils.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] When such CysLT bind to corresponding CysLT receptors like CysLT type-1 receptors located on respiratory airway smooth muscle cells, airway macrophages, and on various pro-inflammatory cells like eosinophils and some specific myeloid stem cells activities that facilitate the pathophysiology of asthma and allergic rhinitis are stimulated.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]    In particular, CysLT-mediated airway bronchoconstriction, occluding mucous secretion, vascular permeability, and eosinophil recruitment are all types of effects that facilitate asthma.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] Alternatively, in allergic rhinitis, CysLTs are released by the nasal mucosa when exposed to allergens during both early and late phase reactions and participate in eliciting symptoms of allergic rhinitis like a congested nose and airway.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]    Subsequently, montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist that binds with high affinity and selectivity to the CysLT type 1 receptor, which consequently assists in inhibiting any physiological actions of CysLTs like LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 at the receptor that may facilitate asthma or allergic rhinitis.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]"
268,"Fluoxetine is indicated for both acute and maintenance treatment of major depressive disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and bulimia nervosa; however, it is only indicated for acute treatment of panic disorder independent of whether agoraphobia is present.[L7664] Fluoxetine is additionally indicated for the treatment of female patients with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).[L40833]Fluoxetine is a 2nd generation antidepressant categorized as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).[A181673] It gained FDA approval in 1987 and although it was initially intended for the treatment of depression, today it is commonly prescribed to manage depression in addition to various other pathologies.[L7721]Fluoxetine blocks the serotonin reuptake transporter in the presynaptic terminal, which ultimately results in sustained levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in certain brain areas.[L7721] However, fluoxetine binds with relatively poor affinity to 5-HT, dopaminergic, adrenergic, cholinergic, muscarinic, and histamine receptors which explains why it has a far more desirable adverse effect profile compared to earlier developed classes of antidepressants such as tricyclic antidepressants.[L7721][A181673] The monoaminergic hypothesis of depression emerged in 1965 and linked depression with dysfunction of neurotransmitters such as noradrenaline and serotonin.[L7721] Indeed, low levels of serotonin have been observed in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients diagnosed with depression.[A181793] As a result of this hypothesis, drugs that modulate levels of serotonin such as fluoxetine were developed.[L7721]    Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and as the name suggests, it exerts it's therapeutic effect by inhibiting the presynaptic reuptake of the neurotransmitter serotonin.[A181673] As a result, levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) are increased in various parts of the brain.[L7721] Further, fluoxetine has high affinity for 5-HT transporters, weak affinity for noradrenaline transporters and no affinity for dopamine transporters indicating that it is 5-HT selective.[L7721]    Fluoxetine interacts to a degree with the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor and it has been suggested that through this mechanism, it is able to increase noradrenaline and dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex.[L7721]"
269,"Methohexital is indicated for use as an intravenous anaesthetic. It has also been commonly used to induce deep sedation.An intravenous anesthetic with a short duration of action that may be used for induction of anesthesia.Methohexital, a barbiturate, is used for the induction of anesthesia prior to the use of other general anesthetic agents and for induction of anesthesia for short surgical, diagnostic, or therapeutic procedures associated with minimal painful stimuli. Little analgesia is conferred by barbiturates; their use in the presence of pain may result in excitation.Methohexital binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl- ionopore at the GABAA receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl- ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged."
270,"Chlordiazepoxide is indicated for the management of anxiety disorders or for the short-term relief of symptoms of anxiety, withdrawal symptoms of acute alcoholism, and preoperative apprehension and anxiety.[L44893]An anxiolytic benzodiazepine derivative with anticonvulsant, sedative, and amnesic properties. It has also been used in the symptomatic treatment of alcohol withdrawal.Chlordiazepoxide has antianxiety, sedative, appetite-stimulating and weak analgesic actions. The drug seems to block EEG arousal from stimulation in the brain stem reticular formation. The drug has been studied extensively in many species of animals and these studies are suggestive of action on the limbic system of the brain, which recent evidence indicates is involved in emotional responses. Hostile monkeys were made tame by oral drug doses which did not cause sedation. Chlordiazepoxide revealed a ""taming"" action with the elimination of fear and aggression. The taming effect of chlordiazepoxide was further demonstrated in rats made vicious by lesions in the septal area of the brain. The drug dosage which effectively blocked the vicious reaction was well below the dose which caused sedation in these animals.Chlordiazepoxide binds to stereospecific benzodiazepine (BZD) binding sites on GABA (A) receptor complexes at several sites within the central nervous system, including the limbic system and reticular formation. This results in an increased binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA to the GABA(A) receptor. BZDs, therefore, enhance GABA-mediated chloride influx through GABA receptor channels, causing membrane hyperpolarization. The net neuro-inhibitory effects result in the observed sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, and muscle relaxant properties."
271,"For the treatment of schizophrenia; to control nausea and vomiting; for relief of restlessness and apprehension before surgery; for acute intermittent porphyria; as an adjunct in the treatment of tetanus; to control the manifestations of the manic type of manic-depressive illness; for relief of intractable hiccups; for the treatment of severe behavioral problems in children (1 to 12 years of age) marked by combativeness and/or explosive hyperexcitable behavior (out of proportion to immediate provocations), and in the short-term treatment of hyperactive children who show excessive motor activity with accompanying conduct disorders consisting of some or all of the following symptoms: impulsivity, difficulty sustaining attention, aggressivity, mood lability, and poor frustration tolerance.The prototypical phenothiazine antipsychotic drug. Like the other drugs in this class, chlorpromazine's antipsychotic actions are thought to be due to long-term adaptation by the brain to blocking dopamine receptors. Chlorpromazine has several other actions and therapeutic uses, including as an antiemetic and in the treatment of intractable hiccup.Chlorpromazine is a psychotropic agent indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia. It also exerts sedative and antiemetic activity. Chlorpromazine has actions at all levels of the central nervous system-primarily at subcortical levels-as well as on multiple organ systems. Chlorpromazine has strong antiadrenergic and weaker peripheral anticholinergic activity; ganglionic blocking action is relatively slight. It also possesses slight antihistaminic and antiserotonin activity.Chlorpromazine acts as an antagonist (blocking agent) on different postsysnaptic receptors -on dopaminergic-receptors (subtypes D1, D2, D3 and D4 - different antipsychotic properties on productive and unproductive symptoms), on serotonergic-receptors (5-HT1 and 5-HT2, with anxiolytic, antidepressive and antiaggressive properties as well as an attenuation of extrapypramidal side-effects, but also leading to weight gain, fall in blood pressure, sedation and ejaculation difficulties), on histaminergic-receptors (H1-receptors, sedation, antiemesis, vertigo, fall in blood pressure and weight gain), alpha1/alpha2-receptors (antisympathomimetic properties, lowering of blood pressure, reflex tachycardia, vertigo, sedation, hypersalivation and incontinence as well as sexual dysfunction, but may also attenuate pseudoparkinsonism - controversial) and finally on muscarinic (cholinergic) M1/M2-receptors (causing anticholinergic symptoms like dry mouth, blurred vision, obstipation, difficulty/inability to urinate, sinus tachycardia, ECG-changes and loss of memory, but the anticholinergic action may attenuate extrapyramidal side-effects).  Additionally, Chlorpromazine is a weak presynaptic inhibitor of Dopamine reuptake, which may lead to (mild) antidepressive and antiparkinsonian effects. This action could also account for psychomotor agitation and amplification of psychosis (very rarely noted in clinical use)."
272,"For the prophylaxis and treatment of illness caused by various strains of influenza A virus in adults.An RNA synthesis inhibitor that is used as an antiviral agent in the prophylaxis and treatment of influenza.Rimantadine, a cyclic amine, is a synthetic antiviral drug and a derivate of adamantane, like a similar drug amantadine. Rimantadine is inhibitory to the in vitro replication of influenza A virus isolates from each of the three antigenic subtypes (H1N1, H2H2 and H3N2) that have been isolated from man. Rimantadine has little or no activity against influenza B virus. Rimantadine does not appear to interfere with the immunogenicity of inactivated influenza A vaccine.The mechanism of action of rimantadine is not fully understood. Rimantadine appears to exert its inhibitory effect early in the viral replicative cycle, possibly inhibiting the uncoating of the virus. The protein coded by the M2 gene of influenza A may play an important role in rimantadine susceptibility."
273,"The amikacin sulfate injection is indicated in the short-term treatment of serious bacterial infections due to susceptible strains of gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas species, Escherichia coli, species of indole-positive and indole-negative Proteus, Providencia species, Klebsiella-Enterobacter-Serratia species, as well as Acinetobacter (Mima-Herellea) species.[F1954]    Clinical studies have shown amikacin sulfate injection to be effective in bacterial septicemia (including neonatal sepsis); in serious infections of the respiratory tract, bones and joints, central nervous system (including meningitis) and skin and soft tissue; intra-abdominal infections (including peritonitis); and in burns and postoperative infections (including post-vascular surgery).[F1954]    Clinical studies have shown amikacin also to be effective in serious, complicated, and recurrent urinary tract infections due to the above organisms. Aminoglycosides, including amikacin, are not indicated in uncomplicated first-time episodes of urinary tract infections unless the causative organisms are not susceptible to antibiotics which are less toxic.[F1954]    In September 2018, a new indication with a new dosage route was approved for this drug. Amikacin liposome inhalation suspension was approved for the treatment of lung disease caused by a group of bacteria, Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) in a limited population of patients with the disease who do not respond to conventional treatment (refractory disease).[L4673] This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on achieving sputum culture conversion (defined as 3 consecutive negative monthly sputum cultures) by Month 6 of treatment. Clinical benefit has not yet been established.[Label]    **Important notes regarding Staphylococcus and Sensitivity testing:**    Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant strains, is the principal Gram-positive organism sensitive to amikacin.  The use of amikacin in the treatment of staphylococcal infections should be restricted only to second-line therapy, and should be limited to only those patients suffering from severe infections caused by susceptible strains of staphylococcus species who have failed to show sensitivity to other available antibiotics.[F1949]    Bacteriologic studies should be performed to identify causative organisms and their susceptibilities to amikacin. Amikacin may be used as initial therapy in suspected gram-negative infections and therapy may be initiated before obtaining the results of susceptibility testing.[Label,F1949,F1954]Amikacin is a semi-synthetic aminoglycoside antibiotic that is derived from kanamycin A.[FDA label] Amikacin is synthesized by acylation with the l-(-)-γ-amino-α-hydroxybutyryl side chain at the C-1 amino group of the deoxystreptamine moiety of kanamycin A.[A39531]    Amikacin's unique property is that it exerts activity against more resistant gram-negative bacilli such as Acinetobacter baumanii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Amikacin also exerts excellent activity against most aerobic gram-negative bacilli from the Enterobacteriaceae family, including Nocardia and some Mycobacterium (M. avium-intracellulare, M. chelonae, and M. fortuitum)[L4680]. M. avium-intracellulare (MAC) is a type of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) found in water and soil. Symptoms of this disease include a persistent cough, fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, and shortness of breath and the coughing up of blood.[L4680]    Several forms of amikacin are used currently, including an intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) injection.[F1949] In September 2018, a liposomal inhalation suspension of this drug was approved by the FDA for the treatment of lung disease caused by Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) bacteria in a small population of patients with the disease who do not respond to traditional treatment.[L4680,L4681]Amikacin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic. Aminoglycosides bind to the bacteria, causing misreading of t-RNA, leaving bacteria unable to synthesize proteins vital to their growth. Aminoglycosides are useful mainly in the treatment infections involving aerobic, Gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and Enterobacter. In addition, some mycobacteria, including the bacteria that cause tuberculosis, are susceptible to aminoglycosides. Infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria can also be treated with aminoglycosides, however, other antibiotics may be more potent and less toxic to humans.[Label,F1949]The primary mechanism of action of amikacin is the same as that for all aminoglycosides. It binds to bacterial 30S ribosomal subunits and interferes with mRNA binding and tRNA acceptor sites, interfering with bacterial growth. This leads to disruption of normal protein synthesis and production of non-functional or toxic peptides. Other actions have been postulated for drugs of this class.[Label,F1949,F1950] Amikacin, as well as the rest of the aminoglycosides, are generally bacteriocidal against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.[L4680,F1954]"
274,"Lenalidomide is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma (MM) in combination with dexamethasone. It is also indicated as maintenance therapy in multiple myeloma following autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT).    It is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities.    Lenalidomide is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) whose disease has relapsed or progressed after two prior therapies, one of which included bortezomib.    In combination with a rituximab product, lenalidomide is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously treated follicular lymphoma (FL) or previously treated marginal zone lymphoma (MZL).[L16028]Lenalidomide (previously referred to as CC-5013) is an immunomodulatory drug with potent antineoplastic, anti-angiogenic, and anti-inflammatory properties.[A228553] It is a 4-amino-glutamyl analogue of [thalidomide] [A228543] and like thalidomide, lenalidomide exists as a racemic mixture of the active S(-) and R(+) forms.[A228708] However, lenalidomide is much safer and potent than thalidomide, with fewer adverse effects and toxicities.[A714, A228543] Thalidomide and its analogues, including lenalidomide, are referred to as immunomodulatory imide drugs (also known as cereblon modulators), which are a class of immunomodulatory drugs that contain an imide group. Lenalidomide works through various mechanisms of actions that promote malignant cell death and enhance host immunity.[A228708] Available as oral capsules, lenalidomide is approved by the FDA and EU for the treatment of multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndromes, mantle cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and marginal zone lymphoma in selected patients.[L16028] Due to severe teratogenicity, pregnancy must be excluded before the start of treatment and patients must enroll in the lenalidomide Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program to ensure contraception adherence.[A228708]In hematological malignancies, the immune system is deregulated in the form of altered cytokine networks in the tumour microenvironment, defective T cell regulation of host-tumour immune interactions, and diminished NK cell activity.[A228543] Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent with antineoplastic, antiangiogenic, and anti-inflammatory properties.[A228628] Lenalidomide exerts direct cytotoxicity by increasing apoptosis and inhibiting the proliferation of hematopoietic malignant cells.[A228708] It delays tumour growth in nonclinical hematopoietic tumour models _in vivo_, including multiple myeloma.[L16028] Lenalidomide also works to limit the invasion or metastasis of tumour cells and inhibits angiogenesis.[A228708]    Lenalidomide also mediates indirect antitumour effects via its immunomodulatory actions: it inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are implicated in various hematologic malignancies. Lenalidomide enhances the host immunity by stimulating T cell proliferation and enhancing the activity of natural killer (NK) cells.[A713, A228703, A228708] Lenalidomide is about 100�?000 times more potent in stimulating T cell proliferation than [thalidomide].[A228543] _In vitro_, it enhances antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), which is even more pronounced when used in combination with rituximab.[L16028] Due to its anti-inflammatory properties, lenalidomide has been investigated in the context of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.[A229418] Lenalidomide is a drug with multiple mechanisms of action. Lenalidomide exerts immunomodulating effects by altering cytokine production, regulating T cell co-stimulation, and enhancing the NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity.[A228543] Lenalidomide directly inhibits the cullin ring E3 ubiquitin ligase complex: upon binding to cereblon, a substrate adaptor of the complex, lenalidomide modulates substrate specificity of the complex to recruit substrate proteins of the ligase, including Ikaros (IKZF1), Aiolos (IKZF3), and CK1α.[L16028] These substrates are then tagged for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. IKZF1 and IKZF3 are B-cell transcription factors that are essential for B-cell differentiation and survival of malignant cells. IKZF3 also regulates the expression of interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4), which is a transcription factor that regulates the aberrant myeloma-specific gene. The immunomodulatory actions of lenalidomide can be partly explained by the degradation of IKZF3, since it is a repressor of the interleukin 2 gene (IL2): as lenalidomide decreases the level of IKZF3, the production of IL-2 increases, thereby increasing the proliferation of natural killer (NK), NKT cells, and CD4+ T cells.[A228703] Lenalidomide inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-12, while elevating the production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.[A228543] Lenalidomide acts as a T-cell co-stimulatory molecule that promotes CD3 T-cell proliferation and increases the production of IL-2 and IFN-γ in T lymphocytes, which enhances NK cell cytotoxicity and ADCC. It inhibits the expression and function of T-regulatory cells, which are often overabundant in some hematological malignancies.[A228708]     Lenalidomide directly exerts antitumour effects by inhibiting the proliferation and inducing apoptosis of tumour cells. Lenalidomide triggers the activation of pro-apoptotic caspase-8, enhances tumour cell sensitivity to FAS-induced apoptosis, and downregulates NF-κB, an anti-apoptotic protein.[A228708] Independent of its immunomodulatory effects, lenalidomide mediates anti-angiogenic effects by inhibiting angiogenic growth factors released by tumour cells, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblastic-growth factor (BFGF), and hepatocyte-growth factor. _In vitro_, lenalidomide inhibits cell adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1, LFA-1, β2 and β3 integrins, as well as gap-junction function, thereby preventing metastasis of malignant cells.[A228708] "
275,"Celecoxib is indicated for symptomatic treatment of adult osteoarthritis (OA) and adult rheumatoid arthritis (RA).[L7646] Celecoxib is not a substitute for aspirin for cardiovascular event prophylaxis.[L7646]     It may be also be used to treat acute pain from various sources, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in children over 2, ankylosing spondylitis, and primary dysmenorrhea.[L38949]Celecoxib, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) which is known for its decreased risk of causing gastrointestinal bleeding compared to other NSAIDS.[A181544] It is used to manage symptoms of various types of arthritis pain and in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) to reduce precancerous polyps in the colon.[A181532] It is marketed by Pfizer under the brand name Celebrex, and was initially granted FDA approval in 1998.[L7604]     Interestingly, selective COX-2 inhibitors (especially celecoxib), have been evaluated as potential cancer chemopreventive and therapeutic drugs in clinical trials for a variety of malignancies.[A34124]  Celecoxib inhibits cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) enzyme, reducing pain and inflammation. It is important to note that though the risk of bleeding with celecoxib is lower than with certain other NSAIDS, it exists nonetheless and caution must be observed when it is administered to those with a high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.[L7607]    **A note on the risk of cardiovascular events**    Significant concerns regarding the safety of COX-2 selective NSAIDs emerged in the early 2000s. [Rofecoxib], another member of the COX-2 inhibitor drug class, also known as Vioxx, was withdrawn from the market due to prothrombotic cardiovascular risks.[L7622] Following an FDA Advisory Committee meeting in 2005, in which data from large clinical outcome trials were evaluated, the FDA concluded that the risk for cardiovascular thrombotic events for both COX-2 selective NSAIDs and nonselective NSAIDs was evident.[L3293] It was determined that the benefits of celecoxib treatment, however, outweighed the risks.[L7622] Postmarketing cardiovascular outcomes trial (PRECISION) revealed that the lowest possible dose of celecoxib was similar in cardiovascular safety to moderate strength doses of both naproxen and ibuprofen. Patients who had previous cardiovascular events including acute MI, coronary revascularization, or coronary stent insertion were not evaluated in the trial. It is not advisable to administer NSAIDS to these groups of patients.[L3293]  Unlike most NSAIDs, which inhibit both types of cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2), celecoxib is a selective noncompetitive inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme. COX-2 is expressed heavily in inflamed tissues where it is induced by inflammatory mediators.[L7646] The inhibition of this enzyme reduces the synthesis of metabolites that include prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), prostacyclin (PGI2), thromboxane (TXA2), prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), and prostaglandin F2 (PGF2). Resultant inhibition of these mediators leads to the alleviation of pain and inflammation.[A34124,L7646]     By inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) cause mucosal damage, ulceration and ulcer complication throughout the gastrointestinal tract.[L7646] Celecoxib poses less of an ulceration risk than other NSAIDS, owing to its decreased effect on gastric mucosal prostaglandin synthesis when compared to placebo.[A34152]     Celecoxib exerts anticancer effects by binding to the cadherin-11 (CDH11)protein,  which is thought to be involved in the progression of tumors, and inhibiting the 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1) signaling mechanism.[T647,A11861] In addition, celecoxib has been found to inhibit carbonic anhydrase enzymes 2 and 3, further enhancing its anticancer effects.[A28426,A20066]    As mentioned in the pharmacodynamics section of this drug entry, celecoxib may cause an increased risk of thrombotic events. The risk of thrombosis resulting from COX-2 inhibition is caused by the vasoconstricting actions of thromboxane A2, leading to enhanced platelet aggregation, which is uncontrolled when the actions of prostacyclin, a platelet aggregation inhibitor, are suppressed through the inhibition of COX-2.[L7622]"
276,"**Topical**    Indicated for the treatment of persistent (non-transient) facial erythema of rosacea in adults 18 years of age or older.[L6535]Brimonidine is an alpha-adrenergic agonist and 2-imidazoline derivative that was first introduced in 1996.[A178951] It is considered to be a third generation alpha-2 aadrenergic receptor agonist, since it displays preferential binding at alpha-2 adrenoceptors over alpha-1 receptors.[A179002] Brimonidine displays a higher selectivity toward the alpha-2 adrenergic receptors than [clonidine] or [apraclonidine], which are also alpha-2 adrenergic agonists.[A178969] Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists are members of the ocular hypotensive agent drug class that are used in the chronic treatment of glaucoma. Early treatment and management of glaucoma, which predominantly involves the lowering of intraocular pressure, is critical since glaucoma is considered to be a common cause of blindness worldwide.[A178948,A178969]     Ophthalmically, brimonidine is used to lower intraocular pressure by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow. Because it is oxidately stable, brimonidine is associated with fewer reports of ocular allergic reactions compared to other alpha-2 adrenergic agonists.[A178969] The ophthalmic solution of brimonidine was first approved by the FDA in 1996 as Alphagan [label] and brimonidine is the only selective alpha-adrenergic receptor agonist approved for chronic treatment in glaucoma.Unlike nonselective beta-blockers used in ocular hypertension, brimonidine is not associated with significantly adverse cardiopulmonary side effects.[A178945] Thus brimonidine is an effective and safe alternative to beta-blockers, in patients with, or at high risk for, cardiopulmonary disease.[A178948] The topical form of brimonidine was approved by the FDA in August 2013 for the symptomatic treatment of persistent facial erythema of rosacea in adults. It is marketed under the brand name Mirvaso.[L6535] Brimonidine is the first topical treatment approved for facial erythema of rosacea.[A178978]Brimonidine is a highly selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist that is 1000-fold more selective for the alpha2-adrenergic receptor than the alpha1-adrenergic receptor.[L6544] This characteristic gives the drug some therapeutic advantages, since it reduces the risk of systemic side effects, such as systemic hypotension, bradycardia, and sedation. In addition, there is a reduction in the risk for developing alpha-1 mediated ocular unwanted effects, such as conjunctival blanching, mydriasis, and eyelid retraction.[A179002] However, despite high alpha-2 receptor specificity, brimonidine may still produce alpha-1 adrenoceptor-mediated ocular effects, such as conjunctival vasoconstriction.[A178969] Brimonidine has a peak ocular hypotensive effect occurring at two hours post-dosing.[label] In a randomized, double-blind clinical study, ocular administration of 0.2% brimonidine in healthy volunteers resulted in a 23% reduction of mean intraocular pressure from baseline at 3 hours following administration.[A178951] In comparative studies consisting of patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, the ocular hypotensive effect of brimonidine was maintained during treatment periods of up to 1 year.[A178945]     Brimonidine mediates vasoconstrictive effects and it was shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory properties in _ex vivo_ human skin model and _in vivo_ inflammation models.[A179041] In a clinial trials consisting of adults with moderate to severe facial erythema of rosacea, brimonidine was shown to improve the extent of redness at 3 hours after application, compared to placebo.[L6544] It was shown to be a potent vasoconstrictor of human subcutaneous vessels with a diameter of less than 200 µm. In _in vivo_ mouse inflammation models, brimonidine displayed anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting edema.[A178978] In a randomized, double-blind study, brimonidine reduced erythema for the 12 hours of the study in a dose-dependent manner.[A178978]    When adminsitered systemically, brimonidine was shown to cause cardiovascular effects by decreasing blood pressure, decreasing heart and respiratory rate, and prolonging the PR interval in the electrocardiogram. This is due to the targeting of adrenoceptors by the drug.[A178963,A178966] Although the clinical significance has not been established, there is evidence that brimonidine exhibits neuroprotective activity in experimental models of cerebral ischemia and optic nerve injury.[A178969] _In vitro_ studies show that brimonidine mediated protective effects on neuronal cells from kainate acid insult and on cultured retinal ganglion cells from glutamate-induced cytotoxicity, which is a possible mediator of secondary neuronal degeneration in human glaucoma. Neuroprotective actions of brimonidine were also demonstrated in rat models of acute retinal ischemia and chronic IOP elevation. It has been proposed that brimonidine may exert neuroprotective effects on the retina and optic nerve by enhancing intrinsic retinal ganglion cell survival mechanisms and/or induction of neuronal survival factors, such as bFGF.[A178951] However, further investigations are needed to conclude on these possible therapeutic benefits of the drug.In the eye, alpha-1 adrenoceptors play a role in vasoconstriction, mydriasis, eyelid retraction, and elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) whereas alpha-2 adrenoceptors are responsible for IOP reduction via a complex Gi-coupled signaling cascade pathway. Activation of alpha-2 receptors leads to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and reduction of cyclic AMP levels. As a result, there is a decrease in norpinephrine (NE) release at the synaptic junction, NE-induced stimulation of beta-2 adrenoceptors, and production of aqueous humor by the ciliary epithelium.[A178969] An elevated IOP is the most significant risk factor for developing glaucomatous optic neuropathy, which is associated with progressive visual field loss and functional disability if left untreated.[A179002] Regardless of the etiology of the disease, the aim of current therapies for glaucoma is to reduce IOP, as reduction of IOP significantly reduces the risk of progression of vision loss even when IOP is already within the normal range.[A36674] When administered ophthalmically, brimonidine is rapidly absorbed into the eye, acts as an agonist at ocular alpha-2 adrenoceptors and lowers IOP via a dual mechanism of action.[A178981] It is proposed that initial dosing of the drug causes a reduction in aqueous humour production and chronic dosing leads to an increase in uveoscleral outflow.[A179002] Brimonidine does not affect episcleral venous pressure.[A178969] By reducing IOP, brimonidine aims to reduce the likelihood of glaucomatous visual field loss in ocular hypertension, and slow the progression of visual field defect in established open-angle glaucoma.[A178951] When applied topically on skin, brimonidine reduces erythema through direct vasocontriction of small arteries and veins.[A178978] As brimonidine mediates a potent peripheral vasoconstrictive activity by selectively working on the alpha-2 adrenoceptors, the use of brimonidine is thought to be efficacious for the treatment of facial erythema of rosacea, which is thought to arise from vasomotor instability and abnormal vasodilation of the superficial cutaneous vasculature of the face.[A178984]"
277,"Used to treat infections caused by penicillinase-producing staphylococci which have demonstrated susceptibility to the drug.One of the penicillins which is resistant to penicillinase.Dicloxacillin is a beta-lactamase resistant penicillin similar to oxacillin. Dicloxacillin has <i>in vitro</i> activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The bactericidal activity of dicloxacillin results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis and is mediated through dicloxacillin binding to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). Dicloxacillin is stable against hydrolysis by a variety of beta-lactamases, including penicillinases, and cephalosporinases and extended spectrum beta-lactamases.Dicloxacillin exerts a bactericidal action against penicillin-susceptible microorganisms during the state of active multiplication. All penicillins inhibit the biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall. By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, dicloxacillin inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that dicloxacillin interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."
278,"Nabilone is indicated for the treatment of the nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments. This restriction is required because a substantial proportion of any group of patients treated with Nabilone can be expected to experience disturbing psychotomimetic reactions not observed with other antiemetic agents.Nabilone (marketed as Cesamet) is a synthetic form of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ�?THC), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis (marijuana). Although structurally distinct from THC, nabilone mimics THC's structure and pharmacological activity through weak partial agonist activity at Cannabinoid-1 (CB1R) and Cannabinoid-2 (CB2R) receptors, however it is considered to be twice as active as Δ�?THC. Nabilone is approved by the FDA for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments [FDA Label].    Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are the two most abundant cannabinoids found naturally in the resin of the marijuana plant, both of which are pharmacologically active due to their interaction with cannabinoid receptors that are found throughout the body [A32830]. While both CBD and THC are used for medicinal purposes, they have different receptor activity, function, and physiological effects. If not provided in their activated form (such as through synthetic forms like Nabilone or [DB00470]), THC and CBD are obtained through conversion from their precursors, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid-A (THCA-A) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), through decarboxylation reactions. This can be achieved through heating, smoking, vaporization, or baking of dried unfertilized female cannabis flowers.    From a pharmacological perspective, Cannabis' diverse receptor profile explains its potential application for such a wide variety of medical conditions. Cannabis contains more than 400 different chemical compounds, of which 61 are considered cannabinoids, a class of compounds that act upon endogenous cannabinoid receptors of the body [A32584]. The endocannabinoid system is widely distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system (via the Cannabinoid Receptors CB1 and CB2) and plays a role in many physiological processes such as inflammation, cardiovascular function, learning, pain, memory, stress and emotional regulation, and the sleep/wake cycle among many others [A32824]. CB1 receptors are found in both the central and peripheral nervous system, and are most abundant in the hippocampus and amygdala, which are the areas of the brain responsible for short-term memory storage and emotional regulation. CB2 receptors are mainly located in the peripheral nervous system and can be found on lymphoid tissue where they are involved in regulation of immune function [A32676].    In Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and Mexico, nabilone is marketed as Cesamet. It was approved in 1985 by the United States FDA for treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting that has not responded to conventional antiemetics. Though it was approved by the FDA in 1985, the drug only began marketing in the United States in 2006. It is also approved for use in treatment of anorexia and weight loss in patients with AIDS.    Nabilone is a racemate consisting of the (S,S) and the (R,R) isomers.Nabilone is a cannabinoid with therapeutic uses. It is an analog of dronabinol (also known as tetrahydrocannabinol or THC), the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis. Although structurally distinct from THC, nabilone mimics THC's structure and pharmacological activity through weak partial agonist activity at Cannabinoid-1 (CB1R) and Cannabinoid-2 (CB2R) receptors, however it is considered to be twice as active as Δ�?THC. Nabilone is an orally active synthetic cannabinoid which, like other cannabinoids, has complex effects on the central nervous system (CNS). It has been suggested that the antiemetic effect of nabilone is caused by interaction with the cannabinoid receptor system, i.e., the CB (1) receptor, which is a component of the endocannabinoid system of the body.     The endocannabinoid system is widely distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system (via the Cannabinoid Receptors CB1 and CB2) and plays a role in many physiological processes such as inflammation, cardiovascular function, learning, pain, memory, stress and emotional regulation, and the sleep/wake cycle among many others [A32824]. CB1 receptors are found in both the central and peripheral nervous system, and are most abundant in the hippocampus and amygdala, which are the areas of the brain responsible for short-term memory storage and emotional regulation. CB2 receptors are mainly located in the peripheral nervous system and can be found on lymphoid tissue where they are involved in regulation of immune function [A32676]."
279,"For the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in males and for gram-negative-bacterial infections in the gastrointestinal system and the genitourinary tract.A synthetic broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent active against most gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.Pefloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic. Flouroquinolones such as pefloxacin possess excellent activity against gram-negative aerobic bacteria such as E.coli and Neisseria gonorrhoea as well as gram-positive bacteria including S. pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. They also posses effective activity against shigella, salmonella, campylobacter, gonococcal organisms, and multi drug resistant pseudomonas and enterobacter.The bactericidal action of pefloxacin results from interference with the activity of the bacterial enzymes DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, which are needed for the transcription and replication of bacterial DNA. DNA gyrase appears to be the primary quinolone target for gram-negative bacteria. Topoisomerase IV appears to be the preferential target in gram-positive organisms. Interference with these two topoisomerases results in strand breakage of the bacterial chromosome, supercoiling, and resealing. As a result DNA replication and transcription is inhibited."
280,"Indicated for the management of anxiety disorders or the short-term relief of the symptoms of anxiety.[L4478]Buspirone is a novel anxiolytic agent with a unique structure and a pharmacological profile. Belonging to the azaspirodecanedione drug class,[A180991] buspirone is a serotonin 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor agonist that is not chemically or pharmacologically related to benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and other sedative/anxiolytic drugs.[L4478] Unlike many drugs used to treat anxiety, buspirone does not exhibit anticonvulsant, sedative, hypnotic, and muscle-relaxant properties. Due to these characteristics, buspirone been termed 'anxioselective'.[A180985] First synthesized in 1968 then patented in 1975,[L7375] it is commonly marketed under the brand name Buspar®. Buspirone was first approved in 1986 by the FDA [A181751] and has been used to treat anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and relieve symptoms of anxiety. It has also been used as a second-line therapy for unipolar depression when the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is deemed clinically inadequate or inappropriate.[L7375] The potential use of buspirone in combination with [melatonin] in depression and cognitive impairment via promoting neurogenesis has also been investigated.[A181751]The clinical effect of buspirone in alleviating the symptoms of generalized anxiety disorders typically takes 2 to 4 weeks to achieve.[L7375] The delayed onset of action of buspirone suggests that the therapeutic effectiveness in generalized anxiety may involved more than its molecular mechanism of action at the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors,[T28] or buspirone may induce adaptations of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors.[L7375] Buspirone was not shown to alter the psychomotor or cognitive function in healthy volunteers, and the risk of developing sedation is relatively low compared to other anxiolytics, such as benzodiazepines.[A180985] Unlike benzodiazepines and barbiturates used in anxiety disorders, buspirone is not associated with a risk for developing physical dependence or withdrawal, or any significant interaction with central nervous system depressants such as ethanol. This is due to the lack of effects on GABA receptors.[A180985,L7375] Buspirone also does not exhibit any anticonvulsant or muscle-relaxing properties,[A182309] but may interfere with arousal reactions due to its inhibitory action on the aactivity of noradrenergic locus coerulus neurons.[T28]    Despite its clinical effectiveness in generalized anxiety, buspirone demonstrated limited clinical effectiveness on panic disorders, severe anxiety, phobias, and obsessive compulsive disorders.[A181751,T28] The clinical effectiveness of the long-term use of buspirone, for more than 3 to 4 weeks, has not demonstrated in controlled trials but there were no observable significant adverse events in patients receiving buspirone for a year in a study of long-term use.[L4478]The therapeutic action of buspirone in generalized anxiety disorders is thought to be mainly derived from its interaction with two major 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor subtypes that are involved in the brain's anxiety and fear circuitry to enhance the serotonergic activity in these brain areas.[L7375] Buspirone acts as a full agonist at presynaptic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors, or 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> autoreceptors, expressed at dorsal raphe while acting as a partial agonist at the postsynaptic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors expressed on hippocampus and cortex.[A182315,A182420] 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors function as inhibitory autoreceptors by being expressed on the soma or dendrites of serotonergic neurons or mediate postsynaptic actions of 5-HT by being highly expressed on the corticolimbic circuits.[T28] They are inhibitory G-protein coupled receptors that couple to Gi/Go proteins. When activated, presynaptic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> autoreceptors causes neuron hyperpolarization and reduces the firing rate of the serotonergic neuron, thereby decreasing extracellular 5-HT levels in the neuron's projection areas. Activated postsynaptic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors promote hyperpolarization to released 5-HT on pyramidal neurons.[A182420]     The anxiolytic action of buspirone is mainly thought to arise from the interaction at presynaptic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> autoreceptors. Acting as a potent agonist in these receptors, buspirone initially causes activation of these autoreceptors and inhibition of 5-HT release. It is proposed that buspirone induces desensitization of somatodendritic autoreceptors over time, which may explain the delayed onset of action of the drug. Desensitization of the autoreceptors ultimately results in heightened excitation of serotonergic neurons and enhanced 5-HT release.[T28] Buspirone also displays a weak affinity for serotonin 5HT2 receptors and acts as a weak antagonist on dopamine D2 autoreceptors,[L7375] although there is not much evidence that the action at these receptors contribute to the anxiolytic effect of buspirone.[A182312] It acts as an antagonist at presynaptic dopamine D3 and D4 receptors and may bind to alpha-1 adrenergic receptors as a partial agonist.[A181751]"
281,"For use as an adjunct to diet to improve glycemic control in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) whose hyperglycemia cannot be managed with diet alone.Miglitol inhibits the breakdown complex carbohydrates into glucose. It is primarily used in diabetes mellitus type 2 for establishing greater glycemic control by preventing the digestion of carbohydrates (such as disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides) into monosaccharides which can be absorbed by the body.    Miglitol should be taken at the start of a meal for maximal effect and the effect will depend on the amount of poly and oligosaccharides in the diet. Miglitol inhibits alpha-glucosidase, making less sugars available for digestion and reducing postprandial hyperglycemia.    Unlike other drugs of the same class, miglitol is not metabolized and the unmetabolized drug is excreted by the kidneys.Miglitol, an oral alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, is a desoxynojirimycin derivative that delays the digestion of ingested carbohydrates, thereby resulting in a smaller rise in blood glucose concentration following meals. As a consequence of plasma glucose reduction, miglitol reduce levels of glycosylated hemoglobin in patients with Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. Systemic nonenzymatic protein glycosylation, as reflected by levels of glycosylated hemoglobin, is a function of average blood glucose concentration over time. Because its mechanism of action is different, the effect of miglitol to enhance glycemic control is additive to that of sulfonylureas when used in combination. In addition, miglitol diminishes the insulinotropic and weight-increasing effects of sulfonylureas. Miglitol has minor inhibitory activity against lactase and consequently, at the recommended doses, would not be expected to induce lactose intolerance.In contrast to sulfonylureas, miglitol does not enhance insulin secretion. The antihyperglycemic action of miglitol results from a reversible inhibition of membrane-bound intestinal a-glucoside hydrolase enzymes. Membrane-bound intestinal a-glucosidases hydrolyze oligosaccharides and disaccharides to glucose and other monosaccharides in the brush border of the small intestine. In diabetic patients, this enzyme inhibition results in delayed glucose absorption and lowering of postprandial hyperglycemia."
282,"For treating mild to moderate hypertension, use as an adjunct in treating congestive heart failure, and may be used to slow the rate of progression of renal disease in hypertensive individuals with diabetes mellitus and microalbuminuria or overt nephropathy. Fosinopril is a phosphinic acid-containing ester prodrug that belongs to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor class of medications. It is rapidly hydrolyzed to fosinoprilat, its principle active metabolite. Fosinoprilat inhibits ACE, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of angiotensin I (ATI) to angiotensin II (ATII). ATII regulates blood pressure and is a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Fosinopril may be used to treat mild to moderate hypertension, as an adjunct in the treatment of congestive heart failure, and to slow the rate of progression of renal disease in hypertensive individuals with diabetes mellitus and microalbuminuria or overt nephropathy.Following oral administration, fosinopril is rapidly and completely hydrolyzed to its principle active metabolite, fosinoprilat. Hydrolysis is thought to occur in the gastrointestinal mucosa and liver. Fosinoprilat is a competitive inhibitor of ACE, a peptidyl dipeptidase that is part of the RAAS. The RAAS is a homeostatic mechanism for regulating hemodynamics, water and electrolyte balance. During sympathetic stimulation or when renal blood pressure or blood flow is reduced, renin is released from the granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. In the blood stream, renin cleaves circulating angiotensinogen to ATI, which is subsequently cleaved to ATII by ACE. ATII increases blood pressure using a number of mechanisms. First, it stimulates the secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone travels to the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and collecting tubule of nephrons where it increases sodium and water reabsorption by increasing the number of sodium channels and sodium-potassium ATPases on cell membranes. Second, ATII stimulates the secretion of vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone or ADH) from the posterior pituitary gland. ADH stimulates further water reabsorption from the kidneys via insertion of aquaporin-2 channels on the apical surface of cells of the DCT and collecting tubules. Third, ATII increases blood pressure through direct arterial vasoconstriction. Stimulation of the Type 1 ATII receptor on vascular smooth muscle cells leads to a cascade of events resulting in myocyte contraction and vasoconstriction. In addition to these major effects, ATII induces the thirst response via stimulation of hypothalamic neurons. ACE inhibitors inhibit the rapid conversion of ATI to ATII and antagonize RAAS-induced increases in blood pressure. ACE (also known as kininase II) is also involved in the enzymatic deactivation of bradykinin, a vasodilator. Inhibiting the deactivation of bradykinin increases bradykinin levels and may further sustain the effects of fosinoprilat by causing increased vasodilation and decreased blood pressure. There are two isoforms of ACE: the somatic isoform, which exists as a glycoprotein comprised of a single polypeptide chain of 1277; and the testicular isoform, which has a lower molecular mass and is thought to play a role in sperm maturation and binding of sperm to the oviduct epithelium. Somatic ACE has two functionally active domains, N and C, which arise from tandem gene duplication. Although the two domains have high sequence similarity, they play distinct physiological roles. The C-domain is predominantly involved in blood pressure regulation while the N-domain plays a role in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and proliferation. ACE inhibitors bind to and inhibit the activity of both domains, but have much greater affinity for and inhibitory activity against the C-domain. Fosinoprilat, the active metabolite of fosinopril, competes with ATI for binding to ACE and inhibits and enzymatic proteolysis of ATI to ATII. Decreasing ATII levels in the body decreases blood pressure by inhibiting the pressor effects of ATII as described in the Pharmacology section above. Fosinoprilat also causes an increase in plasma renin activity likely due to a loss of feedback inhibition mediated by ATII on the release of renin and/or stimulation of reflex mechanisms via baroreceptors.

Also used before an operation to prevent infection after surgery.Cefotaxime is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic. Like other third-generation cephalosporins, it has broad spectrum activity against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. In most cases, it is considered to be equivalent to ceftriaxone in terms of safety and efficacy. Cefotaxime sodium is marketed under various trade names including Claforan (Sanofi-Aventis).Cefotaxime is a third generation intravenous cephalosporin antibiotic. It has broad spectrum activity against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. It does not have activity against <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. Cefotaxime works by inhibiting bacterial cell wall biosynthesis. A positive feature of cefotaxime is that it display a resistance to penicillinases and is useful to treat infections that are resistant to penicillin derivatives.The bactericidal activity of cefotaxime results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Cefotaxime shows high affinity for penicillin-binding proteins in the cell wall including PBP Ib and PBP III."

When administered concomittantly with levodopa and a decarboxylase inhibitor (e.g., carbidopa), increased and more sustained plasma levodopa concentrations are reached as compared to the administration of levodopa and a decarboxylase inhibitor.Entacapone is structurally and pharmacologically related to tolcapone, but unlike tolcapone, is not associated with hepatotoxicity. Entacapone is used in the treatment of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease as an adjunct to levodopa/carbidopa therapy. Entacapone selectively and reversiblly inhibits catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). In mammals, COMT is distributed throughout various organs with the highest activities in the liver and kidney. COMT also occurs in the heart, lung, smooth and skeletal muscles, intestinal tract, reproductive organs, various glands, adipose tissue, skin, blood cells and neuronal tissues, especially in glial cells. COMT catalyzes the transfer of the methyl group of S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the phenolic group of substrates that contain a catechol structure. Physiological substrates of COMT include dopa, catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine) and their hydroxylated metabolites. The function of COMT is the elimination of biologically active catechols and some other hydroxylated metabolites. COMT is responsible for the elimination of biologically active catechols and some other hydroxylated metabolites. In the presence of a decarboxylase inhibitor, COMT becomes the major metabolizing enzyme for levodopa, catalyzing the it to 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-L-phenylalanine (3-OMD) in the brain and periphery.The mechanism of action of entacapone is believed to be through its ability to inhibit COMT in peripheral tissues, altering the plasma pharmacokinetics of levodopa. When entacapone is given in conjunction with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbidopa, plasma levels of levodopa are greater and more sustained than after administration of levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor alone. It is believed that at a given frequency of levodopa administration, these more sustained plasma levels of levodopa result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, leading to a greater reduction in the manifestations of parkinsonian syndrome."
285,"Used in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of human immunovirus (HIV) infections.A dideoxynucleoside compound in which the 3&#39;-hydroxy group on the sugar moiety has been replaced by an azido group. This modification prevents the formation of phosphodiester linkages which are needed for the completion of nucleic acid chains. The compound is a potent inhibitor of HIV replication, acting as a chain-terminator of viral DNA during reverse transcription. It improves immunologic function, partially reverses the HIV-induced neurological dysfunction, and improves certain other clinical abnormalities associated with AIDS. Its principal toxic effect is dose-dependent suppression of bone marrow, resulting in anemia and leukopenia. [PubChem]Zidovudine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) with activity against Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1). Zidovudine is phosphorylated to active metabolites that compete for incorporation into viral DNA. They inhibit the HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme competitively and act as a chain terminator of DNA synthesis. The lack of a 3'-OH group in the incorporated nucleoside analogue prevents the formation of the 5' to 3' phosphodiester linkage essential for DNA chain elongation, and therefore, the viral DNA growth is terminated.Zidovudine, a structural analog of thymidine, is a prodrug that must be phosphorylated to its active 5�?triphosphate metabolite, zidovudine triphosphate (ZDV-TP). It inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) via DNA chain termination after incorporation of the nucleotide analogue. It competes with the natural substrate dGTP and incorporates itself into viral DNA. It is also a weak inhibitor of cellular DNA polymerase α and γ.  "
286,"For the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency and frequency.Darifenacin (Enablex®, Novartis) is a medication used to treat urinary incontinence.    Darifenacin blocks M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, which mediate bladder muscle contractions. This block reduces the urgency to urinate and so it should not be used in people with urinary retention.    It is unknown if M3 receptor selectivity is clinically advantageous in overactive bladder syndrome treatments.Darifenacin is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. <i>In vitro</i> studies using human recombinant muscarinic receptor subtypes show that darifenacin has greater affinity for the M3 receptor than for the other known muscarinic receptors (9 and 12-fold greater affinity for M3 compared to M1 and M5, respectively, and 59-fold greater affinity for M3 compared to both M2 and M4). Muscarinic receptors play an important role in several major cholinergically mediated functions, including contractions of the urinary bladder smooth muscle and stimulation of salivary secretion. Adverse drug effects such as dry mouth, constipation and abnormal vision may be mediated through effects on M3 receptors in these organs.Darifenacin selectively antagonizes the muscarinic M3 receptor. M3 receptors are involved in contraction of human bladder and gastrointestinal smooth muscle, saliva production, and iris sphincter function."
287,"Oxycodone is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe pain.[Label] There is also an extended release formulation indicated for chronic moderate to severe pain requiring continuous opioid analgesics for an extended period.[Label]Oxycodone is a semisynthetic opioid analgesic derived from thebaine in Germany in 1917.[A178696] It is currently indicated as an immediate release product for moderate to severe pain and as an extended release product for chronic moderate to severe pain requiring continuous opioid analgesics for an extended period.[Label] The first oxycodone containing product, Percodan, was approved by the FDA on April 12, 1950.[L6460]Oxycodone acts directly on a number of tissues not related to its analgesic effect. These tissues include the respiratory centre in the brain stem, the cough centre in the medulla, muscles of the pupils, gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular system, endocrine system, and immune system.[Label] Oxycodone's effect on the respiratory centre is dose dependant respiratory depression.[Label] The action on the cough centre is suppression of the cough reflex.[Label] Pupils become miopic or decrease in size, peristalsis of the gastrointestinal tract slows, and muscle tone in the colon may increase causing constipation.[Label] In the cardiovascular system histamine may be released leading to pruritis, red eyes, flushing, sweating, and decreased blood pressure.[Label] Endocrine effects may include increased prolactin, decreased cortisol, and decreased testosterone.[Label] It is not yet known if the effects of opioids on the immune system are clinically significant.[Label]The full mechanism of oxycodone is not known.[Label] Under conditions of inflammation or hyperalgesia, opioid receptors in the heart, lungs, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and reproductive system are upregulated and transported to nerve terminals.[A178696] Oxycodone and its active metabolites, noroxycodone, oxymorphone, and noroxymorphone are opioid agonists.[A178639] These compounds passively diffuse across the blood brain barrier or may be actively transported across by an unknown mechanism.[A178696] Oxycodone and its active metabolites can selectively bind to the mu opioid receptor, but also the kappa and delta opioid receptors in the central nervous system and periphery, and induce a G protein coupled receptor signalling pathway.[A178696] Activation of mu opioid receptors inhibits N-type voltage operated calcium channels, inhibiting responses to pain.[A178735]"
288,"For the treatment of pulmonary embolism, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation and flutter, cerebral embolism, mural thrombosis, and thrombophili. Also used for anticoagulant prophylaxis.An indandione that has been used as an anticoagulant. Phenindione has actions similar to warfarin, but it is now rarely employed because of its higher incidence of severe adverse effects. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p234)Phenindione thins the blood by antagonizing vitamin K which is required for the production of clotting factors in the liver. Anticoagulants such as Phenindione have no direct effect on an established thrombus, nor do they reverse ischemic tissue damage (damage caused by an inadequate blood supply to an organ or part of the body). However, once a thrombus has occurred, the goal of anticoagulant treatment is to prevent further extension of the formed clot and prevent secondary thromboembolic complications which may result in serious and possibly fatal sequelae. Phenindione has actions similar to warfarin, but it is now rarely employed because of its higer incidence of severe adverse effects.Phenindione inhibits vitamin K reductase, resulting in depletion of the reduced form of vitamin K (vitamin KH2). As vitamin K is a cofactor for the carboxylation of glutamate residues on the N-terminal regions of vitamin K-dependent proteins, this limits the gamma-carboxylation and subsequent activation of the vitamin K-dependent coagulant proteins. The synthesis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X and anticoagulant proteins C and S is inhibited. Depression of three of the four vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors (factors II, VII, and X) results in decreased prothrombin levels and a decrease in the amount of thrombin generated and bound to fibrin. This reduces the thrombogenicity of clots."
289,"For the management of locally confined Stage B2-C and Stage D2 metastatic carcinoma of the prostateAn antiandrogen with about the same potency as cyproterone in rodent and canine species.Flutamide is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen. In animal studies, flutamide demonstrates potent antiandrogenic effects. It exerts its antiandrogenic action by inhibiting androgen uptake and/or by inhibiting nuclear binding of androgen in target tissues or both. Prostatic carcinoma is known to be androgen-sensitive and responds to treatment that counteracts the effect of androgen and/or removes the source of androgen, e.g. castration. Elevations of plasma testosterone and estradiol levels have been noted following flutamide administration.Flutamide is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen that blocks the action of both endogenous and exogenous testosterone by binding to the androgen receptor. In addition Flutamide is a potent inhibitor of testosterone-stimulated prostatic DNA synthesis. Moreover, it is capable of inhibiting prostatic nuclear uptake of androgen."
290,"Cimetidine is indicated to reduce gastric acid secretion and to treat the following disease states: duodenal ulcers, non-malignant gastric ulcers, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and pathological hypersecretion associated with Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, systemic mastocytosis, and multiple endocrine adenomas.[L30280] It is indicated for prophylaxis of recurrent gastric or duodenal ulcers, as adjunctive therapy in the management of cystic fibrosis in children, and to treat NSAID induced lesions and gastrointestinal symptoms.[L30280]A histamine congener, it competitively inhibits histamine binding to histamine H2 receptors. Cimetidine has a range of pharmacological actions. It inhibits gastric acid secretion, as well as pepsin and gastrins output. It also blocks the activity of cytochrome P-450 which might explain proposals for use in neoadjuvant therapy.Cimetidine is a histamine H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonist. It reduces basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion and a reduction in gastric volume, acidity, and amount of gastric acid released in response to stimuli including food, caffeine, insulin, betazole, or pentagastrin. It is used to treat gastrointestinal disorders such as gastric or duodenal ulcer, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and pathological hypersecretory conditions. Cimetidine inhibits many of the isoenzymes of the hepatic CYP450 enzyme system. Other actions of Cimetidine include an increase in gastric bacterial flora such as nitrate-reducing organisms.Cimetidine binds to an H<sub>2</sub>-receptor located on the basolateral membrane of the gastric parietal cell, blocking histamine effects. This competitive inhibition results in reduced gastric acid secretion and a reduction in gastric volume and acidity."
291,"Haloperidol is indicated for a number of conditions including for the treatment of schizophrenia, for the manifestations of psychotic disorders, for the control of tics and vocal utterances of Tourette’s Disorder in children and adults, for treatment of severe behavior problems in children of combative, explosive hyperexcitability (which cannot be accounted for by immediate provocation). Haloperidol is also indicated in the short-term treatment of hyperactive children who show excessive motor activity with accompanying conduct disorders consisting of some or all of the following symptoms: impulsivity, difficulty sustaining attention, aggressivity, mood lability, and poor frustration tolerance. Haloperidol should be reserved for these two groups of children only after failure to respond to psychotherapy or medications other than antipsychotics.[F4645]Haloperidol is a high potency first-generation (typical) antipsychotic and one of the most frequently used antipsychotic medications used worldwide.[A180616] While haloperidol has demonstrated pharmacologic activity at a number of receptors in the brain,[A27477] it exerts its antipsychotic effect through its strong antagonism of the dopamine receptor (mainly D2), particularly within the mesolimbic and mesocortical systems of the brain. Haloperidol is indicated for the treatment of the manifestations of several psychotic disorders including schizophrenia, acute psychosis, Tourette syndrome, and other severe behavioural states.[F4645] It is also used off-label for the management of chorea associated with Huntington's disease and for the treatment of intractable hiccups as it is a potent antiemetic. Dopamine-antagonizing medications such as haloperidol are though to improve psychotic symptoms and states that are caused by an over-production of dopamine, such as schizophrenia, which is theorized to be caused by a hyperdopaminergic state within the limbic system of the brain.[A34360]    Use of the first-generation antipsychotics (including haloperidol) is considered highly effective for the management of the ""positive"" symptoms of schizophrenia including hallucinations, hearing voices, aggression/hostility, disorganized speech, and psychomotor agitation. However, this class of drugs is also limited by the development of movement disorders induced by dopamine-blockade such as drug-induced parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia, tardive dyskinesia, as well as other side effects including sedation, weight gain, and prolactin changes. While there are limited high-quality studies comparing haloperidol to lower-potency first-generation antipsychotics such as [DB00477], [DB01624], [DB00623], and [DB01403], haloperidol typically demonstrates the least amount of side effects within this class, but demonstrates a stronger disposition for causing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).[A180613, A180616, A180625] These other low‐potency antipsychotics are limited by their lower affinity for dopamine receptors, which requires a higher dose to effectively treat symptoms of schizophrenia. In addition, they block many receptors other than the primary target (dopamine receptors), such as cholinergic or histaminergic receptors, resulting in a higher incidence of side effects such as sedation, weight gain, and hypotension.    Interestingly, in vivo pharmacogenetic studies have demonstrated that the metabolism of haloperidol may be modulated by genetically determined polymorphic _CYP2D6_ activity. However, these findings contradict the findings from studies in vitro with human liver microsomes and from drug interaction studies in vivo. Inter-ethnic and pharmacogenetic differences in haloperidol metabolism may possibly explain these observations.[A32346]    First-generation antipsychotic drugs have largely been replaced with second- and third-generation (atypical) antipsychotics such as [DB00734], [DB00334], [DB00363], [DB01224], [DB01238], and [DB00246]. However, haloperidol use remains widespread and is considered the benchmark for comparison in trials of the newer generation antipsychotics.[A180625]    The efficacy of haloperidol was first established in controlled trials in the 1960s.[A180610]Use of the first-generation antipsychotics (including haloperidol) is considered highly effective for the management of the ""positive"" symptoms of schizophrenia including hallucinations, hearing voices, aggression/hostility, disorganized speech, and psychomotor agitation. However, this class is limited by the development of movement disorders such as drug-induced parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia, and tardive dyskinesia, and other side effects including sedation, weight gain, and prolactin changes. Compared to the lower-potency first-generation antipsychotics such as [DB00477], [DB01624], [DB00623], and [DB01403], haloperidol typically demonstrates the least amount of side effects within class, but demonstrates a stronger disposition for causing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).[A180613, A180616, A180625] Low‐potency medications have a lower affinity for dopamine receptors so that a higher dose is required to effectively treat symptoms of schizophrenia. In addition, they block many receptors other than the primary target (dopamine receptors), such as cholinergic or histaminergic receptors, resulting in a higher incidence of side effects such as sedation, weight gain, and hypotension.    The balance between the wanted drug effects on psychotic symptoms and unwanted side effects are largely at play within dopaminergic brain pathways affected by haloperidol. Cortical dopamine-D2-pathways play an important role in regulating these effects and include the nigrostriatal pathway, which is responsible for causing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways, which are responsible for the improvement in positive schizophrenic symptoms, and the tuberoinfundibular dopamine pathway, which is responsible for hyperprolactinemia.     A syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome.[F4645]    Cases of sudden death, QT-prolongation, and Torsades de Pointes have been reported in patients receiving haloperidol. Higher than recommended doses of any formulation and intravenous administration of haloperidol appear to be associated with a higher risk of QT-prolongation and Torsades de Pointes. Although cases have been reported even in the absence of predisposing factors, particular caution is advised in treating patients with other QT-prolonging conditions (including electrolyte imbalance [particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia], drugs known to prolong QT, underlying cardiac abnormalities, hypothyroidism, and familial long QT-syndrome).[F4645]    A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status (including catatonic signs) and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute renal failure.[F4645]While haloperidol has demonstrated pharmacologic activity at a number of receptors in the brain, it exerts its antipsychotic effect through its strong antagonism of the dopamine receptor (mainly D2), particularly within the mesolimbic and mesocortical systems of the brain. Schizophrenia is theorized to be caused by a hyperdopaminergic state within the limbic system of the brain.[A34360] Dopamine-antagonizing medications such as haloperidol, therefore, are thought to improve psychotic symptoms by halting this over-production of dopamine. The optimal clinical efficacy of antipsychotics is associated with the blockade of approximately 60 % - 80 % of D2 receptors in the brain.[A34360]    While the exact mechanism is not entirely understood, haloperidol is known to inhibit the effects of dopamine and increase its turnover. Traditional antipsychotics, such as haloperidol, bind more tightly than dopamine itself to the dopamine D2 receptor, with dissociation constants that are lower than that for dopamine.[A4962] It is believed that haloperidol competitively blocks post-synaptic dopamine (D2) receptors in the brain, eliminating dopamine neurotransmission and leading to the relief of delusions and hallucinations that are commonly associated with psychosis. It acts primarily on the D2-receptors and has some effect on 5-HT2 and α1-receptors, with negligible effects on dopamine  D1-receptors. The drug also exerts some blockade of α-adrenergic receptors of the autonomic system.[L2022]    Antagonistic activity regulated through dopamine D2 receptors in the chemoreceptive trigger zone (CTZ) of the brain renders its antiemetic activity. Of the three D2-like receptors, only the D2 receptor is blocked by antipsychotic drugs in direct relation to their clinical antipsychotic abilities.     Clinical brain-imaging findings show that haloperidol remains tightly bound to D2 dopamine receptors in humans undergoing 2 positron emission tomography (PET) scans with a 24h pause in between scans.[A4962] A common adverse effect of this drug is the development of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), due to this tight binding of haloperidol to the dopamine D2 receptor.    Due to the risk of unpleasant and sometimes lifelong extrapyramidal symptoms, newer antipsychotic medications than haloperidol have been discovered and formulated. Rapid dissociation of drugs from dopamine D2 receptors is a plausible explanation for the improved EPS profile of atypical antipsychotics such as [DB00734]. This is also consistent with the theory of a lower affinity for D2 receptors for these drugs.  As mentioned above, haloperidol binds tightly to the dopamine receptor, potentiating the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms,[A4962] and therefore should only been used when necessary."
292,"[L46586, L39840] In Europe, this therapeutic indication is approved under conditional marketing authorization.[L40089]Ritonavir is an HIV protease inhibitor that interferes with the reproductive cycle of HIV. It is now more commonly used as a booster of other protease inhibitors and is available in both liquid formulations and as capsules.     While ritonavir is not an active antiviral agent against hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, it is added in combination therapies indicated for the treatment of HCV infections as a booster. Ritonavir is a potent CYP3A inhibitor that increases peak and trough plasma drug concentrations of other protease inhibitors such as [DB09297] and overall drug exposure. American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines recommend ritonavir-boosted combination therapies as first-line therapy for HCV Genotype 1a/b and 4 treatment-naïve patients with or without cirrhosis.     Ritonavir is found in a fixed-dose combination product with [DB09296], [DB09183], and [DB09297] as the FDA-approved product Viekira Pak. First approved in December 2014, Viekira Pak is indicated for the treatment of HCV genotype 1b without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis, and when combined with Ribavirin for the treatment of HCV genotype 1a without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis.    Ritonavir is also available as a fixed-dose combination product with [DB09296] and [DB09297] as the FDA- and Health Canada-approved product Technivie. First approved in July 2015, Technivie is indicated in combination with Ribavirin for the treatment of patients with genotype 4 chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis.    In Canada, ritonavir is also available as a fixed-dose combination product with [DB09296], [DB09183], and [DB09297] as the Health Canada-approved, commercially available product Holkira Pak. First approved in January 2015, Holkira Pak is indicated for the treatment of HCV genotype 1b with or without cirrhosis, and when combined with Ribavirin for the treatment of HCV genotype 1a with or without cirrhosis. The inclusion of ritonavir can select for HIV-1 protease inhibitor resistance-associated substitutions. Any HCV/HIV-1 co-infected patients treated with ritonavir-containing combination therapies should also be on a suppressive antiretroviral drug regimen to reduce the risk of HIV-1 protease inhibitor drug resistance.    Ritonavir is combined with other drugs to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients at risk for progressing into a severe form of the disease, such as [nirmatrelvir].[L40094]Ritonavir is a protease inhibitor with activity against Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1). Protease inhibitors block the part of HIV called protease. HIV-1 protease is an enzyme required for the proteolytic cleavage of the viral polyprotein precursors into the individual functional proteins found in infectious HIV-1. Ritonavir binds to the protease active site and inhibits the activity of the enzyme. This inhibition prevents cleavage of the viral polyproteins resulting in the formation of immature non-infectious viral particles. Protease inhibitors are almost always used in combination with at least two other anti-HIV drugs. Modern protease inhibitors require the use of low-dose ritonavir to boost pharmacokinetic exposure through inhibition of metabolism via the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme pathway. Ritonavic inhibits the HIV viral proteinase enzyme that normally cleaves the structural and replicative proteins that arise from major HIV genes, such as *gag* and *pol*. *Gag* encodes proteins involved in the core and the nucleocapsid, while *pol* encodes the the HIV reverse transcriptase, ribonuclease H, integrase, and protease [A19647]. The *pol*-encoded proteins are initially translated in the form of a larger precursoe polypeptide, *gag-pol*, and needs to be cleaved by HIV protease to form other complement proteins [A19647]. Ritonavir prevents the cleavage of the *gag-pol* polyprotein, which results in noninfectious, immature viral particles. Ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 isoenzyme present both in the intestinal tract and liver [A19647]. It is a type II ligand that perfectly fits into the CYP3A4 active site cavity and irreversibly binds to the heme iron via the thiazole nitrogen, which decreases the redox potential of the protein and precludes its reduction with the redox partner, cytochrome P450 reductase [A19648]. Ritonavir may also play a role in limiting cellular transport and efflux of other protease inhibitors via the P-glycoprotein and MRP efflux channels [A19647]."
293,"Used mainly in the management of psychoses. Also used to control nausea and vomiting.A phenothiazine used as an antipsychotic agent and as an antiemetic.Triflupromazine is a member of a class of drugs called phenthiazines, which are dopamine D1/D2 receptor antagonists. Phenothiazines are used to treat serious mental and emotional disorders, including schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. It reduces anxiety, emotional withdrawal, hallucinations, disorganized thoughts, blunted mood, and suspiciousness. Triflupromazine is used particularly to control violent behavior during acute episodes of psychotic disorders. It can also be used to control severe nausea and vomiting, severe hiccups, and moderate to severe pain in some hospitalized patients. Triflupromazine acts on the central nervous system.Triflupromazine binds to the dopamine D1 and dopamine D2 receptors and inhibits their activity. The mechanism of the anti-emetic effect is due predominantly to blockage of the dopamine D2 neurotransmitter receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) and vomiting centre. Triflupromazine blocks the neurotransmitter dopamine and the vagus nerve in the gastrointestinal tract. Triflupromazine also binds the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M1 and M2) and the tryptamine D receptors (5HT<sub>2B</sub>)."
294,"Used for fast digitalization in congestive heart failure.Cardioactive derivative of lanatoside A or of digitoxin used for fast digitalization in congestive heart failure.The main pharmacological effects of acetyldigitoxin are on the heart. Extracardiac effects are responsible for many of the adverse effects. Its main cardiac effects are 1) a decrease of conduction of electrical impulses through the AV node, making it a commonly used drug in controlling the heart rate during atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, and 2) an increase of force of contraction via inhibition of the Na+/K+ ATPase pump.Acetyldigitoxin binds to a site on the extracellular aspect of the &alpha;-subunit of the Na+/K+ATPase pump in the membranes of heart cells (myocytes). This causes an increase in the level of sodium ions in the myocytes, which then leads to a rise in the level of calcium ions. The proposed mechanism is the following: inhibition of the Na+/K+ pump leads to increased Na+levels, which in turn slows down the extrusion of Ca+ via the Na+/Ca2+exchange pump. Increased amounts of Ca2+ are then stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and released by each action potential, which is unchanged by acetyldigitoxin. This is a different mechanism from that of catecholamines. Acetyldigitoxin also increases vagal activity via its central action on the central nervous system, thus decreasing the conduction of electrical impulses through the AV node. This is important for its clinical use in different arrhythmias."
295,"Administered intravenously, vancomycin is indicated in adult and pediatric patients for the treatment of septicemia, infective endocarditis, skin and skin structure infections, bone infections, and lower respiratory tract infections.[L41529] Administered orally, vancomycin is indicated in adult and pediatric patients for the treatment of _Clostridium difficile_-associated diarrhea and for enterocolitis caused by _Staphylococcus aureus_ (including methicillin-resistant strains).[L41534]Antibacterial obtained from Streptomyces orientalis. It is a glycopeptide related to ristocetin that inhibits bacterial cell wall assembly and is toxic to kidneys and the inner ear.    As of January 29 2018, CutisPharma's Firvanq is the only FDA approved vancomycin oral liquid treatment option available for the the treatment of _Clostridium difficile_ associated diarrhea and enterocolitis caused by _Staphylococcus aureus_, including methicillin-resistant strains [LP1196]. Such an oral liquid formulation is expected to make _Clostridium difficile_ associated diarrhea therapy more accessible in comparison to previously available specialty compounding products [LP1196].Vancomycin is a branched tricyclic glycosylated nonribosomal peptide often reserved as the ""drug of last resort"", used only after treatment with other antibiotics has failed. Vancomycin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections: <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>, <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i>, <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> (including penicillin-resistant strains), <i>Streptococcus agalactiae</i>, <i>Actinomyces</i> species, and <i>Lactobacillus</i> species. The combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside acts synergistically in vitro against many strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus bovis, enterococci, and the viridans group streptococci [FDA Label].The bactericidal action of vancomycin results primarily from inhibition of cell-wall biosynthesis. Specifically, vancomycin prevents incorporation of N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM)- and N-acetylglucosamine (NAG)-peptide subunits from being incorporated into the peptidoglycan matrix, which forms the major structural component of Gram-positive cell walls. Vancomycin forms hydrogen bonds with the terminal D-alanyl-D-alanine moieties of the NAM/NAG-peptides, preventing the incorporation of the NAM/NAG-peptide subunits into the peptidoglycan matrix. In addition, vancomycin alters bacterial-cell-membrane permeability and RNA synthesis. There is no cross-resistance between vancomycin and other antibiotics. Vancomycin is not active in vitro against gram-negative bacilli, mycobacteria, or fungi. [FDA Label]                                                                                                                      "
296,"For use in the treatment of excessive postoperative bleeding.An antifibrinolytic agent that acts by inhibiting plasminogen activators which have fibrinolytic properties.Aminocaproic acid works as an antifibrinolytic. It is a derivative of the amino acid lysine. The fibrinolysis-inhibitory effects of aminocaproic acid appear to be exerted principally via inhibition of plasminogen activators and to a lesser degree through antiplasmin activity. Aminocaproic acid may be a possible prophylactic for vascular disease, as it may prevent formation of lipoprotein (a), a risk factor for vascular disease. Aminocaproic acid binds reversibly to the kringle domain of plasminogen and blocks the binding of plasminogen to fibrin and its activation to plasmin. With NO activation of plasmin, there is a reduction in fibrinolysis. This consequently will reduce the amount of bleeding post surgery. Elevated plasma levels of lipoprotein(a) have been shown to increase the risk of vascular disease. Lipoprotein 9a)a has two components, apolipoprotein B-100, linked to apolipoprotein (a). Aminocaproic acid may change the conformation of apoliprotein (a), changing its binding properties and potentially preventing the formation of lipoprotein (a)."

298,"For the treatment of metastatic testicular tumors, metastatic ovarian tumors and advanced bladder cancer.Cisplatin, cisplatinum or cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (CDDP) is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug used to treat various types of cancers, including sarcomas, some carcinomas (e.g. small cell lung cancer, and ovarian cancer), lymphomas and germ cell tumors. It was the first member of its class, which now also includes carboplatin and oxaliplatin.Cisplatin is an antineoplastic in the class of alkylating agents and is used to treat various forms of cancer. Alkylating agents are so named because of their ability to add alkyl groups to many electronegative groups under conditions present in cells. They stop tumor growth by cross-linking guanine bases in DNA double-helix strands - directly attacking DNA. This makes the strands unable to uncoil and separate. As this is necessary in DNA replication, the cells can no longer divide. In addition, these drugs add methyl or other alkyl groups onto molecules where they do not belong which in turn inhibits their correct utilization by base pairing and causes a miscoding of DNA. Alkylating agents are cell cycle-nonspecific. Alkylating agents work by three different mechanisms all of which achieve the same end result - disruption of DNA function and cell death.Alkylating agents work by three different mechanisms: 1) attachment of alkyl groups to DNA bases, resulting in the DNA being fragmented by repair enzymes in their attempts to replace the alkylated bases, preventing DNA synthesis and RNA transcription from the affected DNA, 2) DNA damage via the formation of cross-links (bonds between atoms in the DNA) which prevents DNA from being separated for synthesis or transcription, and 3) the induction of mispairing of the nucleotides leading to mutations."
299,"For use in conjunction with antacids or histamine H2-receptor antagonists in the treatment of peptic ulcer, to reduce further gastric acid secretion and delay gastric emptying.Anisotropine methylbromide is a quaternary ammonium compound. Its use as treatment adjunct in peptic ulcer has been replaced by the use of more effective agents. Depending on the dose, anisotropine methylbromide may reduce the motility and secretory activity of the gastrointestinal system, and the tone of the ureter and urinary bladder and may have a slight relaxant action on the bile ducts and gallbladder. In general, smaller doses of anisotropine methylbromide inhibit salivary and bronchial secretions, sweating, and accommodation; cause dilatation of the pupil; and increase the heart rate. Larger doses are required to decrease motility of the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts and to inhibit gastric acid secretion.Anisotropine methylbromide is a quaternary ammonium compound.

300,"For the treatment of parenchymal neurocysticercosis due to active lesions caused by larval forms of the pork tapeworm, <i>Taenia solium</i> and for the treatment of cystic hydatid disease of the liver, lung, and peritoneum, caused by the larval form of the dog tapeworm, <i>Echinococcus granulosus</i>.A benzimidazole broad-spectrum anthelmintic structurally related to mebendazole that is effective against many diseases. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p38)Albendazole is a broad-spectrum anthelmintic. The principal mode of action for albendazole is by its inhibitory effect on tubulin polymerization which results in the loss of cytoplasmic microtubules.Albendazole causes degenerative alterations in the tegument and intestinal cells of the worm by diminishing its energy production, ultimately leading to immobilization and death of the parasite. It works by binding to the colchicine-sensitive site of tubulin, thus inhibiting its polymerization or assembly into microtubules. As cytoplasmic microtubules are critical in promoting glucose uptake in larval and adult stages of the susceptible parasites, the glycogen stores of the parasites are depleted. Degenerative changes in the endoplasmic reticulum, the mitochondria of the germinal layer, and the subsequent release of lysosomes result in decreased production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the energy required for the survival of the helminth. "
301,"For the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, as an adjunct in the treatment of congestive heart failure (CHF), to improve survival following myocardial infarction (MI) in individuals who are hemodynamically stable and demonstrate symptoms of left ventricular systolic dysfunction or signs of CHF within a few days following acute MI, and to slow progression of renal disease in hypertensive patients with diabetes mellitus and microalbuminuria or overt nephropathy. Trandolapril is a non-sulhydryl prodrug that belongs to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor class of medications. It is metabolized to its biologically active diacid form, trandolaprilat, in the liver. Trandolaprilat inhibits ACE, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of angiotensin I (ATI) to angiotensin II (ATII). ATII regulates blood pressure and is a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Trandolapril may be used to treat mild to moderate hypertension, to improve survival following myocardial infarction in clinically stable patients with left ventricular dysfunction, as an adjunct treatment for congestive heart failure, and to slow the rate of progression of renal disease in hypertensive individuals with diabetes mellitus and microalbuminuria or overt nephropathy.Trandolapril is the ethyl ester prodrug of a nonsulfhydryl ACE inhibitor, trandolaprilat. Trandolapril is deesterified in the liver to the diacid metabolite, trandolaprilat, which is approximately eight times more active as an inhibitor of ACE than its parent compound. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that is part of the RAAS. The RAAS is a homeostatic mechanism for regulating hemodynamics, water and electrolyte balance. During sympathetic stimulation or when renal blood pressure or blood flow is reduced, renin is released from the granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. In the blood stream, renin cleaves circulating angiotensinogen to ATI, which is subsequently cleaved to ATII by ACE. ATII increases blood pressure via a number of mechanisms. First, it stimulates the secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone travels to the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and collecting tubule of nephrons where it increases sodium and water reabsorption by increasing the number of sodium channels and sodium-potassium ATPases on cell membranes. Second, ATII stimulates the secretion of vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone or ADH) from the posterior pituitary gland. ADH stimulates further water reabsorption from the kidneys via insertion of aquaporin-2 channels on the apical surface of cells of the DCT and collecting tubules. Third, ATII increases blood pressure through direct arterial vasoconstriction. Stimulation of the Type 1 ATII receptor on vascular smooth muscle cells leads to a cascade of events resulting in myocyte contraction and vasoconstriction. In addition to these major effects, ATII induces the thirst response via stimulation of hypothalamic neurons. ACE inhibitors inhibit the rapid conversion of ATI to ATII and antagonize RAAS-induced increases in blood pressure. ACE (also known as kininase II) is also involved in the enzymatic deactivation of bradykinin, a vasodilator. Inhibiting the deactivation of bradykinin increases bradykinin levels and may further sustain the effects of trandolaprilat by causing increased vasodilation and decreased blood pressure. The blood pressure lowering effect of trandolaprilat is due to a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance, which is not accompanied by significant changes in urinary excretion of chloride or potassium or water or sodium retention. There are two isoforms of ACE: the somatic isoform, which exists as a glycoprotein comprised of a single polypeptide chain of 1277; and the testicular isoform, which has a lower molecular mass and is thought to play a role in sperm maturation and binding of sperm to the oviduct epithelium. Somatic ACE has two functionally active domains, N and C, which arise from tandem gene duplication. Although the two domains have high sequence similarity, they play distinct physiological roles. The C-domain is predominantly involved in blood pressure regulation while the N-domain plays a role in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and proliferation. ACE inhibitors bind to and inhibit the activity of both domains, but have much greater affinity for and inhibitory activity against the C-domain. Trandolaprilat, the active metabolite of trandolapril, competes with ATI for binding to ACE and inhibits and enzymatic proteolysis of ATI to ATII. Decreasing ATII levels in the body decreases blood pressure by inhibiting the pressor effects of ATII as described in the Pharmacology section above. Trandolaprilat also causes an increase in plasma renin activity likely due to a loss of feedback inhibition mediated by ATII on the release of renin and/or stimulation of reflex mechanisms via baroreceptors.

302,"For the treatment of esophageal candidiasis and invasive aspergillosis in patients who are refractory to or intolerant of other therapies.Caspofungin (brand name Cancidas worldwide) is an antifungal drug and the first member of a new drug class called the echinocandins, as coined by Merck & Co., Inc. It is typically administered intravenously. It shows activity against infections with Aspergillus and Candida, and works by inhibiting β(1,3)-D-Glucan of the fungal cell wall.Caspofungin is an antifungal drug, and belongs to a new class termed the echinocandins. It is used to treat <i>Aspergillus</i> and <i>Candida</i> infection, and works by inhibiting cell wall synthesis. Antifungals in the echinocandin class inhibit the synthesis of glucan in the cell wall, probably via the enzyme 1,3-beta glucan synthase. There is a potential for resistance development to occur, however <i>in vitro</i> resistance development to Caspofungin by Aspergillus species has not been studied.Caspofungin inhibits the synthesis of beta-(1,3)-D-glucan, an essential component of the cell wall of <i>Aspergillus</i> species and <i>Candida</i> species. beta-(1,3)-D-glucan is not present in mammalian cells. The primary target is beta-(1,3)-glucan synthase."
303,"For the treatment of intraocular hypertension and chronic open-angle glaucomaA beta-adrenergic antagonist used as an anti-arrhythmia agent, an anti-angina agent, an antihypertensive agent, and an antiglaucoma agent.Carteolol is a beta1 and beta2 (non-selective) adrenergic receptor-blocking agent that does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct myocardial depressant, or local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) activity. Carteolol, when applied topically to the eye, has the action of reducing elevated, as well as normal, intraocular pressure, whether or not accompanied by glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of glaucomatous visual field loss and optic nerve damage. Carteolol reduces intraocular pressure with little or no effect on pupil size or accommodation in contrast to the miosis which cholinergic agents are known to produce.The primary mechanism of the ocular hypotensive action of carteolol in reducing intraocular pressure is most likely a decrease in aqueous humor production. This process is initiated by the non-selective beta1 and beta2 adrenergic receptor blockade."
304,"For topical treatment of cutaneous lesions in patients with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma.An important regulator of gene expression during growth and development, and in neoplasms. Tretinoin, also known as retinoic acid and derived from maternal vitamin A, is essential for normal growth; and embryonic development. An excess of tretinoin can be teratogenic. It is used in the treatment of psoriasis; acne vulgaris; and several other skin diseases. It has also been approved for use in promyelocytic leukemia (leukemia, promyelocytic, acute).Alitretinoin (9-<i>cis</i>-retinoic acid) is a naturally-occurring endogenous retinoid indicated for topical treatment of cutaneous lesions in patients with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. Alitretinoin inhibits the growth of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) cells <i>in vitro</i>.Alitretinoin binds to and activates all known intracellular retinoid receptor subtypes (RARa, RARb, RARg, RXRa, RXRb and RXRg). Once activated these receptors function as transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes that control the process of cellular differentiation and proliferation in both normal and neoplastic cells."
305,"A quinazoline-sulfonamide that is considered a thiazide-like diuretic which is long-acting so useful in chronic renal failure. It also tends to lower blood pressure and increase potassium loss.Metolazone is a quinazoline diuretic, with properties generally similar to the thiazide diuretics. A proximal action of metolazone has been shown in humans by increased excretion of phosphate and magnesium ions and by a markedly increased fractional excretion of sodium in patients with severely compromised glomerular filtration. This action has been demonstrated in animals by micropuncture studies.The actions of metolazone result from interference with the renal tubular mechanism of electrolyte reabsorption. Metolazone acts primarily to inhibit sodium reabsorption at the cortical diluting site and to a lesser extent in the proximal convoluted tubule. Sodium and chloride ions are excreted in approximately equivalent amounts. The increased delivery of sodium to the distal tubular exchange site results in increased potassium excretion. Metolazone does not inhibit carbonic anhydrase. The antihypertensive mechanism of action of metolazone is not fully understood but is presumed to be related to its saluretic and diuretic properties."
306,"[L47206]Oxaliplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug in the same family as cisplatin and carboplatin. Compared to cisplatin the two amine groups are replaced by diamino cyclohexane (DACH) group to provide a greater antitumor effect.[A797] However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties.[A797] Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics.[A260396] Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking.[A260396] However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects.[A260396] The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin’s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer.[A797]    Oxaliplatin was approved by the FDA on January 9, 2004 and is currently marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trademark Eloxatin&reg;.[L47316]In vivo studies have shown antitumor activities of oxaliplatin against colon carcinoma.[L47206]Oxaliplatin undergoes nonenzymatic conversion in physiologic solutions to active derivatives via displacement of the labile oxalate ligand. Several transient reactive species are formed, including monoaquo and diaquo DACH platinum, which covalently bind with macromolecules. Both inter and intrastrand Pt-DNA crosslinks are formed. Crosslinks are formed between the N7 positions of two adjacent guanines (GG), adjacent adenine-guanines (AG), and guanines separated by an intervening nucleotide (GNG). These crosslinks inhibit DNA replication and transcription. Cytotoxicity is cell-cycle nonspecific.[L47206]    "
307,"For production of local or regional anesthesia by infiltration techniques such as percutaneous injection and intravenous regional anesthesia by peripheral nerve block techniques such as brachial plexus and intercostal and by central neural techniques such as lumbar and caudal epidural blocks.A local anesthetic of the amide type now generally used for surface anesthesia. It is one of the most potent and toxic of the long-acting local anesthetics and its parenteral use is restricted to spinal anesthesia. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p1006)Dibucaine is an amide-type local anesthetic, similar to lidocaine.Local anesthetics block both the initiation and conduction of nerve impulses by decreasing the neuronal membrane's permeability to sodium ions through sodium channel inhibition. This reversibly stabilizes the membrane and inhibits depolarization, resulting in the failure of a propagated action potential and subsequent conduction blockade."
308,"For the treatment of CMV retinitis in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and for treatment of acyclovir-resistant mucocutaneous HSV infections in immunocompromised patients.An antiviral agent used in the treatment of cytomegalovirus retinitis. Foscarnet also shows activity against human herpes viruses and HIV.Foscarnet is an organic analogue of inorganic pyrophosphate that inhibits replication of herpes viruses <i>in vitro</i> including cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2). Foscarnet does not require activation (phosphorylation) by thymidine kinase or other kinases and therefore is active in vitro against HSV TK deficient mutants and CMV UL97 mutants. Thus, HSV strains resistant to acyclovir or CMV strains resistant to ganciclovir may be sensitive to foscarnet. However, acyclovir or ganciclovir resistant mutants with alterations in the viral DNA polymerase may be resistant to foscarnet and may not respond to therapy with foscarnet. The combination of foscarnet and ganciclovir has been shown to have enhanced activity in vitro.Foscarnet exerts its antiviral activity by a selective inhibition at the pyrophosphate binding site on virus-specific DNA polymerases at concentrations that do not affect cellular DNA polymerases."
309,"Erlotinib is indicated for:    - The treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with tumors showing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations [FDA label].     - In combination with first-line treatment for patients diagnosed with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer [FDA label].    The safety and efficacy of erlotinib have not been established for patients with NSCLC whose tumors show other EGFR mutations. Additionally it is not recommended for use in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy. [FDA label]Erlotinib is an inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase that is used in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer and several other types of cancer. It is typically marketed under the trade name Tarceva. Erlotinib binds to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase in a reversible fashion at the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site of the receptor. Recent studies demonstrate that erlotinib is also a potent inhibitor of JAK2V617F, which is a mutant form of tyrosine kinase JAK2 found in most patients with polycythemia vera (PV) and a substantial proportion of patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis or essential thrombocythemia. This finding introduces the potential use of erlotinib in the treatment of JAK2V617F-positive PV and other myeloproliferative disorders.The mechanism of clinical antitumor action of erlotinib is not fully characterized. Erlotinib inhibits the intracellular phosphorylation of tyrosine kinase associated with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Specificity of inhibition with regard to other tyrosine kinase receptors has not been fully characterized. EGFR is expressed on the cell surface of normal cells and cancer cells."

311,"For the treatment of refractory partial epilepsy.Mephenytoin is used for the treatment of refractory partial epilepsy. Mephenytoin is a solid. This compound belongs to the phenylhydantoins. These are heterocyclic aromatic compounds containing an imiazolidinedione moiety substituted by a phenyl group. Mephenytoin is known to target sodium channel protein type 5 subunit alpha. Cytochrome P450 2C19, Cytochrome P450 2C8, Cytochrome P450 2C9, Cytochrome P450 2B6, Cytochrome P450 1A2, and Cytochrome P450 2D6 are known to metabolize mephenytoin. Mephenytoin is a hydantoin-derivative anticonvulsant used to control various partial seizures. Mephenytoin and oxazolidinedione derivatives are associated with higher incidences of blood dyscrasias compared to other anticonvulsants.Mephenytoin is an antiepileptic drug which can be useful in the treatment of epilepsy. The primary site of action appears to be the motor cortex where spread of seizure activity is inhibited. Possibly by promoting sodium efflux from neurons, mephenytoin tends to stabilize the threshold against hyperexcitability caused by excessive stimulation or environmental changes capable of reducing membrane sodium gradient. This includes the reduction of posttetanic potentiation at synapses. Loss of posttetanic potentiation prevents cortical seizure foci from detonating adjacent cortical areas. Mephenytoin reduces the maximal activity of brain stem centers responsible for the tonic phase of tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizures.The mechanism of action of mephenytoin is not definitely known, but extensive research strongly suggests that its main mechanism is to block frequency-, use- and voltage-dependent neuronal sodium channels, and therefore limit repetitive firing of action potentials."
312,"For the treatment of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, acute pain in adults, and primary dysmenorrhea, as well as acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without auras.Rofecoxib is used for the treatment of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, acute pain in adults, and primary dysmenorrhea, as well as acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without auras. Rofecoxib is a solid. This compound belongs to the stilbenes. These are organic compounds containing a 1,2-diphenylethylene moiety. Stilbenes (C6-C2-C6 ) are derived from the common phenylpropene (C6-C3) skeleton building block. The introduction of one or more hydroxyl groups to a phenyl ring lead to stilbenoids. Rofecoxib has a half-life of 17 hours and its mean oral bioavailability at therapeutically recommended doses of 125, 25, and 50 mg is approximately 93%. The proteins that rofecoxib target include elastin and prostaglandin G/H synthase 2. Cytochrome P450 1A2, Cytochrome P450 3A4, Cytochrome P450 2C9, Cytochrome P450 2C8, and Prostaglandin G/H synthase 1 are known to metabolize rofecoxib. On September 30, 2004, Merck voluntarily withdrew rofecoxib from the market because of concerns about increased risk of heart attack and stroke associated with long-term, high-dosage use.Rofecoxib, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, is classified as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Unlike celecoxib, rofecoxib lacks a sulfonamide chain and does not require CYP450 enzymes for metabolism. Like other NSAIDs, rofecoxib exhibits anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activity. NSAIDs appear to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis via the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX), which are responsible for catalyzing the formation of prostaglandins in the arachidonic acid pathyway. There are at least two isoenzymes, COX-1 and COX-2, that have been identified. Although the exact mechanisms have not been clearly established, NSAIDs exert their anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic primarily through the inhibition of COX-2. The inhibition of COX-1 is principally responsible for the negative effects on the GI mucosa. As rofecoxib is selective for COX-2, it may be potentially associated with a decreased risk of certain adverse events, but more data is needed to fully evaulate the drug.The anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic effects of NSAIDs appear to result from the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. Although the exact mechanism of action has not been determined, these effects appear to be mediated through the inhibition of the COX-2 isoenzyme at the sites of inflammation with subsequent reduction in the synthesis of certain prostaglandins from their arachidonic acid precursors. Rofecoxib selectively inhibits the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme, which is important for the mediation of inflammation and pain. Unlike non-selective NSAIDs, rofecoxib does not inhibit platelet aggregation. It also has little to no affinity for COX-1."

It has been proven to be effective for the treatment of common bacterial infections in the ear, sinus, throat, lungs, and skin. Cefdinir was approved by the FDA in 1997 to treat a variety of mild to moderate infections and was initially marketed by Abbvie.[A180739] Because of its chemical structure, it is effective against organisms that are resistant to first-line cephalosporin therapy due to the production of beta-lactamase enzymes.[A180724,A180727]Cefdinir is a bactericidal agent that treats bacterial infections by interfering with cell wall synthesis.[L7330]  Cefdinir exerts broad-spectrum activity against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections. It is effective against several beta-lactamase enzyme producing bacteria. As a result, many organisms that are resistant to other cephalosporins may be susceptible to cefdinir.[A180727,A180733,L7351]Five-member thiazolidine rings that make up penicillins are replaced in cephalosporins by a six-member dihydrothiazine ring, conferring greater bactericidal activity. This This 6-member ring enables cefdinir and other cephalosporins to resist inactivation by certain bacterial enzymes.[A180772]    With a mechanism similar to other beta-lactam antibiotics, the bactericidal activity of cefdinir is caused by the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Cefdinir, like other cephalosporins, penetrates the bacterial cell wall, combats inactivation by beta-lactamase enzymes, and inactivates penicillin-binding proteins.[A180772] This interferes with the final step of transpeptidation in cell walls, eventually leading to cell lysis, which eventually leads to the death of bacteria that are susceptible to this drug.[A180724] Cefdinir has shown affinity to penicillin protein binding proteins 2 and 3. [A15746,A180760,A15747] It has also been shown to inhibit transpeptidase enzymes of various bacteria, which may play a role in its bactericidal action.[A180766,A180769] One in vitro study suggests that cefdinir inhibits myeloperoxidase release extracellularly.[A11897] The impact of this potential drug target in relation to its mechanism of action is unknown."
314,"Ciprofloxacin is only indicated in infections caused by susceptible bacteria.[L6469,L6472,L6475,L6478,L6481,L6484,L6487,L6490,L6493]    Ciprofloxacin immediate release tablets, oral suspensions, and intravenous injections are indicated for the treatment of skin and skin structure infections, bone and joint infections, complicated intra-abdominal infections, nosocomial pneumonia, febrile neutropenia, adults who have inhaled anthrax, plague, chronic bacterial prostatitis, lower respiratory tract infections including acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, urinary tract infections, complicated urinary tract infections in pediatrics, complicated pyelonephritis in pediatrics, and acute sinusitis.[L6481,L6478]    A ciprofloxacin otic solution and otic suspension with hydrocortisone are indicated for acute otitis externa.[L6469,L6484] Ciprofloxacin suspension with dexamethasone is indicated for acute otitis media in pediatric patients with tympanostomy tubes or acute otitis externa.[L6490] A ciprofloxacin intratympanic injection is indicated for pediatric patients with bilateral otitis media with effusion who are having tympanostomy tubes placed or pediatric patients 6 months or older with acute otitis externa.[L6493]    A ciprofloxacin eye drop is indicated for bacterial corneal ulcers and conjunctivitis.[L6472] A ciprofloxacin eye ointment is indicated for bacterial conjunctivitis.[L6475]    A ciprofloxacin extended release tablet is indicated for uncomplicated urinary tract infections, complicated urinary tract infections, and acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis.[L6487]Ciprofloxacin is a second generation fluoroquinolone that has spawned many derivative antibiotics.[A178870] It is formulated for oral, intravenous, intratympanic, ophthalmic, and otic administration for a number of bacterial infections.[L6469,L6472,L6475,L6478,L6481,L6484,L6487,L6490,L6493]    The first ciprofloxacin containing product was FDA approved on 22 October 1987.[L6463]Ciprofloxacin is a second generation fluoroquinolone that is active against many Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria.[A178870,L6469,L6472,L6475,L6478,L6481,L6484,L6487,L6490,L6493] It produces its action through inhibition of bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV.[A178885] Ciprofloxacin binds to bacterial DNA gyrase with 100 times the affinity of mammalian DNA gyrase.[A178894] There is no cross resistance between fluoroquinolones and other classes of antibiotics, so it may be of clinical value when other antibiotics are no longer effective.[A178894] Ciprofloxain and its derivatives are also being investigated for its action against malaria, cancers, and AIDS.[A178885]Ciprofloxacin acts on bacterial topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV.[A178885] Ciprofloxacin's targeting of the alpha subunits of DNA gyrase prevents it from supercoiling the bacterial DNA which prevents DNA replication.[A178876,A178882]"
315,"Nortriptyline is indicated for the relief of the symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD).[L11878] Some off-label uses for this drug include treatment of chronic pain, myofascial pain, neuralgia, and irritable bowel syndrome.[A191083,L11878]Nortriptyline hydrochloride, the active metabolite of [amitriptyline], is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA).[L11878] It is used in the treatment of major depression and is also used off-label for chronic pain and other conditions.[L11881]Nortriptyline exerts antidepressant effects likely by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine at neuronal cell membranes. It also exerts antimuscarinic effects through its actions on the acetylcholine receptor.[L11878,L11881]Though prescribing information does not identify a specific mechanism of action for nortriptyline[L11878], is believed that nortriptyline either inhibits the reuptake of the neurotransmitter serotonin at the neuronal membrane or acts at the level of the beta-adrenergic receptors. It displays a more selective reuptake inhibition for noradrenaline, which may explain increased symptom improvement after nortriptyline therapy.[T28] Tricyclic antidepressants do not inhibit monoamine oxidase nor do they affect dopamine reuptake.[L11878] As with other tricyclics, nortriptyline displays affinity for other receptors including mACh receptors, histamine receptors, 5-HT receptors, in addition to other receptors.[A18198,A4909,T28] "
316,"Treatment of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphomas, Wilms' tumor, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma. Liposomal vincristine is indicated for the treatment of relapsed Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Vincristine is an antitumor vinca alkaloid isolated from Vinca Rosea. It is marketed under several brand names, many of which have different formulations such as Marqibo (liposomal injection) and Vincasar. Vincristine is indicated for the treatment of acute leukaemia, malignant lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, acute erythraemia, and acute panmyelosis. vincristine sulfate is often chosen as part of polychemotherapy because of lack of significant bone–marrow suppression (at recommended doses) and of unique clinical toxicity (neuropathy).Vincristine is a vinca alkaloid antineoplastic agent used as a treatment for various cancers including breast cancer, Hodgkin's disease, Kaposi's sarcoma, and testicular cancer. The vinca alkaloids are structurally similar compounds comprised of 2 multiringed units, vindoline and catharanthine. The vinca alkaloids have become clinically useful since the discovery of their antitumour properties in 1959. Initially, extracts of the periwinkle plant (Catharanthus roseus) were investigated because of putative hypoglycemic properties, but were noted to cause marrow suppression in rats and antileukemic effects <i>in vitro</i>. Vincristine binds to the microtubular proteins of the mitotic spindle, leading to crystallization of the microtubule and mitotic arrest or cell death. Vincristine has some immunosuppressant effect. The vinca alkaloids are considered to be cell cycle phase-specific.The antitumor activity of Vincristine is thought to be due primarily to inhibition of mitosis at metaphase through its interaction with tubulin. Like other vinca alkaloids, Vincristine may also interfere with: 1) amino acid, cyclic AMP, and glutathione metabolism, 2) calmodulin-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transport ATPase activity, 3) cellular respiration, and 4) nucleic acid and lipid biosynthesis."
317,"Benazepril is indicated for the treatment of hypertension[A840]. Benazepril, brand name Lotensin, is a medication used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension), congestive heart failure, and chronic renal failure[A838,A837]. Upon cleavage of its ester group by the liver, benazepril is converted into its active form benazeprilat, a non-sulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor[A836].Benazepril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, is a prodrug which, when hydrolyzed by esterases to its active Benazeprilat[A836], is used to treat hypertension and heart failure, to reduce proteinuria and renal disease in patients with nephropathies, and to prevent stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiac death in high-risk patients[A840,A838,A837]. Benazepril and Benazeprilat inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in human subjects and animals[A840,A836]. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II[FDA Label]. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex[FDA Label].Benazeprilat, the active metabolite of Benazepril, competes with angiotensin I for binding at the angiotensin-converting enzyme, blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II[FDA Label]. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II[FDA Label]. As angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor and a negative-feedback mediator for renin activity, lower concentrations result in a decrease in blood pressure and stimulation of baroreceptor reflex mechanisms, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion[FDA Label]."
318,"For the relief of symptoms of depression in patients with neurotic or reactive depressive disorders as well as endogenous and psychotic depressions. May also be used to treat depression accompanied by anxiety or agitation.Amoxapine, the <i>N</i>-demethylated derivative of the antipsychotic agent loxapine, is a dibenzoxazepine-derivative tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). TCAs are structurally similar to phenothiazines. They contain a tricyclic ring system with an alkyl amine substituent on the central ring. In non-depressed individuals, amoxapine does not affect mood or arousal, but may cause sedation. In depressed individuals, amoxapine exerts a positive effect on mood. TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. In addition, TCAs down-regulate cerebral cortical &beta;-adrenergic receptors and sensitize post-synaptic serotonergic receptors with chronic use. The antidepressant effects of TCAs are thought to be due to an overall increase in serotonergic neurotransmission. TCAs also block histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptors, &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors and muscarinic receptors, which accounts for their sedative, hypotensive and anticholinergic effects (e.g. blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention), respectively. See toxicity section below for a complete listing of side effects. Amoxapine may be used to treat neurotic and reactive depressive disorders, endogenous and psychotic depression, and mixed symptoms of depression and anxiety or agitation.Amoxapine is a tricyclic antidepressant of the dibenzoxazepine class, chemically distinct from the dibenzodiazepines, dibenzocycloheptenes, and dibenzoxepines. It has a mild sedative component to its action. The mechanism of its clinical action in man is not well understood. In animals, amoxapine reduced the uptake of nor-epinephirine and serotonin and blocked the response of dopamine receptors to dopamine. Amoxapine is not a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. Clinical studies have demonstrated that amoxapine has a more rapid onset of action than either amitriptyline or imipramineAmoxapine acts by decreasing the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin (5-HT)."
319,"For the topical treatment of multiple actinic or solar keratoses. In the 5% strength it is also useful in the treatment of superficial basal cell carcinomas when conventional methods are impractical, such as with multiple lesions or difficult treatment sites. Fluorouracil injection is indicated in the palliative management of some types of cancer, including colon, esophageal, gastric, rectum, breast, biliary tract, stomach, head and neck, cervical, pancreas, renal cell, and carcinoid.A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.Fluorouracil is an antineoplastic anti-metabolite. Anti-metabolites masquerade as purine or pyrimidine - which become the building blocks of DNA. They prevent these substances from becoming incorporated into DNA during the ""S"" phase (of the cell cycle), stopping normal development and division. Fluorouracil blocks an enzyme which converts the cytosine nucleotide into the deoxy derivative. In addition, DNA synthesis is further inhibited because Fluorouracil blocks the incorporation of the thymidine nucleotide into the DNA strand.The precise mechanism of action has not been fully determined, but the main mechanism of fluorouracil is thought to be the binding of the deoxyribonucleotide of the drug (FdUMP) and the folate cofactor, N5�?0-methylenetetrahydrofolate, to thymidylate synthase (TS) to form a covalently bound ternary complex. This results in the inhibition of the formation of thymidylate from uracil, which leads to the inhibition of DNA and RNA synthesis and cell death. Fluorouracil can also be incorporated into RNA in place of uridine triphosphate (UTP), producing a fraudulent RNA and interfering with RNA processing and protein synthesis."
320,"Pyridostigmine is indicated for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.[L32408] When administered intravenously, it is indicated for the reversal or antagonism of the neuromuscular blocking effects of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants.[L32413]    Pyridostigmine has also been used as a prophylactic agent against irreversible organophosphorus acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, primarily in a military capacity.[L32418]Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease involving dysfunction at the neuromuscular junction, most commonly due to autoantibodies directed against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR), which results in muscle tone loss, muscle weakness, and fatigue.[A231004] Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have been the symptomatic treatment of choice in myasthenia gravis since the 1930s with the early use of [physostigmine] and [neostigmine]. By inhibiting the breakdown of acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction, they increase signalling and relieve symptoms.[A231004, L32408, L32413] Pyridostigmine is the current drug of choice, with superior pharmacokinetics and reduced side effects compared to [neostigmine].[L32408, L32413] In addition to treating myasthenia gravis, pyridostigmine is used to reverse neuromuscular blocks, relieve symptoms in congenital myasthenic syndromes, and protect against certain nerve agents, notably during the Gulf War.[A231009, A231014, L32413, L32418]    Pyridostigmine was granted initial FDA approval on April 6, 1955, as an oral tablet. Possible dose forms have been expanded to include extended-release tablets, syrups, and injections, marketed under various brand and generic names.[L32408, L32413]Pyridostigmine bromide, designated as 3-hydroxy-1-methyl-pyridinium bromide dimethyl-carbamate, is an orally active reversible cholinesterase inhibitor similar to [neostigmine] but with a milder adverse effect profile and a longer duration of action. Pyridostigmine may, specifically in the case of excessive administration, result in a cholinergic crisis, with symptoms mimicking a myasthenic crisis. Administration of atropine is recommended in the case of a true cholinergic crisis or to counteract muscarinic/nicotinic effects such as bradycardia and excessive bronchial secretions.[L32408, L32413]Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease involving dysfunction at the neuromuscular junction most commonly due to autoantibodies directed against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR), but also against other targets such as the muscle-specific kinase (MUSK), lipoprotein-related protein 4 (LRP4), or agrin.[A231004] In the case of AChR antibodies, AChRs are directly bound and cross-linked, impairing acetylcholine binding and contributing through various mechanisms to receptor degradation.[A231004] The lack of acetylcholine signalling leads to muscle tone loss, muscle weakness, and fatigue.[A231004]    Pyridostigmine is a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that increases extracellular acetylcholine levels in the neuromuscular junction by impairing its breakdown by acetylcholinesterase.[L32408, L32413] The increased acetylcholine leads to increased neural transmission across the junction, which drastically improves myasthenia gravis symptoms.[A231004]    In addition to its use in myasthenia gravis and in reversing neuromuscular blocks, pyridostigmine is also a common first-line treatment in congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS), of which there are multiple subtypes caused by mutations in more than 30 distinct genes.[A231009, A231014] CMS present similarly to myasthenia gravis, albeit due to distinct underlying causes, and often benefit from pyridostigmine. However, in some subgroups, treatment with pyridostigmine is detrimental; detailed genetic testing is required before starting therapy.[A231009, A231014]"
321,"For the treatment of anxiety and status epilepticus.Adinazolam (Deracyn®) is a benzodiazepine derivative with anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative, and antidepressant properties. Adinazolam was first developed to enhance the antidepressant effects of [alprazolam]. It has never been approved by the FDA for clinical use.Adinazolam is a benzodiazepine derivative used to treat anxiety, status epilepticus, and for sedation induction and anterograde amnesia. Adinazolam binds with high affinity to the GABA benzodiazepine receptor complex. Considerable evidence suggest that the central pharmacologic/therapeutic actions of alprazolam are mediated via interaction with this receptor complex.Adinazolam binds to peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors which interact allosterically with GABA receptors. This potentiates the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, increasing the inhibition of the ascending reticular activating system and blocking the cortical and limbic arousal that occurs following stimulation of the reticular pathways."
322,"For the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma.Zafirlukast is an oral leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) for the maintenance treatment of asthma, often used in conjunction with an inhaled steroid and/or long-acting bronchodilator. It is available as a tablet and is usually dosed twice daily. Another leukotriene receptor antagonist is montelukast (Singulair), which is usually taken just once daily.    Zafirlukast blocks the action of the cysteinyl leukotrienes on the CysLT1 receptors, thus reducing constriction of the airways, build-up of mucus in the lungs and inflammation of the breathing passages.Zafirlukast is a synthetic, selective peptide leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) indicated for the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma. Patients with asthma were found in one study to be 25-100 times more sensitive to the bronchoconstricting activity of inhaled LTD4 than nonasthmatic subjects. <i>In vitro</i> studies demonstrated that zafirlukast antagonized the contractile activity of three leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4) in conducting airway smooth muscle from laboratory animals and humans. Zafirlukast prevented intradermal LTD4-induced increases in cutaneous vascular permeability and inhibited inhaled LTD4-induced influx of eosinophils into animal lungs.Zafirlukast is a selective and competitive receptor antagonist of leukotriene D4 and E4 (LTD4 and LTE4), components of slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRSA). Cysteinyl leukotriene production and receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma, including airway edema, smooth muscle constriction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma."
323,"Used to manage hyperthyroidism which is due to an overactive thyroid gland (Grave's disease).A thiourea antithyroid agent. Propythiouracil inhibits the synthesis of thyroxine and inhibits the peripheral conversion of throxine to tri-iodothyronine. It is used in the treatment of hyperthyroidism. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopeoia, 30th ed, p534)Propylthiouracil is a thiourea antithyroid agent. Grave's disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. It is an autoimmune disease where an individual's own antibodies attach to thyroid stimulating hormone receptors within cells of the thyroid gland and then trigger overproduction of thyroid hormone. The two thyroid hormones manufactured by the thyroid gland, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), are formed by combining iodine and a protein called thyroglobulin with the assistance of an enzyme called peroxidase. PTU inhibits iodine and peroxidase from their normal interactions with thyroglobulin to form T4 and T3. This action decreases thyroid hormone production. PTU also interferes with the conversion of T4 to T3, and, since T3 is more potent than T4, this also reduces the activity of thyroid hormones. The actions and use of propylthiouracil are similar to those of methimazole.Propylthiouracil binds to thyroid peroxidase and thereby inhibits the conversion of iodide to iodine. Thyroid peroxidase normally converts iodide to iodine (via hydrogen peroxide as a cofactor) and also catalyzes the incorporation of the resulting iodide molecule onto both the 3 and/or 5 positions of the phenol rings of tyrosines found in thyroglobulin. Thyroglobulin is degraded to produce thyroxine (T4) and tri-iodothyronine (T3), which are the main hormones produced by the thyroid gland. Therefore propylthiouracil effectively inhibits the production of new thyroid hormones."
324,"For the treatment of hairy cell leukaemia refractory to alpha interferon.A potent inhibitor of adenosine deaminase. The drug is effective in the treatment of many lymphoproliferative malignancies, particularly hairy-cell leukemia. It is also synergistic with some other antineoplastic agents and has immunosuppressive activity.Pentostatin is an antineoplastic anti-metabolite used in the treatment of several forms of leukemia including acute nonlymphocytic leukemia and hairy cell leukemia. Anti-metabolites masquerade as purine or pyrimidine - which become the building blocks of DNA. They prevent these substances becoming incorporated in to DNA during the ""S"" phase (of the cell cycle), stopping normal development and division. It is a 6-thiopurine analogue of the naturally occurring purine bases hypoxanthine and guanine. Intracellular activation results in incorporation into DNA as a false purine base. An additional cytotoxic effect is related to its incorporation into RNA. Cytotoxicity is cell cycle phase-specific (S-phase).Pentostatin is a potent transition state inhibitor of adenosine deaminase (ADA), the greatest activity of which is found in cells of the lymphoid system. T-cells have higher ADA activity than B-cells, and T-cell malignancies have higher activity than B-cell malignancies. The cytotoxicity that results from prevention of catabolism of adenosine or deoxyadenosine is thought to be due to elevated intracellular levels of dATP, which can block DNA synthesis through inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase. Intracellular activation results in incorporation into DNA as a false purine base. An additional cytotoxic effect is related to its incorporation into RNA. Cytotoxicity is cell cycle phase-specific (S-phase)."
325,"For the treatment of psoriasis and vitiligoA naturally occurring furocoumarin compound found in several species of plants, including Psoralea corylifolia. It is a photoactive substance that forms DNA adducts in the presence of ultraviolet A irradiation.Methoxsalen selectively inhibits the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The guanine and cytosine content correlates with the degree of Methoxsalen-induced cross-linking. At high concentrations of the drug, cellular RNA and protein synthesis are also suppressed.After activation it binds preferentially to the guanine and cytosine moieties of DNA, leading to cross-linking of DNA, thus inhibiting DNA synthesis and function."
326,"For treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.A cyclooxygenase inhibiting, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAID) that is well established in treating rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis and used for musculoskeletal disorders, dysmenorrhea, and postoperative pain. Its long half-life enables it to be administered once daily.Piroxicam is in a class of drugs called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Piroxicam works by reducing hormones that cause inflammation and pain in the body. Piroxicam is used to reduce the pain, inflammation, and stiffness caused by rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.The antiinflammatory effect of Piroxicam may result from the reversible inhibition of cyclooxygenase, causing the peripheral inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. The prostaglandins are produced by an enzyme called Cox-1. Piroxicam blocks the Cox-1 enzyme, resulting into the disruption of production of prostaglandins. Piroxicam also inhibits the migration of leukocytes into sites of inflammation and prevents the formation of thromboxane A2, an aggregating agent, by the platelets."
327,"Lamotrigine is indicated as adjunctive therapy for the following seizure types in patients �? years of age: partial seizures, primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and generalized seizures due to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.[L9404]    It is also indicated for the process of conversion to drug monotherapy for those at least 16 years of age or older with partial seizures and currently are receiving treatment with carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or valproate as the single antiepileptic drug (AED).[L9404]    In addition to the above, lamotrigine is also indicated for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder, delaying the time to mood episodes (which may include mania, hypomania, depression, mixed episodes) in adults at least 18 years or older, who have been treated for acute mood symptoms with standard therapy.[L9404]    Limitations of use    It is important to note that lamotirigine should not be used in the treatment of acute mood episodes, as efficacy has not been established in this context.[L9404]Lamotrigine is an antiepileptic drug belonging in the phenyltriazine class. It is used in the treatment of both epilepsy and as a mood stabilizer in bipolar disorder. Lamotrigine is the first medication since lithium granted Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the maintenance treatment of bipolar type I. It is approved for use in more than 30 countries.[A191350]    Lamotrigine has relatively few side-effects and does not require laboratory monitoring. While it is indicated for epilepsy and bipolar disorders, there is evidence that lamotrigine could have some clinical efficacy in certain neuropathic pain states.[A849,A850]Lamotrigine likely prevents seizures and prevents mood symptoms via stabilizing presynaptic neuronal membranes and preventing the release of excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate, which contribute to seizure activity.[A191350,L9404]     A note on cardiovascular effects    The metabolite of lamotrigine, 2-N-methyl metabolite (formed by glucuronidation), is reported to cause dose-dependent prolongations of the PR interval, widening of the QRS complex, and at higher doses, complete AV block. Although this harmful metabolite is only found in trace amounts in humans, plasma concentrations may increase in conditions that cause decreased drug glucuronidation, such as liver disease.[A191335,L9404,L12183]The exact mechanism of action of lamotrigine is not fully elucidated, as it may exert cellular activities that contribute to its efficacy in a range of conditions. Although chemically unrelated, lamotrigine actions resemble those of phenytoin and carbamazepine, inhibiting voltage-sensitive sodium channels, stabilizing neuronal membranes, thereby modulating the release of presynaptic excitatory neurotransmitters.[A191335,A191350,L9404]     Lamotrigine likely acts by inhibiting sodium currents by selective binding to the inactive sodium channel, suppressing the release of the excitatory amino acid, glutamate. The mechanism of action of lamotrigine in reducing anticonvulsant activity is likely the same in managing bipolar disorder. Studies on lamotrigine have identified its binding to sodium channels in a fashion similar to local anesthetics, which could explain the demonstrated clinical benefit of lamotrigine in some neuropathic pain states.[T28]     Lamotrigine displays binding properties to several different receptors. In laboratory binding assays, it demonstrates weak inhibitory effect on the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor. Lamotrigine also weakly binds to Adenosine A1/A2 receptors, α1/α2/β adrenergic receptors, dopamine D1/D2 receptors, GABA A/B receptors, histamine H1 receptors, κ-opioid receptor (KOR), mACh receptors and serotonin 5-HT2 receptors with an IC50>100 µM. Weak inhibitory effects were observed at sigma opioid receptors.[L9404] An in vivo study revealed evidence that lamotrigine inhibits Cav2.3 (R-type) calcium currents, which may also contribute to its anticonvulsant effects.[A31737] "
328,"Hydroxyzine is indicated for the symptomatic relief of anxiety and tension associated with psychoneuroses, and as an adjunct in organic disease states in which anxiety is manifested.[L9677] It is also indicated in the treatment of histamine-mediated pruritus and pruritus due to allergic conditions such as chronic urticaria.[L9677]    Canadian labeling states that hydroxyzine is also indicated in adults and children as a premedication prior to medical procedures, such as dental surgery.[L9680] It is also used in the control of nausea and vomiting, excluding nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.[L9680]Hydroxyzine is a first-generation histamine H1-receptor antagonist of the dephenylmethane and piperazine classes that exhibits sedative, anxiolytic, and antiemetic properties.[A1257,A187589] It was first developed in 1955,[A189726] and has since remained a relatively common treatment for allergic conditions such as pruritus, urticaria, dermatoses, and histamine-mediated pruritus.[L9677] The active metabolite of hydroxyzine, [cetirizine], is also available as an active ingredient in allergic medications, and is responsible for much of its hydroxyzine's antihistaminic effect.[A189753] Hydroxyzine is also used for generalized anxiety disorder, tension caused by psychoneurosis, and other conditions with manifestations of anxiety.[L9677]Hydroxyzine blocks the activity of histamine to relieve allergic symptoms such as pruritus.[L9677] Activity at off-targets also allows for its use as a sedative anxiolytic and an antiemetic in certain disease states.[L9680]    Hydroxyzine is relatively fast-acting, with an onset of effect that occurs between 15 and 60 minutes and a duration of action between 4-6 hours.[A1257] Hydroxyzine may potentiate the effects of central nervous system (CNS) depressants following general anesthesia - patients maintained on hydroxyzine should receive reduced doses of any CNS depressants required.[L9677] Hydroxyzine is reported to prolong the QT/QTc interval based on postmarketing reports of rare events of Torsade de Pointes, cardiac arrest, and sudden death, and should be used with caution in patients with an increased baseline risk for QTc prolongation.[L9680,A189726] The H1 histamine receptor is responsible for mediating hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. Exposure to an allergen results in degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes.[A1495]    Hydroxyzine is a potent inverse agonist of histamine H1-receptors[A1257] - inverse agonists are agents that are considered to have a ""negative efficacy"", so rather than simply blocking activity at a receptor they actively dampen its activity.[T707] Inverse agonism at these receptors is responsible for hydroxyzine's efficacy in the treatment of histaminic edema, flare, and pruritus.    Hydroxyzine is not a cortical depressant, so its sedative properties likely occur at the subcortical level of the CNS.[L9677] These sedative properties allow activity as an anxiolytic. Antiemetic efficacy is likely secondary to activity at off-targets.[A189753]"
329,"For the prevention and treatment of influenza A and B.A guanido-neuraminic acid that is used to inhibit neuraminidase.Zanamivir, an antiviral agent, is a neuraminidase inhibitor indicated for treatment of uncomplicated acute illness due to influenza A and B virus in adults and pediatric patients 7 years and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 2 days. Zanamivir has also been shown to significantly inhibit the human sialidases NEU3 and NEU2 in the micromolar range (Ki 3.7 +/-0.48 and 12.9+/-0.07 microM, respectively), which could account for some of the rare side effects of zanamivir.The proposed mechanism of action of zanamivir is via inhibition of influenza virus neuraminidase with the possibility of alteration of virus particle aggregation and release. By binding and inhibiting the neuraminidase protein, the drug renders the influenza virus unable to escape its host cell and infect others."
330,"Used in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), to improve exercise ability and to decrease the rate of clinical worsening (in patients with WHO Class III or IV symptoms).Bosentan is a dual endothelin receptor antagonist marketed under the trade name Tracleer by Actelion Pharmaceuticals. Bosentan is used to treat pulmonary hypertension by blocking the action of endothelin molecules that would otherwise promote narrowing of the blood vessels and lead to high blood pressure.Bosentan belongs to a class of drugs known as endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs). Patients with PAH have elevated levels of endothelin, a potent blood vessel constrictor, in their plasma and lung tissue. Bosentan blocks the binding of endothelin to its receptors, thereby negating endothelin's deleterious effects.Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a neurohormone, the effects of which are mediated by binding to ETA and ETB receptors in the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle. It displays a slightly higher affinity towards ETA receptors than ETB receptors. ET-1 concentrations are elevated in plasma and lung tissue of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, suggesting a pathogenic role for ET-1 in this disease. Bosentan is a specific and competitive antagonist at endothelin receptor types ETA and ETB."

It was developed in response to the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance in bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus. It was granted fast-track approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on June 17, 2005.Tigecycline is the first clinically-available drug in a new class of antibiotics called the glycylcyclines. Glycylcyclines are a new class of antibiotics derived from tetracycline. These tetracycline analogues are specifically designed to overcome two common mechanisms of tetracycline resistance, namely resistance mediated by acquired efflux pumps and/or ribosomal protection. Glycylcycline antibiotics have a similar mechanism of action as tetracycline antibiotics. Both classes of antibiotics bind to the 30S ribosomal subunit to prevent the amino-acyl tRNA from binding to the A site of the ribosome. However, the glycylcyclines appear to bind more effectively than the tetracyclines.Tigecycline, a glycylcycline, inhibits protein translation in bacteria by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit and blocking entry of amino-acyl tRNA molecules into the A site of the ribosome. This prevents incorporation of amino acid residues into elongating peptide chains. Tigecycline carries a glycylamido moiety attached to the 9-position of minocycline. The substitution pattern is not present in any naturally occurring or semisynthetic tetracycline and imparts certain microbiologic properties to tigecycline. Tigecycline is not affected by the two major tetracycline resistance mechanisms, ribosomal protection and efflux. Accordingly, tigecycline has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity against a broad spectrum of bacterial pathogens. There has been no cross resistance observed between tigecycline and other antibiotics. Tigecycline is not affected by resistance mechanisms such as beta-lactamases (including extended spectrum beta-lactamases), target site modifications, macrolide efflux pumps or enzyme target changes (e.g. gyrase/topoisomerase). In vitro studies have not demonstrated antagonism between tigecycline and other commonly used antibacterial drugs. In general, tigecycline is considered bacteriostatic."
332,"For use as a temporary measure in hospitalized patients with acute respiratory insufficiency superimposed on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.A central respiratory stimulant with a brief duration of action. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmocopoeia, 30th ed, p1225)Doxapram is an analeptic agent (a stimulant of the central nervous system). The respiratory stimulant action is manifested by an increase in tidal volume associated with a slight increase in respiratory rate. A pressor response may result following doxapram administration. Provided there is no impairment of cardiac function, the pressor effect is more marked in hypovolemic than in normovolemic states. The pressor response is due to the improved cardiac output rather than peripheral vasoconstriction. Following doxapram administration, an increased release of catecholamines has been noted.Doxapram produces respiratory stimulation mediated through the peripheral carotid chemoreceptors. It is thought to stimulate the carotid body by inhibiting certain potassium channels."
333,"For the treatment of high blood pressure and management of edema.Benzthiazide is used to treat hypertension and edema. Like other thiazides, benzthiazide promotes water loss from the body (diuretics). They inhibit Na+/Cl- reabsorption from the distal convoluted tubules in the kidneys. Thiazides also cause loss of potassium and an increase in serum uric acid. Thiazides are often used to treat hypertension, but their hypotensive effects are not necessarily due to their diuretic activity. Thiazides have been shown to prevent hypertension-related morbidity and mortality although the mechanism is not fully understood. Thiazides cause vasodilation by activating calcium-activated potassium channels (large conductance) in vascular smooth muscles and inhibiting various carbonic anhydrases in vascular tissue.Benzthiazide is used to treat hypertension and edema.

Thiazides like benzthiazide also inhibit sodium ion transport across the renal tubular epithelium through binding to the thiazide sensitive sodium-chloride transporter. This results in an increase in potassium excretion via the sodium-potassium exchange mechanism. The antihypertensive mechanism of benzthiazide is less well understood although it may be mediated through its action on carbonic anhydrases in the smooth muscle or through its action on the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (KCa) channel, also found in the smooth muscle."
334,"Methotrexate oral solution is indicated for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia and pediatric polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis.[L7144] Methotrexate injections for subcutaneous use are indicated for severe active rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and severe, recalcitrant, disabling psoriasis.[L7147,L7150,L10457] It has also been approved by the EMA for the treatment of adult patients requiring systemic therapy for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.[L48796]    Other formulations are indicated to treat gestational choriocarcinoma, chorioadenoma destruens, hydatiform mole, breast cancer, epidermoid cancer of the head and neck, advanced mycosis fungoides, lung cancer, and advanced non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.[L7180] It is also used in the maintenance of acute lymphocytic leukemia.[L7180] Methotrexate is also given before treatment with leucovorin to prolong relapse-free survival following surgical removal of a tumour in non-metastatic osteosarcoma.[L7180]Methotrexate is a folate derivative that inhibits several enzymes responsible for nucleotide synthesis.[A180322] This inhibition leads to suppression of inflammation as well as prevention of cell division.[A180322] Because of these effects, methotrexate is often used to treat inflammation caused by arthritis or to control cell division in neoplastic diseases such as breast cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.[A180322,L7144,L7147,L7150,L7180]    Due to the toxic effects of methotrexate, it is indicated for treatment of some forms of arthritis and severe psoriasis only if first line treatment has failed or patients are intolerant of those treatments.[L7180]    Methotrexate was granted FDA approval on 7 December 1953.[L7198]Methotrexate inhibits enzymes responsible for nucleotide synthesis which prevents cell division and leads to anti-inflammatory actions.[A180322] It has a long duration of action and is generally given to patients once weekly.[A180322,L7144,L7147,L7150] Methotrexate has a narrow therapeutic index.[A180325]    Do not take methotrexate daily.[L7147,L7150]Methotrexate enters tissues and is converted to a methotrexate polyglutamate by folylpolyglutamate.[A180322]    Methotrexate's mechanism of action is due to its inhibition of enzymes responsible for nucleotide synthesis including  dihydrofolate reductase, thymidylate synthase, aminoimidazole caboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase (AICART), and amido phosphoribosyltransferase.[A180322] Inhibtion of nucleotide synthesis prevents cell division.    In rheumatoid arthritis, methotrexate polyglutamates inhibit AICART more than methotrexate.[A180322] This inhibition leads to accumulation of AICART ribonucleotide, which inhibits adenosine deaminase, leading to an accumulation of adenosine triphosphate and adenosine in the extracellular space, stimulating adenosine receptors, leading to anti-inflammatory action.[A180322]"
335,"Carbamazepine is indicated for the treatment of epilepsy and pain associated with true trigeminal neuralgia.[L1335] In particular, carbamazepine has shown efficacy in treating mixed seizures, partial seizures with complex symptoms, and generalized tonic-clonic seizures.[A180301,L1335] Carbamazepine is also indicated for the treatment of manic episodes and mixed manic-depressive episodes caused by bipolar I disorder.[L1335] Some off-label, unapproved uses of carbamazepine include the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome and restless leg syndrome.[A180415,A180421]Carbamazepine, also known as Tegretol, is an anticonvulsant drug and analgesic drug used to control seizures and to treat pain resulting from trigeminal neuralgia. It was initially approved by the FDA in 1965.[A180301] Aside from the above uses, this drug is also given to control the symptoms of bipolar 1.[L1335] Interestingly, carbamazepine was the first anticonvulsant used to treat individuals with bipolar disorder.[A180319]**General effects**    Carbamazepine treats seizures and the symptoms of trigeminal neuralgia by inhibiting sodium channels.  In bipolar 1 disorder, carbamazepine has been found to decrease mania symptoms in a clinically significant manner according to the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS).[L1335] Carbamazepine has a narrow therapeutic index.[A180301]    **A note on genetic variation and carbamazepine use**    In studies of Han Chinese ancestry patients, a pronounced association between the HLA-B*1502 genotype and Steven Johnson syndrome and/or toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) resulting from carbamazepine use was observed.[A180397]Carbamazepine's mechanism of action is not fully elucidated and is widely debated.[A180310,L9713] One major hypothesis is that carbamazepine inhibits sodium channel firing, treating seizure activity. Animal research studies have demonstrated that carbamazepine exerts its effects by lowering polysynaptic nerve response and inhibiting post-tetanic potentiation. In both cats and rats, carbamazepine was shown to decrease pain caused by infraorbital nerve stimulation. A decrease in the action potential in the nucleus ventralis of the thalamus in the brain and inhibition of the lingual mandibular reflex were observed in other studies after carbamazepine use. Carbamazepine causes the above effects by binding to voltage-dependent sodium channels and preventing action potentials, which normally lead to stimulatory effects on nerves.[A180403,T634] In bipolar disorder, carbamazepine is thought to increase dopamine turnover and increase GABA transmission, treating manic and depressive symptoms.[L7216]    A common issue that has arisen is resistance to this drug in up to 30% of epileptic patients, which may occur to altered metabolism in patients with variant genotypes.[A180436] A potential therapeutic target to combat carbamazepine resistance has recently been identified as the EPHX1 gene promoter, potentially conferring resistance to carbamazepine through methylation.[A180439]"

337,"For the treatment of vertigo/meniere's disease, nausea and vomiting, motion sickness and also useful for vestibular symptoms of other origins.First synthesized by Janssen Pharmaceuticals in 1955, cinnarizine is an anti-histaminic drug mainly used for the control of vestibular disorders and motion sickness. Cinnarizine is a specific calcium channel blocker that primarily works on the central vestibular system to interfere with the signal transmission between vestibular apparatus of the inner ear and the vomiting centre of the hypothalamus. Cinnarizine could be also viewed as a nootropic drug because of its vasorelaxating abilities (due to calcium channel blockage), which happen mostly in brain. Combination use of cinnarizine with other nootropics, such as [piracetam] resulted in enhanced effect of boosting brain oxygen supply.Cinnarizine is an antihistamine and a calcium channel blocker. Histamines mediate a number of activities such as contraction of smooth muscle of the airways and gastrointestinal tract, vasodilatation, cardiac stimulation, secretion of gastric acid, promotion of interleukin release and chemotaxis of eosinophils and mast cells. Competitive antagonists at histamine H1 receptors may be divided into first (sedating) and second (non-sedating) generation agents. Some, such as Cinnarizine also block muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and are used as anti-emetic agents. Cinnarizine through its calcium channel blocking ability also inhibits stimulation of the vestibular system.Cinnarizine inhibits contractions of vascular smooth muscle cells by blocking L-type and T-type voltage gated calcium channels. Cinnarizine has also been implicated in binding to dopamine D2 receptors, histamine H1 receptors, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. "

339,"The intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intraosseous and endotracheal use of atropine is indicated for the temporary blockade of severe or life-threatening muscarinic effects.[L42815,L42835] The intramuscular use of atropine in the form of a pen injector is indicated for the treatment of poisoning by susceptible organophosphorus nerve agents having cholinesterase activity as well as organophosphorus or carbamate insecticides in adult and pediatric patients.[L42825] The ophthalmic use of atropine is indicated for mydriasis, cycloplegia, and penalization of the healthy eye in the treatment of amblyopia.[L42840,L42865]Atropine is an alkaloid originally synthesized from Atropa belladonna. It is a racemic mixture of d-and l-hyoscyamine, of which only l-hyoscyamine is pharmacologically active.[A251670,L42835] Atropine is generally available as a sulfate salt and can be administered by intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraosseous, endotracheal and ophthalmic methods. Oral atropine is only available in combination products.[A251660,L42840] Atropine is a competitive, reversible antagonist of muscarinic receptors that blocks the effects of acetylcholine and other choline esters.[A251660,L42815,L42825,L42835] It has a variety of therapeutic applications, including pupil dilation and the treatment of anticholinergic poisoning and symptomatic bradycardia in the absence of reversible causes.[A251660] Atropine is a relatively inexpensive drug and is included in the World Health Organization List of Essential Medicines.[A251675]Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent that antagonizes the effects of acetylcholine.[L42815,L42825,L42835] In small doses, atropine slows heart rate, and tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Compared to [scopolamine], atropine has a more potent and prolonged effect on the heart, intestine and bronchial muscle, but a weaker effect on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands. Atropine leads to increased respiratory rate and depth of respiration, possibly due to the drug-induced bronchiolar dilatation rather than its mild effect on vagal excitation.[L42835]    At an adequate dose, atropine abolishes different types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. Atropine can be used to prevent or abolish bradycardia or asystole induced by the injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus.[L42835] When vagal activity is an etiologic factor, atropine may also lessen the degree of partial heart block. In clinical doses, atropine counteracts the peripheral dilatation and abrupt decrease in blood pressure produced by choline esters. However, when given by itself, atropine does not exert a striking or uniform effect on blood vessels or blood pressure.[L42835] The use of topical atropine in the eye induces mydriasis by inhibiting the contraction of the circular pupillary sphincter muscle normally stimulated by acetylcholine. This results in the contraction of the countering radial pupillary dilator muscle and pupil dilation.[L42830]    The use of atropine may precipitate acute glaucoma and convert partial organic pyloric stenosis into complete obstruction. Atropine may also lead to complete urinary retention in patients with prostatic hypertrophy and cause the thickening of bronchial secretions and formation of viscid plugs in patients with chronic lung disease.[L42835]Atropine binds to and inhibits muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, competitively blocking the effects of acetylcholine and other choline esters.[L42815,L42825,L42835] It acts as a reversible non-specific antagonist of muscarinic receptors, showing affinity for the M1, M2, M3, M4 and M5 receptor subtypes.[A251665] Atropine antagonizes the effects of acetylcholine on tissues innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, such as smooth muscle, cardiac tissue, exocrine glands and the central nervous system. Also, it acts in less innervated smooth muscle that responds to endogenous acetylcholine.[A251670,L42815] The actions of atropine can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites (for instance, the use of anticholinesterase agents that inhibit the hydrolysis of acetylcholine).[L42835]"
340,"For relief of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Also for the relief of mild to moderate pain.An anti-inflammatory analgesic and antipyretic highly bound to plasma proteins. It is pharmacologically similar to aspirin, but causes less gastrointestinal bleeding.Fenoprofen is a propionic acid derivative with analgesic, antiinflammatory and antipyretic properties. Fenoprofen inhibits prostaglandin synthesis by decreasing the enzyme needed for biosynthesis. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the anti-inflammatory action of fenoprofen has been evidenced by relief of pain, increase in grip strength, and reductions in joint swelling, duration of morning stiffness, and disease activity (as assessed by both the investigator and the patient). In patients with osteoarthritis, the anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of fenoprofen have been demonstrated by reduction in tenderness as a response to pressure and reductions in night pain, stiffness, swelling, and overall disease activity (as assessed by both the patient and the investigator). These effects have also been demonstrated by relief of pain with motion and at rest and increased range of motion in involved joints. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, clinical studies have shown fenoprofen to be comparable to aspirin in controlling the aforementioned measures of disease activity, but mild gastrointestinal reactions (nausea, dyspepsia) and tinnitus occurred less frequently in patients treated with fenoprofen than in aspirin-treated patients. It is not known whether fenoprofen causes less peptic ulceration than does aspirin. In patients with pain, the analgesic action of fenoprofen has produced a reduction in pain intensity, an increase in pain relief, improvement in total analgesia scores, and a sustained analgesic effect.Fenoprofen's exact mode of action is unknown, but it is thought that prostaglandin synthetase inhibition is involved. Fenoprofen has been shown to inhibit prostaglandin synthetase isolated from bovine seminal vesicles."
341,"Fenfluramine is indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome and  Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in patients aged two years and older.[L14522]Dravet syndrome is a pediatric encephalopathy that typically manifests within the first year of life following exposure to elevated temperatures. It is characterized by recurrent pharmacoresistant seizures, which increase in frequency and severity with disease progression. Concomitantly with these seizures, patients typically display delayed development and neurocognitive impairment.[A214694, A214709, A214712, A214715] Fenfluramine is a serotonergic phenethylamine originally used as an appetite suppressant until concerns regarding cardiotoxicity in obese patients lead to its withdrawal from the market in 1997.[A214694, A214718, A11906] Through its ability to modulate neurotransmission, fenfluramine has reemerged as an effective therapy against pharmacoresistant seizures, such as those involved in Dravet syndrome.[A214688, A214691, A214700]    Fenfluramine was granted initial FDA approval in 1973 prior to its withdrawal; it was granted a new FDA approval on June 25, 2020, for treatment of patients with Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome through the restricted FINTEPLA REMS program. It is currently sold under the name FINTEPLA® by Zogenix INC.[L14522]Fenfluramine increases extracellular serotonin levels, and also acts as both a serotonergic 5-HT2 receptor agonist and σ1 receptor antagonist. These activities, through an incompletely understood mechanism, lead to anti-epileptiform activity and therapeutic benefit.[A214682, A214685, A214688, A28641, A214691, A214694, A214697, A214700, L14522] This modulation has other effects such as decreased appetite, weight loss, sedation, lethargy, increased blood pressure, and mood alteration including possible suicidal ideation. There is a risk of glaucoma and potentially fatal serotonin syndrome. Fenfluramine should be gradually withdrawn following treatment alteration or cessation.[L14522]Dravet syndrome is a complex pediatric encephalopathy characterized by recurrent pharmacoresistant seizures of variable type, delayed development, and in many cases, impairment in speech, language, gait, and other neurocognitive functions.[A214694, A214709, A214712, A214715] Despite substantial variation in presentation and severity, roughly 80% of patients with Dravet syndrome have mutations in the _SCN1A_ gene, which encodes the alpha subunit of a voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav1.1).[A214685, A214688, A214691, A214700, A214709, A214715] This channel is predominantly localized in inhibitory GABAergic interneurons as well as in excitatory pyramidal neurons; it is thought that dysfunction of neurotransmission regulation results in the seizures and other corresponding symptoms of Dravet syndrome.[A214700, A214709]    Various _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ studies have demonstrated that fenfluramine is capable of acting as an agonist of multiple serotonin receptors including 5-HT1A, 5-HT1D, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C, as well as a σ1 receptor antagonist.[A214682, A214685, A214688, A28641, A214691, A214694, A214697, A214700, L14522] This is at least partly because fenfluramine, as well as its active metabolite norfenfluramine, can act on sodium-dependent serotonin transporters (SERTs) to reverse transport direction and thereby increase extracellular serotonin levels.[A214802, A214807] However, work in animal models of Dravet syndrome suggest that only the modulation of 5-HT1D, 5-HT2C, σ1, and possibly 5-HT2A receptors of fenfluramine result in the anti-epileptiform activity.[A214688, A214691, A214700] Interestingly, 5-HT2B receptor agonism, which had previously been associated with cardiac valvulopathy,[A214718, A11906] is not anticipated to have any therapeutic value in Dravet syndrome.[A214700]    Although the exact mechanism by which stimulation/inhibition of various receptors leads to the observed therapeutic benefit is unclear, it is hypothesized to be two-fold. Stimulation of 5-HT1D and 5-HT2C may result in increased GABAergic neurotransmission, while σ1 receptor antagonism may help to modulate responses to _N_-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA).[A214700] "

343,"For the treatment of urinary tract infectionA sulfathiazole antibacterial agent.Sulfamethizole is a sulfonamide antibiotic. The sulfonamides are synthetic bacteriostatic antibiotics with a wide spectrum against most gram-positive and many gram-negative organisms. However, many strains of an individual species may be resistant. Sulfonamides inhibit multiplication of bacteria by acting as competitive inhibitors ofp-aminobenzoic acid in the folic acid metabolism cycle. Bacterial sensitivity is the same for the various sulfonamides, and resistance to one sulfonamide indicates resistance to all. Most sulfonamides are readily absorbed orally. However, parenteral administration is difficult, since the soluble sulfonamide salts are highly alkaline and irritating to the tissues. The sulfonamides are widely distributed throughout all tissues. High levels are achieved in pleural, peritoneal, synovial, and ocular fluids. Although these drugs are no longer used to treat meningitis, CSF levels are high in meningeal infections. Their antibacterial action is inhibited by pus.Sulfamethizole is a competitive inhibitor of bacterial enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase. The normal para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) substrate is prevented from binding. The inhibited reaction is necessary in these organisms for the synthesis of folic acid."

Valaciclovir (valacyclovir), also known as _Valtrex_, is an antiviral drug that has been used to manage and treat various herpes infections for more than 2 decades.  It was initially approved by the FDA in 1995 [FDA label] and marketed by GlaxoSmithKline [L5671]. Valacyclovir is the L-valine ester of aciclovir. It is a member of the purine (guanine) nucleoside analog drug class [F3949].  This class of drugs forms an important part of hepatitis, HIV, and cytomegalovirus drug regimens [A175900].    One major use of valacyclovir is the treatment of genital herpes episodes or outbreaks. Genital herpes is a frequently diagnosed sexually transmitted disease which currently affects more than 400 million individuals worldwide. It is caused by infection with the herpes simplex virus (HSV). Infection with this virus is lifelong with periodic episodes of reactivation [A175903].**Antiviral effects**    Valacyclovir shows varying levels of inhibition towards herpes simplex virus types 1 (HSV-1), 2 (HSV-2), Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV). The quantitative relationship between the cell culture susceptibility of herpesviruses to antivirals and the clinical response of humans to the same antiviral therapy has not yet been elucidated. Sensitivity testing results, described by the concentration of drug needed to inhibit the growth of the virus by 50% in cell culture (EC50), vary widely depending on various factors [FDA label].    **Clinical study results**    For the various conditions below, clinical study results are summarized as follows [FDA label]:    _Cold sores_    Immunocompetent volunteers with cold sores were observed following the administration of a 1-day regimen (2 grams of valacyclovir twice a day for 1 day followed by one day of placebo) or a 2-day regimen (2 grams of valacyclovir twice daily for two days). The average duration of cold sore episodes was approximately 1 day shorter in treated subjects when compared to subjects treated with placebo. A 2-day drug administration regimen of valacyclovir did not provide superior benefit over the 1-day regimen. There was no clinically significant difference observed between subjects receiving valacyclovir or placebo in the prevention of progression of cold sore lesions after the papular stage, indicating that timing of valacyclovir administration is an important consideration [FDA label].    _Initial genital herpes episodes_    643 immunocompetent adults with first-episode genital herpes who presented within 72 hours of symptom onset were randomized in a double-blind trial to receive 10 days of valacyclovir 1 gram twice daily (n = 323) or oral acyclovir 200 mg 5 times a day (n = 320). In both groups, the median time to healing of herpetic lesions was measured to be 9 days, and the median time to cessation of pain was found to be 5 days, with the median time to cessation of viral shedding was approximately 3 days.    _Recurrent genital herpes episodes_    The results of 3 separate studies of patients taking  3 to 5-day regimens of valacyclovir showed an average of 4 days to lesion healing, 2-3 days to resolution of pain associated with the lesions, with an average of 2 days until the cessation of viral shedding [FDA label].  These findings showed valacyclovir administration to show superior beneficial effects when compared to the findings associated with placebo administration.     **A note on resistance**    The resistance of Herpes Simplex Virus and Varicella Zoster Virus to acyclovir can result from qualitative and quantitative changes in the viral TK and/or DNA polymerase. Clinical isolates of VZV with decreased susceptibility to acyclovir have been isolated from patients diagnosed with AIDS. A total of 522 TK-deficient mutants of VZV have been identified in these cases [FDA label]. Valacyclovir is the L-valine ester of aciclovir. It is classified as a nucleoside analog DNA polymerase enzyme inhibitor. Aciclovir is a purine (guanine) nucleoside analog is a metabolite that heavily contributes to the pharmacological actions of valacyclovir. In fact, most of valacyclovir's activity is attributed to  acyclovir [A175885].    Valacyclovir is rapidly and almost completely converted in man to aciclovir and valine, likely by the enzyme _valacyclovir hydrolase_.  Aciclovir is a selective inhibitor of the herpes viruses, possessing in vitro activity against herpes simplex viruses (HSV) type 1 and type 2, varicella zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), as well as human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6). Aciclovir has been shown to inhibit herpes virus DNA synthesis after it has been phosphorylated to the active triphosphate form [F3949].    The first stage of drug phosphorylation for acyclovir requires activation by a virus-specific enzyme. In the case of HSV, VZV and EBV this enzyme is the viral _thymidine kinase_ (TK), which is only found in virus-infected cells.  The process of phosphorylation is completed (conversion from mono- to triphosphate) by cellular kinases. Acyclovir triphosphate competitively inhibits the virus DNA polymerase and incorporation of this agent results in DNA chain termination, stopping virus DNA synthesis and blocking virus replication [F3949]. The inhibitory capabilities of acyclovir are highly selective due to the drug's strong affinity for _thymidine kinase_ (TK)[FDA label].      In summary, the antiviral effects of valacyclovir are achieved in 3 ways [FDA label]:     1) competitive inhibition of viral DNA polymerase    2) incorporation and termination of the growing viral DNA chain    3) inactivation of the viral DNA polymerase. The higher level of antiviral activity of acyclovir against HSV compared with VZV is attributed to its more efficient phosphorylation by viral thymidine kinase (TK)."
345,"For the treatment of acute and chronic infections of the upper and lower urinary tract and in asymptomatic bacteriuria due to susceptible strains of bacteria.Broad-spectrum semisynthetic penicillin derivative used parenterally. It is susceptible to gastric juice and penicillinase and may damage platelet function.Carbenicillin is a semisynthetic penicillin. Though carbenicillin provides substantial in vitro activity against a variety of both gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms, the most important aspect of its profile is in its antipseudomonal and antiproteal activity. Because of the high urine levels obtained following administration, carbenicillin has demonstrated clinical efficacy in urinary infections due to susceptible strains of: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris,Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas species, Providencia rettgeri, Enterobacter species, and Enterococci (S. faecalis).Free carbenicillin is the predominant pharmacologically active fraction of the salt. Carbenicillin exerts its antibacterial activity by interference with final cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. Penicillins acylate the penicillin-sensitive transpeptidase C-terminal domain by opening the lactam ring. This inactivation of the enzyme prevents the formation of a cross-link of two linear peptidoglycan strands, inhibiting the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that carbenicillin interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."
346,"Used in short-term (a few weeks) treatment of exogenous obesity in conjunction with a regimen of weight reduction based on caloric restriction, exercise, and behavior modification in patients with a body mass index of 30 kg of body weight per height in meters squared (kg/m2) or in patients with a body mass index of 27 kg/m2 in the presence of risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia.Mazindol is a tricyclic anorexigenic agent that is unrelated to and less toxic than [amphetamine], but with some similar side effects. It inhibits uptake of catecholamines and blocks the binding of cocaine to the dopamine uptake transporter. Mazindol is only approved in the United States for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and is not marketed or available in the United States for use in the treatment of obesity.Mazindol is a sympathomimetic amine that stimulates the central nervous system (nerves and brain), leading to increased your heart rate and blood pressure, and decreased appetite. Since the appetite-suppressing effect of the drug tends to decrease after few weeks of treatment, sympathomimetic appetite suppressants are typically used short-term weight-loss program. Unlike other sympathomimetic appetite suppressants such as phentermine, mazindol is thought to inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine rather than to cause its release."
347,"Lactulose is indicated for use as a laxative in the treatment of chronic constipation in adults and geriatric patients.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202]    Additionally, lactulose is also employed as an adjunct to protein restriction and supportive therapy for the prevention and treatment of portal-systemic encephalopathy (PSE), including both the hepatic pre-coma and coma variations.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] In particular, lactulose solution has been effective at managing PSE resulting from surgical portacaval shunts or from chronic hepatic diseases like cirrhosis.[L6199]    Moreover, there have also been studies demonstrating the capacity for lactulose to minimize the formation of gallstones and even some investigations regarding the experimental use of the agent in developing novel anticancer agents owing to its ability to bind galactin carbohydrates involved in various tumor progressions [L6202].Lactulose is a synthetic disaccharide derivative of lactose that is most commonly used as a laxative agent despite also being formally indicated to serve as an adjunct therapy in treating portal-systemic encephalopathy (PSE).[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] Despite being first synthesized in 1929[A178081], investigations regarding its possible use as a laxative for the treatment of chronic constipation did not occur until the 1960s and its first clinical use for treating PSE was not until 1966.[L6202]     Nevertheless, although lactulose received formal FDA approval in 1977 and has since become a readily available generic and brand-name non-prescription medication listed on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines as one of the most effective and safe medicines employed in a health system[L6205], data regarding its optimal place in therapy is often ambiguous.[L6202]    Especially considering the use of lactulose as a laxative is typically only considered after lifestyle and dietary modifications fail and the fact that lactulose therapy cannot be ethically withheld from patients diagnosed with PSE in a placebo study, the substance may just be one of many options available for treating constipation and its efficacy in managing PSE may never be formally confirmed or refuted via clinical investigation.[L6202]Lactulose formulations are most commonly administered via the oral route or the rectal route.[L6202] Consequently, because the substance experiences minimal absorption by the gut it typically remains localized in the gastrointestinal tract environment and ultimately demonstrates almost all of its pharmacologic effects within the gut.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] In particular, as lactulose elicits its laxative effects in enhancing stool amounts and softening stool, such biochemical and physiologic activities can cause increased bowel sounds (borborygmi), a feeling of bloatedness, belching, frequent flatus, and diarrhea.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202]   Lactulose is a synthetic disaccharide derivative of lactose that consists of one molecule of galactose and one molecule of fructose.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] Saccharolytic bacteria present in the large intestine subsequently break the substance down into organic acids like lactic acid and small amounts of formic and acetic acids.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] Such resultant volatile fatty acid metabolites, in combination with hydrogen and methane that is also generated consequently enhance intraluminal gas formation, peristaltic gut motility, and elicit an osmotic effect that facilitates an increase in the water content of stool as well as associated stool softening.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] All of these actions ultimately assist in facilitating and increasing the frequency of bowel movements in patients experiencing constipation, although it may take 24 to 48 hours after using the medication for this laxative effect to become evident.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202]    At the same time, the formation of such acids via the metabolism of lactulose by colonic bacteria also acidifies the contents of the colon, thereby contributing to the treatment of portal-systemic encephalopathy (PSE).[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] As one of the principal features of PSE involves the accumulation of nitrogenous waste products like ammonia in the systemic circulation, a state in which the colonic contents become more acidic than blood allows ammonia in the circulation to diffuse into the colon.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202]. Furthermore, ammonia that diffuses into the acidic colon is ionized to ammonium ions that are incapable of being absorbed back into the blood.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] These effects, combined with the laxative action of lactulose facilitates the excretion of excess ammonia.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] And finally, it is also believed that an acidic colonic environment results in the elimination of urease-producing bacteria that contribute to the formation of ammonia while surviving colonic bacteria use up any trapped ammonia in the colon as a source of nitrogen for protein synthesis.[L6202]"
348,"For the treatment of esophageal candidiasis, cadidemia, invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, and serious fungal infections caused by Scedosporium apiospermum and Fusarium spp.[L9821, L15571] Voriconazole (Vfend, Pfizer) is a triazole antifungal medication used to treat serious fungal infections.[L15571] It is used to treat invasive fungal infections that are generally seen in patients who are immunocompromised. These include invasive candidiasis, invasive aspergillosis, and emerging fungal infections. The increased affinity of voriconazole for 14-alpha sterol demethylase makes it useful against some [fluconazole]-resistant organisms.[A236050]    Voriconazole was approved by the FDA under the trade name Vfend on May 24, 2002.[L34660]Voriconazole is a fungistatic triazole antifungal used to treat infections by inhibiting fungal growth.[L9821] It is known to cause hepatotoxic and photosensitivity reactions in some patients.Voriconazole is used to treat fungal infections caused by a variety of organisms but including _Aspergillus spp._ and _Candida spp_. Voriconazole is a triazole antifungal exhibiting fungistatic activity against fungal pathogens.[A236050, A236045, L9821] Like other triazoles, voriconazole binds to 14-alpha sterol demethylase, also known as CYP51, and inhibits the demethylation of lanosterol as part of the ergosterol synthesis pathway in yeast and other fungi. The lack of sufficient ergosterol disrupts fungal cell membrane function and limits fungal cell growth. With fungal growth limited, the host's immune system is able to clear the invading organism."
349,"For treatment of primary systemic carnitine deficiency, a genetic impairment of normal biosynthesis or utilization of levocarnitine from dietary sources, or for the treatment of secondary carnitine deficiency resulting from an inborn error of metabolism such as glutaric aciduria II, methyl malonic aciduria, propionic acidemia, and medium chain fatty acylCoA dehydrogenase deficiency. Used therapeutically to stimulate gastric and pancreatic secretions and in the treatment of hyperlipoproteinemias. Parenteral levocarnitine is indicated for the prevention and treatment of carnitine deficiency in patients with end-stage renal disease.Constituent of striated muscle and liver. It is used therapeutically to stimulate gastric and pancreatic secretions and in the treatment of hyperlipoproteinemias.Levocarnitine is a carrier molecule in the transport of long chain fatty acids across the inner mitochondrial membrane. It also exports acyl groups from subcellular organelles and from cells to urine before they accumulate to toxic concentrations. Lack of carnitine can lead to liver, heart, and muscle problems. Carnitine deficiency is defined biochemically as abnormally low plasma concentrations of free carnitine, less than 20 &micro;mol/L at one week post term and may be associated with low tissue and/or urine concentrations. Further, this condition may be associated with a plasma concentration ratio of acylcarnitine/levocarnitine greater than 0.4 or abnormally elevated concentrations of acylcarnitine in the urine. Only the L isomer of carnitine (sometimes called vitamin BT) affects lipid metabolism. The ""vitamin BT"" form actually contains D,L-carnitine, which competitively inhibits levocarnitine and can cause deficiency. Levocarnitine can be used therapeutically to stimulate gastric and pancreatic secretions and in the treatment of hyperlipoproteinemias.Levocarnitine can be synthesised within the body from the amino acids lysine or methionine. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is essential to the synthesis of carnitine. Levocarnitine is a carrier molecule in the transport of long chain fatty acids across the inner mitochondrial membrane. It also exports acyl groups from subcellular organelles and from cells to urine before they accumulate to toxic concentrations. Only the L isomer of carnitine (sometimes called vitamin BT) affects lipid metabolism. Levocarnitine is handled by several proteins in different pathways including carnitine transporters, carnitine translocases, carnitine acetyltransferases and carnitine palmitoyltransferases."
350,"Indicated for the management of essential or renovascular hypertension [L6586] as monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensive agents, such as thiazide diuretics, for an additive effect.[label]    Indicated for the treatment of symptomatic congestive heart failure, usually in combination with diuretics and digitalis.[label]    Indicated for the management of asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction in patients with an ejection fraction of �?to 35 percent to decrease the rate of development of overt heart failure and the incidence of hospitalization for heart failure.[label]Enalapril is a prodrug belonging to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor drug class that works on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which is responsible for the regulation of blood pressure and fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. Enalapril is an orally-active and long-acting nonsulphydryl antihypertensive agent that suppresses the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to lower blood pressure. It was developed from a targeted research programmed using molecular modelling.[A18459] Being a prodrug, enalapril is rapidly biotransformed into its active metabolite, [enalaprilat], which is responsible for the pharmacological actions of enalapril. The active metabolite of enalapril competitively inhibits the ACE to hinder the production of angiotensin II, a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system that promotes vasoconstriction and renal reabsorption of sodium ions in the kidneys. Ultimately, enalaprilat works to reduce blood pressure and blood fluid volume.    Commonly marketed under the trade name Vasotec, enalapril was first approved by the FDA in 1985 for the management of hypertension, heart failure, and asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. It is also found in a combination product containing [hydrochlorothiazide] that is used for the management of hypertension. The active metabolite enalaprilat is also available in oral tablets and intravenous formulations for injection.Enalapril is an antihypertensive agent that exhibits natriuretic and uricosuric properties. Enalapril lowers blood pressure in all grades of essential and renovascular hypertension, and peripheral vascular resistance without causing an increase in heart rate.[A179137] Individuals with low-renin hypertensive population were still responsive to enalapril.[label] The duration of hypertensive effect in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure persists for at least 24 hours following initial administration of a single oral dose, and repeated daily administration of enalapril confers an additional reduction in blood pressure and a steady-state antihypertensive response may take several weeks.[A179140] In patients with severe congestive heart failure and inadequate clinical response to conventional antihypertensive therapies, treatment with enalapril resulted in improvements in cardiac performance as observed by a reduction in both preload and afterload, and improved clinical status long-term.[A179137] Furthermore, enalapril was shown to increase cardiac output and stroke volume while decreasing pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in patients with congestive heart failure refractory to conventional treatment with digitalis and diuretics. In clinical studies, enalapril reduced left ventricular mass, and did not affect cardiac function or myocardial perfusion during exercise.[A179134] Enalapril is not highly associated with the risk of bradycardia unlike most diuretics and beta-blockers [A179137] and it does not produce rebound hypertension upon discontinuation of therapy.[A179134]     Enalapril is not reported to produce hypokalaemia, hyperglycaemia, hyperuricaemia or hypercholesterolaemia. In the kidneys, enalapril was shown to increase renal blood flow and decrease renal vascular resistance. It also augmented the glomerular filtration rate in patients with a glomerular filtration rate less than 80 mL/min.[A179134] When used in combination, enalapril was shown to attenuate the extent of drug-induced hypokalemia caused by hydrochlorothiazide [A179137] and the antihypertensive effects of both drugs were potentiated.[A18459]The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a signaling pathway that works in synergism with the sympathetic system to regulate blood pressure and fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. Activation of this system upon stimulation by different factors, such as low blood pressure and nerve impulses, leads to increased release of norepinephrine (NE) from sympathetic nerve terminals and effects on the vascular growth, vasoconstriction, and salt retention in the kidneys.[T28] Renin is released from   Renin acts on the precursor prottein angiotensinogen, which is a plasma globulin synthesized from the liver, to produce cleaved peptide hormone angiotensin I.[T28] Angiotensin I then can be further cleaved by ACE to produce angiotensin II, a vasoconstrictive peptide hormone.[label] Present in different isoforms, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is peptidyl dipeptidase enzyme expressed in various tissues, including the vascular tissues, such as the heart, brain, and kidneys.[T28] ACE also plays a role in inactivation of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide.[T28,label] Angiotensin II mediates various actions on the body by working on its G-protein coupled receptors, AT1 and AT2.[T28] It causes direct vasoconstriction of precapillary arterioles and postcapillary venules, inhibits the reuptake of NE thereby increasing available levels, stimulates the release of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla, reduces urinary excretion of sodium ions and water by promoting proximal tubular reabsorption, stimulates synthesis and release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex, and stimulates hypertrophy of both vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiac myocytes.[L6619]    Enalapril is a pharmacologically inactive prodrug that requires hepatic biotransformation to form [enalaprilat], its active metabolite that works on the RAAS to inhibit ACE.[label] Biotransformation is critial for the therapeutic actions of the drug, as enalapril itself is only a weak inhibitor of ACE.[A179131] ACE inhibition results in reduced production and plasma levels of angiotensin II, increased plasma renin activity due to the loss of feedback inhibition by angiotensin II, and decreased aldosterone secretion.[L6586] However, plasma aldosterone levels usually return to normal during long-term administration of enalapril.[A179140] Decreased levels of angiotensin II subsequently leads to the dilatation of peripheral vessles and reduced vascular resistance which in turn lower blood pressure.[A179140] While inhibition of ACE leading to suppression of RAAS is thought to be the primary mechanism of action of enalapril, the drug was shown to still exert antihypertensive effects on individuals with low-renin hypertension. It is suggested that enalapril may mediate its pharmacological actions via other modes of action that are not fully understood.[label] As ACE is structurally similar to kininase I, which is a carboxypeptidase that degrades bradykinin, whether increased levels of bradykinin play a role in the therapeutic effects of enalapril remains to be elucidated.[label]"
351,"For the treatment of acid-reflux disorders (GERD), peptic ulcer disease, active benign gastric ulcer, and active duodenal ulcer.A histamine H2 receptor antagonist with low toxicity that inhibits gastric acid secretion. The drug is used for the treatment of duodenal ulcers.Nizatidine is a competitive, reversible inhibitor of histamine at the histamine H2-receptors, particularly those in the gastric parietal cells. By inhibiting the action of histamine on stomach cells, nizatidine reduces stomach acid production. Nizatidine had no demonstrable antiandrogenic action. Full-dose therapy for the problems treated by nizatidine lasts no longer than 8 weeks. It has been demonstrated that treatment with a reduced dose of nizatidine is effective as maintenance therapy following healing of active duodenal ulcers.Nizatidine competes with histamine for binding at the H2-receptors on the gastric basolateral membrane of parietal cells. Competitive inhibition results in reduction of basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretions. The drug also decreases the gastric acid response to stimuli such as food, caffeine, insulin, betazole, or pentagastrin."
352,"Diclofenac is indicated for use in the treatment of pain and inflammation from varying sources including inflammatory conditions such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, as well as injury-related inflammation due to surgery and physical trauma. Diclofenac is a phenylacetic acid derivative and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).[label] NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and-2 which are the enzyme responsible for producing prostaglandins (PGs). PGs contribute to inflammation and pain signalling. Diclofenac, like other NSAIDs, is often used as first line therapy for acute and chronic pain and inflammation from a variety of causes. Diclofenac was the product of rational drug design based on the structures of [phenylbutazone], [mefenamic acid], and [indomethacin].[A180796] The addition of two chlorine groups in the ortho position of the phenyl ring locks the ring in maximal torsion which appears to be related to increased potency. Diclofenac was first approved by the FDA in July 1988 under the trade name Voltaren, marketed by Novartis (previously Ciba-Geigy).[L7360]Diclofenac reduces inflammation and by extension reduces nociceptive pain and combats fever.[label,T116] It also increases the risk of developing a gastrointestinal ulcer by inhibiting the production of protective mucus in the stomach.Diclofenac inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 and -2, the enzymes responsible for production of prostaglandin (PG) G2 which is the precursor to other PGs.[label,T116] These molecules have broad activity in pain and inflammation and the inhibition of their production is the common mechanism linking each effect of diclofenac.    PGE2is the primary PG involved in modulation of nociception.[A179023] It mediates peripheral sensitization through a variety of effects.[T116,A179023] PGE2 activates the Gq-coupled EP1 receptor leading to increased activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C pathway. Activation of this pathway releases intracellular stores of calcium which directly reduces action potential threshold and activates protein kinase C (PKC) which contributes to several indirect mechanisms. PGE2 also activates the EP4 receptor, coupled to Gs, which activates the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (AC/PKA) signaling pathway. PKA and PKC both contribute to the potentiation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) potentiation, which increases sensitivity to heat stimuli. They also activate tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels and inhibit inward potassium currents. PKA further contributes to the activation of the P2X3 purine receptor and sensitization of T-type calcium channels. The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents. PGE2 act via EP3 to increase sensitivity to bradykinin and via EP2 to further increase heat sensitivity. Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EP2 receptor which couples to Gs. Pre-synaptically, this receptor increases the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate, CGRP, and substance P. Post-synaptically it increases the activity of AMPA and NMDA receptors and produces inhibition of inhibitory glycinergic neurons. Together these lead to a reduced threshold of activating, allowing low intensity stimuli to generate pain signals. PGI2 is known to play a role via its Gs-coupled IP receptor although the magnitude of its contribution varies. It has been proposed to be of greater importance in painful inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. By limiting sensitization, both peripheral and central, via these pathways NSAIDs can effectively reduce inflammatory pain.    PGI2 and PGE2 contribute to acute inflammation via their IP and EP2 receptors.[T116,A179044] Similarly to β adrenergic receptors these are Gs-coupled and mediate vasodilation through the AC/PKA pathway. PGE2 also contributes by increasing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and attracts the cells to the site of injury.[T116] PGD2 plays a role in the activation of endothelial cell release of cytokines through its DP1 receptor.[A179044] PGI2 and PGE2 modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation through IP, EP2, and EP4 receptors which is believed to be an important activity in the pathology of arthritic conditions. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation.    PGE2 can cross the blood-brain barrier and act on excitatory Gq EP3 receptors on thermoregulatory neurons in the hypothalamus.[T116] This activation triggers an increase in heat-generation and a reduction in heat-loss to produce a fever. NSAIDs prevent the generation of PGE2 thereby reducing the activity of these neurons.  "

Lisuride is an anti-Parkinson drug chemically related to the dopaminergic ergoline Parkinson's drugs. Lisuride binds to the 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A/2C) receptors.  It is also thought to bind to the dopamine receptor and to act as a dopamine agonist. Evidence has also emerged that Lisuride also binds to the Histamine H1 receptor. "
355,"Doxazosin is indicated to treat the symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy, which may include urinary frequency, urgency, and nocturia, among other symptoms.[L7282] Off-label uses of doxazosin include the treatment of pediatric hypertension[A180634] and the treatment of ureteric calculi.[A180637]Doxazosin is an alpha-1 antagonist used for the treatment of benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) symptoms and hypertension. Other members of this drug class include [Prazosin], [Terazosin], [Tamsulosin], and [Alfuzosin].[A180661]  Because of its long-lasting effects, doxazosin can be administered once a day.[A180649] It is marketed by Pfizer and was initially approved by the FDA in 1990.[L7285]Doxazosin decreases standing and supine blood pressure[A180649] and relieves the symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy through the inhibition of alpha-1 receptors.  Doxazosin may cause hypotension due to its pharmacological actions. This frequently occurs in the upright position, leading to a feeling of dizziness or lightheadedness. The first dose of doxazosin may lead to such effects, however, subsequent doses may also cause them. The risk of these effects is particularly high when dose adjustments occur or there are long intervals between doxazosin doses. Treatment should be started with the 1 mg dose of doxazosin, followed by slow titration to the appropriate dose.[L7282] Patients must be advised of this risk and to avoid situations in which syncope and dizziness could be hazardous following the ingestion of doxazosin.[L7282] Interestingly doxazosin exerts beneficial effects on plasma lipids. It reduces LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol and triglyceride levels and increases HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol levels.[A180649]    A note on priapism risk    In rare cases, doxazosin and other alpha-1 blockers may cause priapism, a painful occurrence of persistent and unrelievable penile erection that can lead to impotence if medical attention is not sought as soon as possible. Patients must be advised of the priapism risk associated with doxazosin and to seek medical attention immediately if it is suspected.[A180670,L7282]Doxazosin selectively inhibits the postsynaptic alpha-1 receptors on vascular smooth muscle by nonselectively blocking the alpha-1a, alpha-1b, and alpha-1d subtypes[A180688,A4649]. This action on blood vessels decreases systemic peripheral vascular resistance, reducing blood pressure, exerting minimal effects on the heart rate due to its receptor selectivity.[A180649,A180676] Norepinephrine-activated alpha-1 receptors located on the prostate gland and bladder neck normally cause contraction of regional muscular tissue, obstructing urinary flow and contributing to the symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy.  Alpha-1 antagonism causes smooth muscle relaxation in the prostate and bladder, effectively relieving urinary frequency, urgency, weak urinary stream, and other unpleasant effects of BPH.[A180655] Recently, doxazosin was found to cause apoptosis of hERG potassium channels in an in vitro setting, possibly contributing to a risk of heart failure with doxazosin use.[A15296,A180697,A180700] "
356,"Fluocinolone acetonide has been used extensively in different medical areas.    -In dermatology, it is extensively used for the relief of inflammatory dermatosis, dermatitis, psoriasis, hypertrophic tissues, keloid tissues and atopic dermatitis.[F1955]    -It has been used in shampoo products as a low to medium potency corticosteroid for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp.[L4682]    -In ear drops, it is used as a low to medium potency corticosteroid for the treatment of chronic eczematous external otitis in adults and pediatric patients 2 years and older.[L4683]    -As an intravitreal implant, it is indicated for the treatment of diabetic macular edema with patients that have been previously treated with a course of corticosteroids and no clinically significant rise in intraocular pressure.[L4684]    -Fluocinolone acetonide was announced on October 15, 2018 to be FDA approved for the treatment of chronic non-infectious uveitis affecting the posterior segment of the eye.[L4685]    -Some reports have indicated the use of fluocinolone acetonide as a vasoprotective agent and for its use in the treatment of first-degree hemorrhoids.[A39532]Fluocinolone acetonide, with the formula 6-alpha, 9-alpha-difluoro-16-alpha, 17 alpha-acetonide, is a corticosteroid that presents a high lipophilicity.[T357] It has been used extensively in dermatological preparations and it has also been investigated thoroughly for its use in implantable corticosteroid devices.[T358] This type of device containing fluocinolone acetonide was developed by Taro Pharmaceuticals and approved by FDA in May 2016.[L4676]Fluocinolone acetonide is a synthetic anti-inflammatory corticosteroid and thus, the effect of its interaction with the body produces vasoconstriction and suppression of membrane permeability, mitotic activity, immune response and release of inflammatory mediators.[F1956]    For its ophthalmic indications, fluocinolone acetonide is administered as intravitreal micro-insert. This preparation was observed in clinical trials to reduce the recurrence of uveitis flares by 2 fold when compared with the non treated patients even after six months after initial administration. As well the intraocular pressure seemed to increase slightly with the presence of the fluocinolone implant but it is important to monitor intraocular pressure.[L4685]Fluocinolone acetonide is a corticosteroid and thus, it can be inferred that it acts by inhibiting the edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, collagen deposition, and scar formation.[F1957]     Some reports have indicated that fluocinolone acetonide presents a high binding affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor. After binding the receptor, the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements in the promoter region of the target genes.[A16592] This effect promotes the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins (lipocortins). Through this mechanism of action, it is thought that fluocinolone induces mainly one of the lipocortins, annexin 1, which will later mediate the synthesis of inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of arachidonic acid which is the precursor of all these inflammatory mediators. Hence, the induction of these proteins will prevent the release of arachidonic acid by phospholipase A2.[F1957]"
357,"Used as alternative treatment for ascariasis caused by Ascaris lumbricoides (roundworm) and enterobiasis (oxyuriasis) caused by Enterobius vermicularis(pinworm). It is also used to treat partial intestinal obstruction by the common roundworm, a condition primarily occurring in children.Piperazine is an organic compound that consists of a six-membered ring containing two opposing nitrogen atoms. First used as a solvent for uric acid, the use of piperazine as an anthelmintic agent was first introduced in 1953. Upon entry into the systemic circulation, the drug is partly oxidized and partly eliminated as an unchanged compound. Outside the body, piperazine has a remarkable power to dissolve uric acid and producing a soluble urate, but in clinical experience it has not proved equally successful. Piperazine was first introduced as an anthelmintic in 1953. Piperazine compounds mediate their anthelmintic action by generally paralyzing parasites, allowing the host body to easily remove or expel the invading organism.Piperazine is an anthelminthic especially useful in the treatment of partial intestinal obstruction caused by Ascaris worms, which is a condition primarily seen in children. Piperazine hydrate and piperazine citrate are the main anthelminthic piperazines.Piperazine is a GABA receptor agonist. Piperzine binds directly and selectively to muscle membrane GABA receptors, presumably causing hyperpolarization of nerve endings, resulting in flaccid paralysis of the worm. While the worm is paralyzed, it is dislodged from the intestinal lumen and expelled live from the body by normal intestinal peristalsis."
358,"For the treatment of petit mal epilepsy.An anticonvulsant especially useful in the treatment of absence seizures unaccompanied by other types of seizures.Used in the treatment of epilepsy. Ethosuximide suppresses the paroxysmal three cycle per second spike and wave activity associated with lapses of consciousness which is common in absence (petit mal) seizures. The frequency of epileptiform attacks is reduced, apparently by depression of the motor cortex and elevation of the threshold of the central nervous system to convulsive stimuli.Binds to T-type voltage sensitive calcium channels. Voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) mediate the entry of calcium ions into excitable cells and are also involved in a variety of calcium-dependent processes, including muscle contraction, hormone or neurotransmitter release, gene expression, cell motility, cell division and cell death. The isoform alpha-1G gives rise to T-type calcium currents. T-type calcium channels belong to the ""low-voltage activated (LVA)"" group and are strongly blocked by mibefradil. A particularity of this type of channels is an opening at quite negative potentials and a voltage-dependent inactivation. T-type channels serve pacemaking functions in both central neurons and cardiac nodal cells and support calcium signaling in secretory cells and vascular smooth muscle. They may also be involved in the modulation of firing patterns of neurons which is important for information processing as well as in cell growth processes."
359,"For use as adjunctive treatment with thiazide diuretics or other kaliuretic-diuretic agents in congestive heart failure or hypertension.A pyrazine compound inhibiting sodium reabsorption through sodium channels in renal epithelial cells. This inhibition creates a negative potential in the luminal membranes of principal cells, located in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct. Negative potential reduces secretion of potassium and hydrogen ions. Amiloride is used in conjunction with diuretics to spare potassium loss. (From Gilman et al., Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 9th ed, p705)Amiloride, an antikaliuretic-diuretic agent, is a pyrazine-carbonyl-guanidine that is unrelated chemically to other known antikaliuretic or diuretic agents. It is an antihypertensive, potassium-sparing diuretic that was first approved for use in 1967 and helps to treat hypertension and congestive heart failure. The drug is often used in conjunction with thiazide or loop diuretics. Due to its potassium-sparing capacities, hyperkalemia (high blood potassium levels) are occasionally observed in patients taking amiloride. The risk is high in concurrent use of ACE inhibitors or spironolactone. Patients are also advised not to use potassium-containing salt replacements.Amiloride works by inhibiting sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts in the kidneys by binding to the amiloride-sensitive sodium channels. This promotes the loss of sodium and water from the body, but without depleting potassium. Amiloride exerts its potassium sparing effect through the inhibition of sodium reabsorption at the distal convoluted tubule, cortical collecting tubule and collecting duct; this decreases the net negative potential of the tubular lumen and reduces both potassium and hydrogen secretion and their subsequent excretion. Amiloride is not an aldosterone antagonist and its effects are seen even in the absence of aldosterone."
360,"Labetalol injections are indicated to control blood pressure in severe hypertension.[L7730]Labetalol is a racemic mixture of 2 diastereoisomers where dilevalol, the R,R' stereoisomer, makes up 25% of the mixture.[L7730] Labetalol is formulated as an injection or tablets to treat hypertension.[L7727,L7730]    Labetalol was granted FDA approval on 1 August 1984.[L7724]Labetalol antagonizes various adrenergic receptors to decrease blood pressure.[A181901,A181907,A181910,L7727] The duration of action is long as it is generally given twice daily, and the therapeutic window is wide as patients usually take 200-400mg twice daily.[L7730] Patients susceptible to bronchospasms should not use labetalol unless they are unresponsive to or intolerant of other antihypertensives.[L7730]Labetalol non-selectively antagonizes beta-adrenergic receptors, and selectively antagonizes alpha-1-adrenergic receptors.[A181901] Following oral administration, labetalol has 3 times the beta-blocking ability than alpha-blocking ability.[A181901] This increases to 6.9 times following intravenous administration.[A181901] Antagonism of alpha-1-adrenergic receptors leads to vasodilation and decreased vascular resistance.[A181907] This leads to a decrease in blood pressure that is most pronounced while standing.[A181910] Antagonism of beta-1-adrenergic receptors leads to a slight decrease in heart rate.[L7727] Antagonism of beta-2-adrenergic receptors leads to some of the side effects of labetalol such as bronchospasms, however this may be slightly attenuated by alpha-1-adrenergic antagonism.[A181910] Labetalol leads to sustained vasodilation over the long term without a significant decrease in cardiac output or stroke volume, and a minimal decrease in heart rate.[A181907,A181910]"
361,"Linezolid is indicated in adults and children for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible Gram-positive bacteria, including nosocomial pneumonia, community-acquired pneumonia, skin and skin structure infections, and vancomycin-resistant _Enterococcus faecium_ infections.[L32965] Examples of susceptible bacteria include _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, _Streptococcus pyogenes_, and _Streptococcus agalactiae_.[L32965]    Linezolid is not indicated for the treatment of Gram-negative infections, nor has it been evaluated for use longer than 28 days.[L32965]Linezolid is a synthetic antibiotic which is used for the treatment of infections caused by aerobic Gram-positive bacteria. Its effects are bacteriostatic against both enterococci and staphylococci and bactericidal against most isolates of streptococci.[L32965] Linezolid exerts its antibacterial activity by inhibiting the initiation of bacterial protein synthesis - more specifically, it binds to the 23S ribosomal RNA of the 50S subunit[A11227,A199050] and, in doing so, prevents the formation of the 70S initiation complex which is essential for bacterial reproduction.    Linezolid was initially approved in 2000 and was the first member of the oxazolidinone antibiotic class.[A233425] A second member of this class, [tedizolid], was approved by the FDA in 2014 and is considered generally more effective and tolerable than its predecessor.Linezolid is an oxazolidinone antibacterial agent effective against most strains of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria and mycobacteria. It appears to be bacteriostatic against both staphylococci and enterococci and bactericidal against most isolates of streptococci.[L32965] Linezolid has shown some _in vitro_ activity against Gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria but is not considered efficacious against these organisms.[L32965]    Linezolid is a reversible and non-selective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzymes and can therefore contribute to the development of serotonin syndrome when administered alongside serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs).[L32965] Linezolid should not be used for the treatment of catheter-related bloodstream infections or catheter-site infections, as the risk of therapy appears to outweigh its benefits under these circumstances.[L32965]Linezolid exerts its antibacterial effects by interfering with bacterial protein translation.[A233035] It binds to a site on the bacterial 23S ribosomal RNA of the 50S subunit and prevents the formation of a functional 70S initiation complex, which is essential for bacterial reproduction, thereby preventing bacteria from dividing.[L32965]    Point mutations in the bacterial 23S rRNA can lead to linezolid resistance, and the development of linezolid-resistant _Enterococcus faecium_ and _Staphylococcus aureus_ have been documented during its clinical use.[L32965] As antimicrobial susceptibility patterns are geographically distinct, local antibiograms should be consulted to ensure adequate coverage of relevant pathogens prior to use."
362,"Administered topically, ivermectin cream is indicated for the treatment of inflammatory lesions associated with rosacea.[L36753] An over-the-counter ivermection lotion is commercially available and indicated for the topical treatment of head lice infestations in patients �? months of age.[L36748]    Orally administered ivermectin is indicated as a broad-spectrum anti-parasitic for the treatment of intestinal strongyloidiasis caused by _Strongyloides stercoralis_ and onchocerciasis caused by _Onchocerca volvulus_.[L31453] Systemic ivermectin therapy is used internationally for the treatment of various tropical diseases, including filariasis, cutaneous larva migrans, and _Loa loa_ infection, amongst others.[A238298]Ivermectin is a semi-synthetic antiparasitic medication derived from avermectins, a class of highly-active broad-spectrum antiparasitic agents isolated from the fermentation products of _Streptomyces avermitilis_.[L31453] Ivermectin itself is a mixture of two avermectins, comprising roughly 90% 5-O-demethyl-22,23-dihydroavermectin A1a (22,23-dihydroavermectin B1a) and 10% 5-O-demethyl-25-de(1-methylpropyl)-22,23-dihydro­-25-(1-methylethyl)avermectin A1a (22,23-dihydroavermectin B1b).[L31453]    Ivermectin is mainly used in humans in the treatment of onchocerciasis, but may also be effective against other worm infestations (such as strongyloidiasis, ascariasis, trichuriasis and enterobiasis). Applied topically, it may be used in the treatment of head lice infestation.    With the advent of 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic, ivermectin began garnering notoriety due to its off-label use for the prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19. While studies are still ongoing, much of the evidence for ivermectin in COVID-19 relies on pre-print _in vitro_ data, and the clinical utility of this data remains unclear. Due to a number of factors - for example, the relatively low number of patients per trial and the speed at which these trials were conducted - studies on the use of ivermectin in COVID-19 have been fraught with statistical errors and accusations of plagiarism.[L36763,A238929] In addition, the use of aggregate patient data in large-scale meta-analyses (as opposed to individual patient data (IPD)) has been shown to disguise otherwise blatant data errors, such as extreme terminal digit bias and the duplication of blocks of patient records.[A238929]      Until high-quality, peer-reviewed data regarding both the safety and efficacy of ivermectin for COVID-19 in humans becomes available, the use of ivermectin for these purposes should be avoided in favour of thoroughly-vetted therapies (e.g. COVID-19 vaccines like [Comirnaty](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB15696)).Ivermectin is a semisynthetic, anthelminitic agent. It is an avermectin, a group of pentacyclic sixteen-membered lactones (i.e. a macrocyclic lactone disaccharide) derived from the soil bacterium _Streptomyces avermitilis_. Avermectins are potent and broad-spectrum anti-parasitic agents.Ivermectin binds selectively and with high affinity to glutamate-gated chloride ion channels in invertebrate muscle and nerve cells of the microfilaria. This binding causes an increase in the permeability of the cell membrane to chloride ions and results in hyperpolarization of the cell, leading to paralysis and death of the parasite. Ivermectin also is believed to act as an agonist of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), thereby disrupting GABA-mediated central nervous system (CNS) neurosynaptic transmission. Ivermectin may also impair normal intrauterine development of _O. volvulus_ microfilariae and may inhibit their release from the uteri of gravid female worms."

364,"For the symptomatic treatment of adult patients with nocturnal heartburn due to gastroesophageal reflux disease.In many countries (including Canada) cisapride has been either withdrawn or has had its indications limited due to reports about long QT syndrome due to cisapride, which predisposes to arrhythmias. The FDA issued a warning letter regarding this risk to health care professionals and patients.Cisapride is a parasympathomimetic which acts as a serotonin 5-HT<sub>4</sub> agonist; upon activation of the receptor signaling pathway, cisapride promotes the release of acetylcholine neurotransmitters in the enteric nervous system. Cisapride stimulates motility of the upper gastrointestinal tract without stimulating gastric, biliary, or pancreatic secretions. Cisapride increases the tone and amplitude of gastric (especially antral) contractions, relaxes the pyloric sphincter and the duodenal bulb, and increases peristalsis of the duodenum and jejunum resulting in accelerated gastric emptying and intestinal transit. It increases the resting tone of the lower esophageal sphincter. It has little, if any, effect on the motility of the colon or gallbladder. Cisapride does not induce muscarinic or nicotinic receptor stimulation, nor does it inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity.Cisapride acts through the stimulation of the serotonin 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors which increases acetylcholine release in the enteric nervous system (specifically the myenteric plexus). This results in increased tone and amplitude of gastric (especially antral) contractions, relaxation of the pyloric sphincter and the duodenal bulb, and increased peristalsis of the duodenum and jejunum resulting in accelerated gastric emptying and intestinal transit."
365,"For acute or long-term use in the relief of signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, acute painful shoulder (acute subacromial bursitis/supraspinatus tendinitis), and acute gouty arthritis.Sulindac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of the arylalkanoic acid class that is marketed by Merck under the brand name Clinoril. Like other NSAIDs, it may be used in the treatment of acute or chronic inflammatory conditions. Sulindac is a prodrug, derived from sulfinylindene, that is converted _in vivo_ to an active sulfide compound by liver enzymes. There is evidence from some studies that sulindac may be associated with fewer gastrointestinal side effects than other NSAIDs, except for the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor drug class. This may be due to the sulfide metabolite undergoing enterohepatic circulation thus maintaining constant blood levels of the compound without inducing gastrointestinal effects, where the drug is excreted in the bile and then reabsorbed from the intestines. While its full mechanism of action is not fully understood, sulindac is thought to primarily mediate its action by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2.Sulindac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory indene derivative, also possessing analgesic and antipyretic activities.Sulindac's exact mechanism of action is unknown. Its antiinflammatory effects are believed to be due to inhibition of both COX-1 and COX-2 which leads to the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. Antipyretic effects may be due to action on the hypothalamus, resulting in an increased peripheral blood flow, vasodilation, and subsequent heat dissipation."
366,"Cyclothiazide is indicated as adjunctive therapy in edema associated with congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, and corticosteroid and estrogen therapy. It is also indicated in the management of hypertension either as the sole therapeutic agent or to enhance the effectiveness of other antihypertensive drugs in the more severe forms of hypertension.As a diuretic, cyclothiazide inhibits active chloride reabsorption at the early distal tubule via the Na-Cl cotransporter, resulting in an increase in the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water. Thiazides like cyclothiazide also inhibit sodium ion transport across the renal tubular epithelium through binding to the thiazide sensitive sodium-chloride transporter. This results in an increase in potassium excretion via the sodium-potassium exchange mechanism. The antihypertensive mechanism of cyclothiazide is less well understood although it may be mediated through its action on carbonic anhydrases in the smooth muscle or through its action on the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (KCa) channel, also found in the smooth muscle. Cyclothiazide is indicated as adjunctive therapy in edema associated with congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, and corticosteroid and estrogen therapy. It is also indicated in the management of hypertension either as the sole therapeutic agent or to enhance the effectiveness of other antihypertensive drugs in the more severe forms of hypertension.Like other thiazides, cyclothiazide promotes water loss from the body (diuretics). It inhibits Na+/Cl- reabsorption from the distal convoluted tubules in the kidneys. Thiazides also cause loss of potassium and an increase in serum uric acid. Thiazides are often used to treat hypertension, but their hypotensive effects are not necessarily due to their diuretic activity. Thiazides have been shown to prevent hypertension-related morbidity and mortality although the mechanism is not fully understood. Thiazides cause vasodilation by activating calcium-activated potassium channels (large conductance) in vascular smooth muscles and inhibiting various carbonic anhydrases in vascular tissue. Cyclothiazide affects the distal renal tubular mechanism of electrolyte reabsorption. At maximal therapeutic dosages, all thiazides are approximately equal in their diuretic efficacy. Cyclothiazide increases excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Natriuresis may be accompanied by some loss of potassium and bicarbonate.Hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, inhibits water reabsorption in the nephron by inhibiting the sodium-chloride symporter (SLC12A3) in the distal convoluted tubule, which is responsible for 5% of total sodium reabsorption. Normally, the sodium-chloride symporter transports sodium and chloride from the lumen into the epithelial cell lining the distal convoluted tubule. The energy for this is provided by a sodium gradient established by sodium-potassium ATPases on the basolateral membrane. Once sodium has entered the cell, it is transported out into the basolateral interstitium via the sodium-potassium ATPase, causing an increase in the osmolarity of the interstitium, thereby establishing an osmotic gradient for water reabsorption. By blocking the sodium-chloride symporter, hydrochlorothiazide effectively reduces the osmotic gradient and water reabsorption throughout the nephron.Hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, inhibits water reabsorption in the nephron by inhibiting the sodium-chloride symporter (SLC12A3) in the distal convoluted tubule, which is responsible for 5% of total sodium reabsorption.

367,"Indicated in the treatment of infections caused by penicillinase-producing staphylococci which have demonstrated susceptibility to the drug. A semi-synthetic antibiotic related to penicillin, Naficillin is a narrow-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotic drug. It is a beta-lactamase-resistant penicillin that is indicated for the treatment of Staphylococcal infections caused by strains that are resistant to other penicillins, except those caused by MRSA. It may be used as a first-line therapy in Methicillin-Sensitive *Staphylococcus aureus* infections [A20360].Nafcillin is a semisynthetic antibiotic substance derived from 6-amino-penicillanic acid. The drugs in this class are highly resistant to inactivation by staphylococcal penicillinase and are active against penicillinase-producing and non penicillinase-producing strains of Staphylococcus species. Like other penicillins, nafcillin exerts a bactericidal action against penicillin-susceptible microorganisms during the state of active multiplication in the bacterial cell wall synthesis [FDA Label]. It inhibits the biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall by forming covalent bonds with penicillin-binding proteins that play a critical role in the final transpeptidation process. Binding to penicillin-binding proteins inhibits the transpeptidase and carboxypeptidase activities conferred by these proteins and prevents the formation of the crosslinks [T28]. "

369,"For use in the treatment of pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis when other antitubercular drugs have failed.A second-line antitubercular agent that inhibits mycolic acid synthesis. It also may be used for treatment of leprosy. (From Smith and Reynard, Textbook of Pharmacology, 1992, p868)Ethinamate is bacteriostatic against <i>M. tuberculosis</i>. In a study examining ethionamide resistance, ethionamide administered orally initially decreased the number of culturable <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> organisms from the lungs of H37Rv infected mice. Drug resistance developed with continued ethionamide monotherapy, but did not occur when mice received ethionamide in combination with streptomycin or isoniazid.Ethionamide may be bacteriostatic or bactericidal in action, depending on the concentration of the drug attained at the site of infection and the susceptibility of the infecting organism. Ethionamide, like prothionamide and pyrazinamide, is a nicotinic acid derivative related to isoniazid. It is thought that ethionamide undergoes intracellular modification and acts in a similar fashion to isoniazid. Isoniazid inhibits the synthesis of mycoloic acids, an essential component of the bacterial cell wall. Specifically isoniazid inhibits InhA, the enoyl reductase from <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, by forming a covalent adduct with the NAD cofactor. It is the INH-NAD adduct that acts as a slow, tight-binding competitive inhibitor of InhA."
370,"For the relief of moderate to severe pain.A synthetic morphinan analgesic with narcotic antagonist action. It is used in the management of severe pain.Butorphanol is a synthetic opioid agonist-antagonist analgesic with a pharmacological and therapeutic profile that has been well established since its launch as a parenteral formulation in 1978. The introduction of a transnasal formulation of butorphanol represents a new and noninvasive presentation of an analgesic for moderate to severe pain. This route of administration bypasses the gastrointestinal tract, and this is an advantage for a drug such as butorphanol that undergoes significant first-pass metabolism after oral administration. The onset of action and systemic bioavailability of butorphanol following transnasal delivery are similar to those after parenteral administration. Butorphanol blocks pain impulses at specific sites in the brain and spinal cord.The exact mechanism of action is unknown, but is believed to interact with an opiate receptor site in the CNS (probably in or associated with the limbic system). The opiate antagonistic effect may result from competitive inhibition at the opiate receptor, but may also be a result of other mechanisms. Butorphanol is believed to have both partial agonism and partial antagonism at the μ-opioid receptor, as well as partial agonist and antagonist activity at the κ-opioid receptor."
371,"Bisoprolol is indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension.[L7219] It may be used off-label to treat heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and angina pectoris.[A180460,A180463]Bisoprolol is a cardioselective β1-adrenergic blocking agent used to treat high blood pressure.[A180472,L7219] It is considered a potent drug with a long-half life that can be used once daily to reduce the need for multiple doses of antihypertensive drugs.[A180472] Bisoprolol is generally well tolerated, likely due to its β1-adrenergic receptor selectivity and is a useful alternative to non-selective β-blocker drugs in the treatment of hypertension such as [Carvedilol] and [Labetalol]. It may be used alone or in combination with other drugs to manage hypertension[L7219] and can be useful in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to its receptor selectivity.[A180562]Bisoprolol decreases heart rate (chronotropy), decreases contractility (inotropy), and reduces blood pressure.[T640,L7219] The results of various clinical studies indicate that bisoprolol reduces cardiovascular mortality and all-cause mortality in patients with heart failure and decreased cardiac ejection fraction (EF).[A180466,A180505] Though the mechanism of action of bisoprolol has not been fully elucidated in hypertension, it is thought that therapeutic effects are achieved through the antagonism of β-1adrenoceptors to result in lower cardiac output. Bisoprolol is a competitive, cardioselective β1-adrenergic antagonist. When β1-receptors (located mainly in the heart)[T640] are activated by adrenergic neurotransmitters such as epinephrine, both the blood pressure and heart rate increase, leading to greater cardiovascular work, increasing the demand for oxygen.  Bisoprolol reduces cardiac workload by decreasing contractility and the need for oxygen through competitive inhibition of β1-adrenergic receptors.[A180502,T640]    Bisoprolol is also thought to reduce the output of renin in the kidneys, which normally increases blood pressure. Additionally, some central nervous system effects of bisoprolol may include diminishing sympathetic nervous system output from the brain, decreasing blood pressure and heart rate.[L7219]"
372,"For treatment of acute malarial attacks in non-immune subjects.A 4-aminoquinoquinoline compound with anti-inflammatory properties.Amodiaquine, a 4-aminoquinoline similar to chloroquine in structure and activity, has been used as both an antimalarial and an anti-inflammatory agent for more than 40 years. Amodiaquine is at least as effective as chloroquine, and is effective against some chloroquine-resistant strains, although resistance to amodiaquine has been reported. The mode of action of amodiaquine has not yet been determined. 4-Aminoquinolines depress cardiac muscle, impair cardiac conductivity, and produce vasodilatation with resultant hypotension. They depress respiration and cause diplopia, dizziness and nausea.The mechanism of plasmodicidal action of amodiaquine is not completely certain. Like other quinoline derivatives, it is thought to inhibit heme polymerase activity. This results in accumulation of free heme, which is toxic to the parasites. The drug binds the free heme preventing the parasite from converting it to a form less toxic. This drug-heme complex is toxic and disrupts membrane function."
373,"For the prevention of disseminated <i>Mycobacterium avium</i> complex (MAC) disease in patients with advanced HIV infection.A broad-spectrum antibiotic that is being used as prophylaxis against disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex infection in HIV-positive patients.Rifabutin is an antibiotic that inhibits DNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity in susceptible cells. Specifically, it interacts with bacterial RNA polymerase but does not inhibit the mammalian enzyme. It is bactericidal and has a very broad spectrum of activity against most gram-positive and gram-negative organisms (including <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>) and specifically <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>. Because of rapid emergence of resistant bacteria, use is restricted to treatment of mycobacterial infections and a few other indications. Rifabutin is well absorbed when taken orally and is distributed widely in body tissues and fluids, including the CSF. It is metabolized in the liver and eliminated in bile and, to a much lesser extent, in urine, but dose adjustments are unnecessary with renal insufficiency.Rifabutin acts via the inhibition of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase in gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria, leading to a suppression of RNA synthesis and cell death."
374,"Used for the control of absence (petit mal) seizures that are refractory to treatment with other medications.Paramethadione is an anticonvulsant in the oxazolidinedione class. It is associated with fetal trimethadione syndrome, which is also known as paramethadione syndrome.Paramethadione is an oxazolidinedione anticonvulsant similar to trimethadione that acts on the central nervous system (CNS) to reduce the number of absence seizures (often seen in epileptics). Absence seizures involve an interruption to consciousness where the person experiencing the seizure seems to become vacant and unresponsive for a short period of time (usually up to 30 seconds). Paramethadione acts on thalamic neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus (which studies have shown to be associated with absence seizures, von Krosigk et al., 1993).Dione anticonvulsants such as paramethadione reduce T-type calcium currents in thalamic neurons (including thalamic relay neurons). This inhibits corticothalamic transmission and raises the threshold for repetitive activity in the thalamus. This results in a dampening of the abnormal thalamocortical rhythmicity proposed to underlie the 3-Hz spike-and-wave discharge seen on electroencephalogram (EEG) during absence seizures."
375,"Used primarily to treat Lyme disease, acne, and bronchitis. Also indicated (but rarely used) to treat urinary tract infections, gum disease, malaria, and other bacterial infections such as gonorrhea and chlamydia. One of its other registered uses is the treatment of hyponatremia (low blood sodium concentration) due to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) where fluid restriction alone has been ineffective. A tetracycline analog having a 7-chloro and a 6-methyl. Because it is excreted more slowly than tetracycline, it maintains effective blood levels for longer periods of time.Demeclocycline is a tetracycline antibiotic active against the following microorganisms:Rickettsiae (Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus fever and the typhus group, Q fever, rickettsial pox, tick fevers), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (PPLO, Eaton agent), agents of psittacosis and ornithosis, agents of lymphogranulomavenereum and granuloma inguinale, the spirochetal agent of relapsing fever (Borrelia recurrentis), Haemophilus ducreyi (chancroid), Yersinia pestis, Pasteurella pestis and Pasteurella tularensis, Bartonella bacilliformis, Bacteroides species, Vibrio comma and Vibrio fetus and Brucella species (in conjunction with streptomycin). Demeclocycline inhibits cell growth by inhibiting translation. Demeclocycline is lipophilic and can easily pass through the cell membrane or passively diffuses through porin channels in the bacterial membrane. Demeclocycline is not a direct bactericidal agent; rather, it is a bacteriostatic drug that impairs bacterial growth. Because it is excreted more slowly than tetracycline, it maintains effective blood levels for longer periods of time.Demeclocycline inhibits cell growth by inhibiting translation. It binds (reversibly) to the 30S and 50S ribosomal subunit and prevents the amino-acyl tRNA from binding to the A site of the ribosome, which impairs protein synthesis by bacteria. The binding is reversible in nature. The use in SIADH actually relies on a side-effect of tetracycline antibiotics; many may cause diabetes insipidus (dehydration due to the inability to concentrate urine). It is not completely understood why demeclocycline impairs the action of antidiuretic hormone, but it is thought that it blocks the binding of the hormone to its receptor."
376,"Imatinib is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric chronic myeloid leukemia with Philadelphia chromosome mutation (Ph+) in blast crisis, accelerated phase, or chronic phase after IFN-alpha therapy failure.[L42080] Additionally, imatinib is also indicated to treat adult and pediatric Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia, adult myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases, adult aggressive systemic mastocytosis, adult hypereosinophilic syndrome and/or chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL), adult dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, and malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST).[L42080]  Imatinib is a small molecule kinase inhibitor that revolutionized the treatment of cancer, particularly chronic myeloid leukemia, in 2001.[A249305] It was deemed a ""miracle drug"" due to its clinical success, as oncologist Dr. Brian noted that ""complete hematologic responses were observed in 53 of 54 patients with CML treated with a daily dosage of 300 mg or more and typically occurred in the first four weeks of therapy"".[A249315]. The discovery of imatinib also established a new group of therapy called ""targeted therapy"", since treatment can be tailored specifically to the unique cancer genetics of each patient.[L42220]     Imatinib was approved on February 1st ,2001 by the FDA and November 7th, 2001 by the EMA; however, its European approval has been withdrawn in October 2023.[A263036,L49746,L49751]Imatinib is a 2-phenylaminopyrimidine derivative neoplastic agent that belongs to the class of tyrosine kinase inhibitors.[L42080] Although imatinib inhibits a number of tyrosine kinases, it is quite selective toward the BCR-ABL fusion protein that is present in various cancers.[A249305] BCR-ABL pathway controls many downstream pathways that are heavily implicated in neoplastic growth such as the Ras/MapK pathway (cellular proliferation), Src/Pax/Fak/Rac pathway (cellular motility), and PI/PI3K/AKT/BCL-2 pathway (apoptosis pathway).[A249290, A249295, A249300] Therefore, the BCR-ABL pathway is an attractive target for cancer treatment. Although normal cells also depend on these pathways for growth, these cells tend to have redundant tyrosine kinases to continually function in spite of ABL inhibition from imatinib.[A943] Cancer cells, on the other hand, can have a dependence on BCR-ABL, thus more heavily impacted by imatinib.[A943]   Imatinib mesylate is a protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, the constitutively active tyrosine kinase created by the Philadelphia chromosome abnormality in CML.[L42080]Although the function of normal BCR is still unclear, ABL activation is overexpressed in various tumors and is heavily implicated in cancer cells growth and survival.[A249305,A249310] Imatinib inhibits the BCR-ABL protein by binding to the ATP pocket in the active site, thus preventing downstream phosphorylation of target protein.[A249305]    Imatinib is also an inhibitor of the receptor tyrosine kinases for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and stem cell factor  (SCF), c-Kit, and inhibits PDGF- and SCF-mediated cellular events. In vitro, imatinib inhibits proliferation and induces  apoptosis in GIST cells, which express an activating c-Kit mutation.[L42080]"

381,"For use in combination treatment of HIV infection (AIDS)Efavirenz (brand names Sustiva® and Stocrin®) is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) and is used as part of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for the treatment of a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1.    For HIV infection that has not previously been treated, efavirenz and lamivudine in combination with zidovudine or tenofovir is the preferred NNRTI-based regimen.    Efavirenz is also used in combination with other antiretroviral agents as part of an expanded postexposure prophylaxis regimen to prevent HIV transmission for those exposed to materials associated with a high risk for HIV transmission.Efavirenz (dideoxyinosine, ddI) is an oral non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). It is a synthetic purine derivative and, similar to zidovudine, zalcitabine, and stavudine. Efavirenz was originally approved specifically for the treatment of HIV infections in patients who failed therapy with zidovudine. Currently, the CDC recommends that Efavirenz be given as part of a three-drug regimen that includes another nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (e.g., lamivudine, stavudine, zidovudine) and a protease inhibitor or efavirenz when treating HIV infection.Similar to zidovudine, efavirenz inhibits the activity of viral RNA-directed DNA polymerase (i.e., reverse transcriptase). Antiviral activity of efavirenz is dependent on intracellular conversion to the active triphosphorylated form. The rate of efavirenz phosphorylation varies, depending on cell type. It is believed that inhibition of reverse transcriptase interferes with the generation of DNA copies of viral RNA, which, in turn, are necessary for synthesis of new virions. Intracellular enzymes subsequently eliminate the HIV particle that previously had been uncoated, and left unprotected, during entry into the host cell. Thus, reverse transcriptase inhibitors are virustatic and do not eliminate HIV from the body. Even though human DNA polymerase is less susceptible to the pharmacologic effects of triphosphorylated efavirenz, this action may nevertheless account for some of the drug's toxicity."

384,"Clorazepate is indicated for the management of anxiety disorders or the short-term relief of the symptoms of anxiety. It is also used as adjunctive therapy in the management of partial seizures and for the symptomatic relief of acute alcohol withdrawal.[L44788]Clorazepic acid (clorazepate) is a water-soluble benzodiazepine with muscle-relaxant and anticonvulsant actions effective in the treatment of anxiety.[A957,L44788] Following administration, clorazepate is rapidly converted to nordiazepam (N-desmethyldiazepam), its active metabolite, before entering systemic circulation. Similar to other benzodiazepines, the active metabolite of clorazepate enhances the binding of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to the GABA type A (GABA-A) receptor, which promotes channel opening and neuronal hyperpolarization.[A256683,T883] The concomitant use of clorazepate and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Also, the use of clorazepate exposes users to users to the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, and its continued use may lead to significant physical dependence. In September 2020, a black box warning describing these risks was included on the product label of benzodiazepines as per FDA regulation.[L44798] Clorazepate and its active metabolite, nordiazepam, are present in breast milk.[A958,L44788]Pharmacologically, clorazepate has the characteristics of benzodiazepines. Studies in healthy men have shown that clorazepate has depressant effects on the central nervous system. Since orally administered clorazepate dipotassium is rapidly decarboxylated to form nordiazepam, there is essentially no circulating parent drug.[L44788] The use of benzodiazepines, including clorazepate, exposes users to abuse, misuse, and addiction risks, which can lead to overdose and death. Patients treated with clorazepate may also develop suicidal behavior and ideation, and the use of clorazepate may cause interference with psychomotor performance. The concomitant use of clorazepate with opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death.[L44788]Clorazepate is a benzodiazepine with depressant effects on the central nervous system.[L44788] Benzodiazepines are able to enhance the binding of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to the GABA type A (GABA-A) receptor by binding to a region in the extracellular domain found at the interface between the alpha (α) and gamma (γ) subunits of the GABA-A receptor. The interaction of GABA and the GABA-A receptor promotes channel opening, leading to an increased chloride influx. Consequently, the use of benzodiazepines, such as clorazepate, leads to neuronal hyperpolarization.[A256683,T883]"
385,"Administered intravenously, dexmedetomidine is indicated for the sedation of initially intubated and mechanically ventilated patients during treatment in intensive care settings, and for the sedation of non-intubated patients prior to and/or during surgery and other procedures.[L41374] It is also available as a buccally- or sublingually-administered dissolvable film for the acute treatment of agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar I or II disorder.[L41379]An agonist of receptors, adrenergic alpha-2 that is used in veterinary medicine for its analgesic and sedative properties.

386,"For the treatment of bacterial vaginitis, keratitis, acute conjunctivitis, and blepharitis.An anti-infective agent that is used topically to treat skin infections and orally for urinary tract infections.Sulfacetamide is a sulfonamide antibiotic with bacteriostatic actions and broad-spectrum activity against most gram-positive and many gram-negative organisms. However, many strains of an individual species may be resistant. Sulfonamides inhibit multiplication of bacteria by acting as competitive inhibitors of p-aminobenzoic acid in the folic acid metabolism cycle. Bacterial sensitivity is the same for the various sulfonamides, and resistance to one sulfonamide indicates resistance to all. Most sulfonamides are readily absorbed orally. However, parenteral administration is difficult, since the soluble sulfonamide salts are highly alkaline and irritating to the tissues. The sulfonamides are widely distributed throughout all tissues. High levels are achieved in pleural, peritoneal, synovial, and ocular fluids. Although these drugs are no longer used to treat meningitis, CSF levels are high in meningeal infections. Their antibacterial action is inhibited by pus.Sulfacetamide is a competitive inhibitor of bacterial para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), an essential component for bacterial growth (according to the Woods-Fildes theory). The inhibited reaction is necessary in these organisms for the synthesis of folic acid."

388,"For Primary Dysbetalipoproteinemia (Type III hyperlipidemia) that does not respond adequately to diet. This helps control high cholesterol and high triglyceride levels. A fibric acid derivative used in the treatment of hyperlipoproteinemia type III and severe hypertriglyceridemia. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p986)Clofibrate is an antilipidemic agent similar to gemfibrozil. It acts to lower elevated serum lipids by reducing the very low-density lipoprotein fraction (S<sub>f</sub> 20-400) rich in triglycerides. Serum cholesterol may be decreased, particularly in those patients whose cholesterol elevation is due to the presence of IDL as a result of Type III hyperlipoproteinemia. Several investigators have observed in their studies that clofibrate may produce a decrease in cholesterol linoleate but an increase in palmitoleate and oleate, the latter being considered atherogenic in experimental animals. The significance of this finding is unknown at this time. Reduction of triglycerides in some patients treated with clofibrate or certain of its chemically and clinically similar analogs may be associated with an increase in LDL cholesterol. Increase in LDL cholesterol has been observed in patients whose cholesterol is initially normal. Animal studies suggest that clofibrate interrupts cholesterol biosynthesis prior to mevalonate formation.Clofibrate increases the activity of extrahepatic lipoprotein lipase (LL), thereby increasing lipoprotein triglyceride lipolysis. Chylomicrons are degraded, VLDLs are converted to LDLs, and LDLs are converted to HDL. This is accompanied by a slight increase in secretion of lipids into the bile and ultimately the intestine. Clofibrate also inhibits the synthesis and increases the clearance of apolipoprotein B, a carrier molecule for VLDL. Also, as a fibrate, Clofibrate is an agonist of the PPAR-α receptor[4] in muscle, liver, and other tissues. This agonism ultimately leads to modification in gene expression resulting in increased beta-oxidation, decreased triglyceride secretion, increased HDL, increased lipoprotein lipase activity."
389,"Astemizole was indicated for use in the relieving allergy symptoms, particularly rhinitis and conjunctivitis. It has been withdrawn from the market however due to concerns of arrhythmias.Astemizole is a long-acting, non-sedating second generation antihistamine used in the treatment of allergy symptoms. It was withdrawn from market by the manufacturer in 1999 due to the potential to cause arrhythmias at high doses, especially when  when taken with CYP inhibitors or grapefruit juice.Astemizole is a second generation H1-receptor antagonist. It does not significantly cross the blood brain barrier and therefore does not cause drowsiness or CNS depression at normal doses.Astemizole competes with histamine for binding at H1-receptor sites in the GI tract, uterus, large blood vessels, and bronchial muscle. This reversible binding of astemizole to H1-receptors suppresses the formation of edema, flare, and pruritus resulting from histaminic activity. As the drug does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier and preferentially binds at H1 receptors in the peripehery rather than within the brain, CNS depression is minimal. Astemizole may also act on H3-receptors, producing adverse effects."
390,"For the local treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (infections caused by Candida)Butoconazole is an imidazole antifungal used in gynecology.Butoconazole is an imidazole derivative that has fungicidal activity in vitro against Candida spp. and has been demonstrated to be clinically effective against vaginal infections due to Candida albicans. Candida albicans has been identified as the predominant species responsible for vulvovaginal candidasis.The exact mechanism of the antifungal action of butoconazole is unknown, however, it is presumed to function as other imidazole derivatives via inhibition of steroid synthesis. Imidazoles generally inhibit the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol via the inhibition of the enzyme cytochrome P450 14&alpha;-demethylase, resulting in a change in fungal cell membrane lipid composition. This structural change alters cell permeability and, ultimately, results in the osmotic disruption or growth inhibition of the fungal cell."
391,"Adenosine is indicated as an adjunct to thallium-201 in myocardial perfusion scintigraphy in patients unable to adequately exercise.[L31983] It is also indicated to convert sinus rhythm of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.[L31998]The structure of adenosine was first described in 1931,[A229823] though the vasodilating effects were not described in literature until the 1940s.[A229828] Adenosine is indicated as an adjunct to thallium-201 in myocardial perfusion scintigraphy,[L31983] though it is rarely used in this indication, having largely been replaced by [dipyridamole] and [regadenson].[A229833,A229838] Adenosine is also indicated in the treatment of supraventricular tachycardia.[L31998]    Adenosine was granted FDA approval on 30 October 1989.[L31978]Adenosine is indicated as an adjunct to thallium-201 in myocardial perfusion scintigraphy and also indicated for conversion of sinus rhythm of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.[L31983,L31998] Adenosine has a short duration of action as the half life is <10 seconds, and a wide therapeutic window.[L31983,L31998] Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of cardiovascular side effects, bronchoconstriction, seizures, and hypersensitivity.[L31983,L31998]Agonism of adenosine receptors A1 and A2 reduces conduction time in the atrioventricular node of the heart.[A187466,A229818,L31983] Conduction time is decreased by inducing potassium efflux and inhibiting calcium influx through channels in nerve cells, leading to hyperpolarization and and increased threshold for calcium dependent action potentials.[A187466] Decreased conduction time leads to an antiarrhythmic effect.[A187466] Inhibition of calcium influx, reduces the activity of adenylate cyclase, relaxing vascular smooth muscle.[A229818] Relaxed vascular smooth muscle leads to increased blood flow through normal coronary arteries but not stenotic arteries, allowing thallium-201 to be more readily uptaken in normal coronary arteries.[L31983]"
392,"Simvastatin is indicated for the treatment of hyperlipidemia to reduce elevated total cholesterol (total-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‑C), apolipoprotein B (Apo B), and triglycerides (TG), and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C).[F4655, F4658]    This includes the treatment of primary hyperlipidemia (Fredrickson type IIa, heterozygous familial and nonfamilial), mixed dyslipidemia (Fredrickson type IIb), hypertriglyceridemia (Fredrickson type IV hyperlipidemia), primary dysbetalipoproteinemia (Fredrickson type III hyperlipidemia), homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments, as well as adolescent patients with Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HeFH).[F4655, F4658]    Simvastatin is also indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality including myocardial infarction, stroke, and the need for revascularization procedures. It is primarily used in patients at high risk of coronary events because of existing coronary heart disease, diabetes, peripheral vessel disease, history of stroke or other cerebrovascular disease.[F4655, F4658]    Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD. Statin-indicated conditions include diabetes mellitus, clinical atherosclerosis (including myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stable angina, documented coronary artery disease, stroke, trans ischemic attack (TIA), documented carotid disease, peripheral artery disease, and claudication), abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and severely elevated LDL-C levels.[A181087, A181406]Simvastatin, also known as the brand name product Zocor, is a lipid-lowering drug derived synthetically from a fermentation product of _Aspergillus terreus_. It belongs to the statin class of medications, which are used to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and manage abnormal lipid levels by inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as ""bad cholesterol""), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]    Simvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] Increasing use of the statin class of drugs is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]    While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, [rosuvastatin] is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg [rosuvastatin] per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decrease in LDL cholesterol levels, while simvastatin has been found to have an average decrease in LDL-C of ~35%.[A181409,A181535,A181538,A1793] Potency is thought to correlate to tissue permeability as the more lipophilic statins such as simvastatin are thought to enter endothelial cells by passive diffusion, as opposed to hydrophilic statins such as [pravastatin] and [rosuvastatin] which are taken up into hepatocytes through OATP1B1 (organic anion transporter protein 1B1)-mediated transport.[A181424,A181460] Despite these differences in potency, several trials have demonstrated only minimal differences in terms of clinical outcomes between statins.[A181427]Simvastatin is an oral antilipemic agent which inhibits HMG-CoA reductase. It is used to lower total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apoB), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and trigleride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease and high ratios are associated with higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, rosuvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[A181087, A181406]    Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]    **Skeletal Muscle Effects**    Simvastatin occasionally causes myopathy manifested as muscle pain, tenderness or weakness with creatine kinase (CK) above ten times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Myopathy sometimes takes the form of rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria, and rare fatalities have occurred. Predisposing factors for myopathy include advanced age (�?5 years), female gender, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and renal impairment. Chinese patients may also be at increased risk for myopathy. In most cases, muscle symptoms and CK increases resolved when treatment was promptly discontinued.[F4655, F4658]    In a clinical trial database of 41,413 patients, the incidence of myopathy was approximately 0.03% and 0.08% at 20 and 40 mg/day, respectively, while the risk of myopathy with simvastatin 80 mg (0.61%) was disproportionately higher than that observed at the lower doses. It's therefore recommended that the 80mg dose of simvastatin should be used only in patients who have been taking simvastatin 80 mg chronically (e.g., for 12 months or more) without evidence of muscle toxicity. As well, patients already stabilized on simvastatin 80mg should be monitored closely for evidence of muscle toxicity; if they need to be initiated on an interacting drug that is contraindicated or is associated with a dose cap for simvastatin, that patient should be switched to an alternative statin with less potential for the drug-drug interaction.[F4655, F4658]    The risk of myopathy during treatment with simvastatin may be increased with concurrent administration of interacting drugs such as [fenofibrate], [niacin], [gemfibrozil], [cyclosporine], and strong inhibitors of the CYP3A4 enzyme.  Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors coadministered with [colchicine], and caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing these two medications together.[F4655, F4658]    **Liver Enzyme Abnormalities**    Persistent increases (to more than 3X the ULN) in serum transaminases have occurred in approximately 1% of patients who received simvastatin in clinical studies. When drug treatment was interrupted or discontinued in these patients, the transaminase levels usually fell slowly to pretreatment levels. The increases were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms. [F4655, F4658]    In the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S),[A181538] the number of patients with more than one transaminase elevation to >3 times the ULN, over the course of the study, was not significantly different between the simvastatin and placebo groups (14 [0.7%] vs. 12 [0.6%]). The frequency of single elevations of ALT to 3 times the ULN was significantly higher in the simvastatin group in the first year of the study (20 vs. 8, p=0.023), but not thereafter. In the HPS (Heart Protection Study),[A181475] in which 20,536 patients were randomized to receive simvastatin 40 mg/day or placebo, the incidences of elevated transaminases (>3X ULN confirmed by repeat test) were 0.21% (n=21) for patients treated with simvastatin and 0.09% (n=9) for patients treated with placebo.[F4655, F4658]     **Endocrine Effects**    Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including simvastatin.[F4655]    Although cholesterol is the precursor of all steroid hormones, studies with simvastatin have suggested that this agent has no clinical effect on steroidogenesis. Simvastatin caused no increase in biliary lithogenicity and, therefore, would not be expected to increase the incidence of gallstones.[F4658]Simvastatin is a prodrug in which the 6-membered lactone ring of simvastatin is hydrolyzed <i>in vivo</i> to generate the beta,delta-dihydroxy acid, an active metabolite structurally similar to HMG-CoA (hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA). Once hydrolyzed, simvastatin competes with HMG-CoA for HMG-CoA reductase, a hepatic microsomal enzyme, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.[A181421] Simvastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors which increases hepatic uptake of LDL. Simvastatin also inhibits hepatic synthesis of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL).[F4655, F4658] The overall effect is a decrease in plasma LDL and VLDL.     At therapeutic doses, the HMG-CoA enzyme is not completely blocked by simvastatin activity, thereby allowing biologically necessary amounts of mevalonate to remain available. As mevalonate is an early step in the biosynthetic pathway for cholesterol, therapy with simvastatin would also not be expected to cause any accumulation of potentially toxic sterols. In addition, HMG-CoA is metabolized readily back to acetyl-CoA, which participates in many biosynthetic processes in the body.[F4658]    In vitro and in vivo animal studies also demonstrate that simvastatin exerts vasculoprotective effects independent of its lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.[A181424] This includes improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response.    Statins have also been found to bind allosterically to β2 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an important role in leukocyte trafficking and in T cell activation.[A181559]"
393,"[L40943,L44883] In the US, it is reserved for patients whose disease is unresectable or otherwise not candidates for curative surgery.[L40943]Pemetrexed is a chemotherapy drug that is manufactured and marketed by Eli Lilly and Company under the brand name Alimta. Its use in non-small cell lung cancer has also been investigated. Based on population pharmacodynamic analyses, the depth of the absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) nadir correlates with systemic exposure to pemetrexed and supplementation with folic acid and vitamin B12. There is no cumulative effect of pemetrexed exposure on ANC nadir over multiple treatment cycles.[L40943] Pemetrexed is an antifolate containing the pyrrolopyrimidine-based nucleus that exerts its antineoplastic activity by disrupting folate-dependent metabolic processes essential for cell replication. In vitro studies have shown that pemetrexed inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT), all folate-dependent enzymes involved in the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides. Pemetrexed is transported into cells by both the reduced folate carrier and membrane folate binding protein transport systems. Once in the cell, pemetrexed is converted to polyglutamate forms by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase. The polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are inhibitors of TS and GARFT. Polyglutamation is a time- and concentration-dependent process that occurs in tumor cells and, to a lesser extent, in normal tissues. Polyglutamated metabolites have an increased intracellular half-life resulting in prolonged drug action in malignant cells.[A973,A974,A975,A976,A253907,L40943]"
394,"For the treatment of <i>Enterobius vermicularis</i> (pinworm), <i>Trichuris trichiura</i> (whipworm), <i>Ascaris lumbricoides</i> (common roundworm), <i>Ancylostoma duodenale</i> (common hookworm), <i>Necator americanus</i> (American hookworm) in single or mixed infections.A benzimidazole that acts by interfering with carbohydrate metabolism and inhibiting polymerization of microtubules. [PubChem]Mebendazole is a (synthetic) broad-spectrum anthelmintic. The principal mode of action for Mebendazole is by its inhibitory effect on tubulin polymerization which results in the loss of cytoplasmic microtubules.Mebendazole causes degenerative alterations in the tegument and intestinal cells of the worm by binding to the colchicine-sensitive site of tubulin, thus inhibiting its polymerization or assembly into microtubules. The loss of the cytoplasmic microtubules leads to impaired uptake of glucose by the larval and adult stages of the susceptible parasites, and depletes their glycogen stores. Degenerative changes in the endoplasmic reticulum, the mitochondria of the germinal layer, and the subsequent release of lysosomes result in decreased production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the energy required for the survival of the helminth. Due to diminished energy production, the parasite is immobilized and eventually dies."
395,"For the relief of mild to moderate pain.Dextropropoxyphene is an opioid analgesic manufactured by Eli Lilly and Company. It is used in the symptomatic treatment of mild pain. It displays antitussive and local anaesthetic actions. Due to the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and overdose, possibly leading to death, dextropropoxyphene has been withdrawn from the market in Europe and the United States. The drug is often referred to as the general form, ""propoxyphene"", however only the dextro-isomer (dextropropoxyphene) has any analgesic effect. The levo-isomer appears to exhibit a very limited antitussive effect.Propoxyphene, a synthetic opiate agonist, is structurally similar to methadone. Its general pharmacologic properties are those of the opiates as a group. The analgesic effect of propoxyphene is due to the d-isomer, dextropropoxyphene. It binds to the opiate receptors and leads to a decrease of the perception of pain stimuli. Propoxyphene possesses little to no antitussive activity and no antipyretic action.Propoxyphene acts as a weak agonist at OP1, OP2, and OP3 opiate receptors within the central nervous system (CNS). Propoxyphene primarily affects OP3 receptors, which are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as modulators, both positive and negative, of synaptic transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine, and noradrenaline is inhibited. Opioids such as propoxyphene also inhibit the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin, and glucagon. Opioids close N-type voltage-operated calcium channels (OP2-receptor agonist) and open calcium-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channels (OP3 and OP1 receptor agonist). This results in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability."
396,"Mitotane is indicated for the treatment of inoperable, functional or nonfunctional, adrenocortical carcinoma.[L49570]Mitotane is an adrenolytic isomer of the insecticide dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD) - itself a metabolite of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) - that inhibits cells of the adrenal cortex and their production of hormones.

Stavudine is phosphorylated to active metabolites that compete for incorporation into viral DNA. They inhibit the HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme competitively and act as a chain terminator of DNA synthesis. The lack of a 3'-OH group in the incorporated nucleoside analogue prevents the formation of the 5' to 3' phosphodiester linkage essential for DNA chain elongation, and therefore, the viral DNA growth is terminated.Stavudine inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) both by competing with the natural substrate dGTP and by its incorporation into viral DNA."
398,"For relief of acute bronchial asthma and for reversible bronchospasm associated with chronic bronchitis and emphysema.Dyphylline is a theophylline derivative with broncho- and vasodilator properties. It is typically used in the management of asthma, cardiac dyspnea, and bronchitis.Dyphylline, a xanthine derivative, is a bronchodilator used for relief of acute bronchial asthma and for reversible bronchospasm associated with chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Dyphylline is a xanthine derivative with pharmacologic actions similar to theophylline and other members of this class of drugs. Its primary action is that of bronchodilation, but it also exhibits peripheral vasodilatory and other smooth muscle relaxant activity to a lesser degree.The bronchodilatory action of dyphylline, as with other xanthines, is thought to be mediated through competitive inhibition of phosphodiesterase with a resulting increase in cyclic AMP producing relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle as well as antagonism of adenosine receptors."
399,"For the relief of moderate to severe pain.The first mixed agonist-antagonist analgesic to be marketed. It is an agonist at the kappa and sigma opioid receptors and has a weak antagonist action at the mu receptor. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1991, p97)Pentazocine is a potent analgesic which when administered orally in a 50 mg dose appears equivalent in analgesic effect to 60 mg (1 grain) of codeine. Onset of significant analgesia usually occurs between 15 and 30 minutes after oral administration, and duration of action is usually three hours or longer. Onset and duration of action and the degree of pain relief are related both to dose and the severity of pretreatment pain. Pentazocine weakly antagonizes the analgesic effects of morphine and meperidine; in addition, it produces incomplete reversal of cardiovascular, respiratory, and behavioral depression induced by morphine and meperidine. Pentazocine has about 1/50 the antagonistic activity of nalorphine. It also has sedative activity.The preponderance of evidence suggests that pentazocine antagonizes the opioid effects by competing for the same receptor sites, especially the opioid mu receptor."

Also used in uterine tetany as a myometriat relaxant.A small colorless crystal used as an anticonvulsant, a cathartic, and an electrolyte replenisher in the treatment of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. It causes direct inhibition of action potentials in myometrial muscle cells. Excitation and contraction are uncoupled, which decreases the frequency and force of contractions. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1992, p1083)Magnesium sulfate is a small colorless crystal used as an anticonvulsant, a cathartic, and an electrolyte replenisher in the treatment of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. It causes direct inhibition of action potentials in myometrial muscle cells. Excitation and contraction are uncoupled, which decreases the frequency and force of contractions. Magnesium sulfate is gaining popularity as an initial treatment in the management of various dysrhythmias, particularly torsades de pointes, and dyrhythmias secondary to TCA overdose or digitalis toxicity.Magnesium is the second most plentiful cation of the intracellular fluids. It is essential for the activity of many enzyme systems and plays an important role with regard to neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. Magnesium sulfate reduces striated muscle contractions and blocks peripheral neuromuscular transmission by reducing acetylcholine release at the myoneural junction. Additionally, Magnesium inhibits Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through dihydropyridine-sensitive, voltage-dependent channels. This accounts for much of its relaxant action on vascular smooth muscle."
401,"Latanoprost is indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure in patients who have been diagnosed with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.[L8357,L8402,L44401] It is available as monotherapy or in a combination product with [netarsudil] [L8369] or [timolol].[L15217]    In Canada, latanoprost is also indicated to treat elevated intraocular pressure due to angle-closure glaucoma that has been treated with peripheral iridotomy or laser iridoplasty.[L8402]Latanoprost is a prodrug analog of prostaglandin F2 alpha that is used to treat elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). It was initially approved by the FDA in 1998. Latanoprost is the first topical prostaglandin F2 alpha analog used for glaucoma treatment.[A184493] It has been found to be well-tolerated and its use does not normally result in systemic adverse effects like other drugs used to treat elevated intraocular pressure, such as [Timolol]. Another benefit latanoprost is that it can be administered once a day.[A184490]Latanoprost effectively decreases intraocular pressure by increasing uveoscleral outflow.[A184490] A decrease in intraocular pressure has been measured within 3�? hours post-administration, reaches a maximum decrease at 8�?2 hours, and can be maintained for a period of 24 hours.[A184493]     **A note on eye and periorbital changes**     Between 3 to 10% of patients taking latanoprost have experienced iris pigmentation after about 3-4 months of latanoprost use.[A982,A184490] Patients should be notified of this risk before initiating treatment.  It may occur in both patients with light-colored irides (green-brown or blue/grey-brown) or dark-colored (brown) irides, but is less pronounced in the latter group.[A982] This drug may also cause other ocular effects including infrequent conjunctival hyperemia, pigmentation of periocular tissues, eyelash changes, hypertrichosis, and ocular irritation.[A184493,L8357] Elevated intraocular pressure leads to an increased risk of glaucomatous visual field loss. The higher the intraocular pressure, the higher the risk of damage to the optic nerve and loss of visual field.[L8357] Latanoprost selectively stimulates the prostaglandin F2 alpha receptor and this results in a decreased intraocular pressure (IOP) via the increased outflow of aqueous humor, which is often implicated in cases of elevated intraocular pressure.[A184490,L8357] Possible specific mechanisms of the abovementioned increased aqueous outflow are the remodeling of the extracellular matrix and regulation of matrix metalloproteinases. These actions result in higher tissue permeability related to humor outflow pathways, which likely change outflow resistance and/or outflow rates.[A184493]   "
402,"For management of perimenopausal and postmenopausal symptoms.Estrone, one of the major mammalian estrogens, is an aromatized C18 steroid with a 3-hydroxyl group and a 17-ketone. It is produced in vivo from androstenedione or from testosterone via estradiol. It is produced primarily in the ovaries, placenta, and in peripheral tissues (especially adipose tissue) through conversion of adrostenedione. Estrone may be further metabolized to 16-alpha-hydroxyestrone, which may be reduced to estriol by estradiol dehydrogenase.Estrone, a synthetically prepared or naturally occurring steroidal estrogen obtained from pregnant equine urine, is the primary circulating estrogen after menopause. Estrone is naturally derived from the peripheral conversion of androstenedione by an aromatase enzyme found in adipose tissues and is converted to estradiol in peripheral tissues. The estrogenic potency of estrone is one third that of estradiol. Estropipate is piperazine-stabilized estrone sulfate. Estrone, and estropipate are used to treat abnormalities related to gonadotropin hormone dysfunction, vasomotor symptoms, atrophic vaginitis, and vulvar atrophy associated with menopause, and for the prevention of osteoporosis due to estrogen deficiency.Estrogens enter the cells of responsive tissues (e.g. female organs, breasts, hypothalamus, pituitary) where they interact with estrogen receptors. Hormone-bound estrogen receptors dimerize, translocate to the nucleus of cells and bind to estrogen response elements (ERE) of genes. Binding to ERE alters the transcription rate of affected genes. Estrogens increase the hepatic synthesis of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), thyroid-binding globulin (TBG), and other serum proteins and suppress follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) release from the anterior pituitary."
403,"Trazodone is indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD).[L3484] It has been used off-label for adjunct therapy in alcohol dependence, and off-label to treat anxiety and insomnia.[L3484] It may also be used off-label to treat symptoms of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, eating disorders, and fibromyalgia due to its effects on various neurotransmitter receptors.[A31634]Trazodone is triazolopyridine derivative from the serotonin receptor antagonists and reuptake inhibitors (SARIs) class of antidepressants.[A181180] It is used in adults and has been shown to be comparable in efficacy to other drugs such as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin-norepinephrine receptor inhibitor (SNRIs) in the treatment of depression.[T646] A unique feature of this drug is that it does not promote the anxiety symptoms, sexual symptoms, or insomnia, which are commonly associated with SSRI and SNRI therapy.[T646] Trazodone acts on various receptors, including certain histamine, serotonin, and adrenergic receptors, distinguishing it from other antidepressants that cover a narrow range of neurotransmitters.[T646] It was initially granted FDA approval in 1981.[L3484]Trazodone treats depressed mood and other depression-related symptoms and shows benefit in the treatment of insomnia due to its sedating effects.[T646] It is known to prolong the cardiac QT-interval.[L3484] Memory, alertness, and cognition may be decreased by trazodone, especially in elderly patients due to its central nervous system depressant effects.[A181177]    A note on priapism    Trazodone has been associated with the occurrence of priapism, a painful and persistent incidence of penile tissue erection that is unrelievable and can cause permanent neurological damage if left untreated. Patients must be advised to seek immediate medical attention if priapism is suspected.[A181198,L3484]The mechanism of action of trazodone is not fully understood, however, it is known to inhibit the reuptake of serotonin and block both histamine and alpha-1-adrenergic receptors.[T646]  Despite the fact that trazodone is frequently considered a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, several reports have shown that other mechanisms including antagonism at serotonin 5-HT1a, 5-HT1c, and 5-HT2 receptor subtypes may occur.[A181177,T646] The strongest antagonism of trazodone is reported to occur at the serotonin   5-HT21c receptors, preventing serotonin uptake.[A985] In addition to acting on serotonin receptors, trazodone has been shown to inhibit serotonin transporters.[A4334,A181457]  The antidepressant effects of trazodone result from the inhibition of receptor uptake, which normally decreases circulating neurotransmitters, contributing to depressive symptoms.[A181186,A175840] "
404,"For the control of serum phosphorus in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) on hemodialysis.Sevelamer is a phosphate binding drug used to prevent hyperphosphataemia in patients with chronic renal failure. It is marketed by Genzyme under the trade name Renagel.Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) retain phosphorus and can develop hyperphosphatemia. High serum phosphorus can precipitate serum calcium resulting in ectopic calcification. When the product of serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations (Ca x P) exceeds 55 mg2/dL2, there is an increased risk that ectopic calcification will occur. Hyperphosphatemia plays a role in the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism in renal insufficiency. An increase in parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels is characteristic of patients with chronic renal failure. Increased levels of PTH can lead to osteitis fibrosa, a bone disease. A decrease in serum phosphorus may decrease serum PTH levels. Treatment of hyperphosphatemia includes reduction in dietary intake of phosphate, inhibition of intestinal phosphate absorption with phosphate binders, and removal of phosphate with dialysis. Sevelamer taken with meals has been shown to decrease serum phosphorus concentrations in patients with ESRD who are on hemodialysis. In vitro studies have shown that the capsule and tablet formulations bind phosphate to a similar extent. Sevelamer treatment also results in a lowering of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and total serum cholesterol levels.Seprevents hyperphosphatemia by binding to dietary phosphate in the gut, preventing its absorption and thus decreasing serum parathyroid hormone levels."
405,"Acamprosate is indicated for the maintenance of abstinence from alcohol in patients with alcohol dependence who are abstinent at treatment initiation. It is also indicated for the maintenance of alcohol abstinence in patients who have undergone alcohol detoxification. This drug should be used with a psychosocial support program providing adequate support.[L31738]Alcohol use disorder is responsible for a large worldwide burden of morbidity, premature mortality, and economic consequences resulting from accidents, violence, incarceration, decreased productivity, and increased healthcare spending.[A229073]    Acamprosate, also known by the brand name Campral, is a drug used for the maintenance of alcohol abstinence. It is a structural analogue of the neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA).[L31758] Acamprosate is the first medication specifically formulated for the maintenance of alcohol abstinence in ethanol-dependent patients after alcohol detoxification[A997], unlike [naltrexone] and [disulfiram]. It was first approved by the FDA in 2004 and initially marketed by Forest Laboratories.[L31783]Acamprosate acts on the CNS, aiding in the restoration of normal glutaminergic neuron activity.[A993] Pharmacodynamic studies have shown that acamprosate calcium reduces alcohol intake in alcohol-dependent individuals, likely through effects on NMDA receptors and calcium channels.[A229038]   It is a safe and well-tolerated drug for patients with alcohol dependency and improves the likelihood of alcohol abstinence.[A993,L31758]     The mechanism of action of acamprosate for the maintenance of alcohol abstinence has not been established. Chronic alcohol exposure is believed to modify the balance between neuronal excitation and inhibition. Results of studies in animals suggest acamprosate may interact with glutamate and GABA neurotransmitter systems in the CNS, supporting the hypothesis that acamprosate restores the balance between neuronal excitation and inhibition.[A996,L31738] Evidence shows that acamprosate directly binds and inhibits GABA B receptors and indirectly affects GABA A receptors.[A229023,A229118]"
406,"Verapamil is indicated in the treatment of vasopastic (i.e. Prinzmetal's) angina, unstable angina, and chronic stable angina. It is also indicated to treat hypertension, for the prophylaxis of repetitive paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, and in combination with digoxin to control ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.[L8791] Given intravenously, it is indicated for the treatment of various supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, including rapid conversion to sinus rhythm in patients with supraventricular tachycardia and for temporary control of ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.[L10481]    Verapamil is commonly used off-label for prophylaxis of cluster headaches.[A13983]Verapamil is a phenylalkylamine calcium channel blocker used in the treatment of high blood pressure, heart arrhythmias, and angina,[L8791] and was the first calcium channel antagonist to be introduced into therapy in the early 1960s.[A188514] It is a member of the non-dihydropyridine class of calcium channel blockers, which includes drugs like [diltiazem] and [flunarizine], but is chemically unrelated to other cardioactive medications.[L8791] Verapamil is administered as a racemic mixture containing equal amounts of the S- and R-enantiomer, each of which is pharmacologically distinct - the S-enantiomer carries approximately 20-fold greater potency than the R-enantiomer, but is metabolized at a higher rate.[A188435]Verapamil is an L-type calcium channel blocker with antiarrhythmic, antianginal, and antihypertensive activity.[L8791] Immediate-release verapamil has a relatively short duration of action, requiring dosing 3 to 4 times daily,[L8791] but extended-release formulations are available that allow for once-daily dosing.[L10478,L10637] As verapamil is a negative inotropic medication (i.e. it decreases the strength of myocardial contraction), it should not be used in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as the decrease in contractility caused by verapamil may increase the risk of exacerbating these pre-existing conditions.[L10478]Verapamil inhibits L-type calcium channels by binding to a specific area of their alpha-1 subunit,[L10478]Cav1.2, which is highly expressed on L-type calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle and myocardial tissue where these channels are responsible for the control of peripheral vascular resistance and heart contractility.[A175396] Calcium influx through these channels allows for the propagation of action potentials necessary for the contraction of muscle tissue and the heart's electrical pacemaker activity. Verapamil binds to these channels in a voltage- and frequency-dependent manner, meaning affinity is increased 1) as vascular smooth muscle membrane potential is reduced, and 2) with excessive depolarizing stimulus.[L10478]     Verapamil's mechanism of action in the treatment of angina and hypertension is likely due to the mechanism described above. Inhibition of calcium influx prevents the contraction of vascular smooth muscle, causing relaxation/dilation of blood vessels throughout the peripheral circulation - this lowers systemic vascular resistance (i.e. afterload) and thus blood pressure. This reduction in vascular resistance also reduces the force against which the heart must push, decreasing myocardial energy consumption and oxygen requirements and thus alleviating angina.[L8791]    Electrical activity through the AV node is responsible for determining heart rate, and this activity is dependent upon calcium influx through L-type calcium channels. By inhibiting these channels and decreasing the influx of calcium, verapamil prolongs the refractory period of the AV node and slows conduction, thereby slowing and controlling the heart rate in patients with arrhythmia.[L8791]    Verapamil's mechanism of action in the treatment of cluster headaches is unclear, but is thought to result from an effect on other calcium channels (e.g. N-, P-, Q-, or T-type).[A13983]    Verapamil is known to interact with other targets, including other calcium channels,[A188490,A13984,A188502,A15331] potassium channels,[A188496,A13985,A13983] and adrenergic receptors.[A20291,A31755]"

In dogs pretreated with trimethobenzamide HCl, the emetic response to apomorphine is inhibited, while little or no protection is afforded against emesis induced by intragastric copper sulfate.The mechanism of action of trimethobenzamide as determined in animals is obscure, but may involve the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), an area in the medulla oblongata through which emetic impulses are conveyed to the vomiting center; direct impulses to the vomiting center apparently are not similarly inhibited."
408,"For the treatment of contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, exczema, psoriasis, diaper rash and other skin conditionsFlumethasone is a moderately potent difluorinated corticosteroid ester with anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive properties. As it is a privalate salt, its anti-inflammatory action is concentrated at the site of application. This local effect on diseased areas results in a prompt decrease in inflammation, exudation and itching.Flumethasone pivalate is a moderately potent difluorinated corticosteroid ester with anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive properties. As it is a privalate salt, its anti-inflammatory action is concentrated at the site of application. This local effect on diseased areas results in a prompt decrease in inflammation, exudation and itching.Flumethasone is a glucocorticoid receptor agonist. This complex binds to the nucleus causing a variety of genetic activation and repressions. The antiinflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. The immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference with antigen-antibody binding. Flumethasone binds to plasma transcortin, and it becomes active when it is not bound to transcortin."
409,"For the treatment of urinary tract infection and chronic bronchitis.Long-acting plasma-bound sulfonamide used for respiratory and urinary tract infections and also for malaria.Sulfametopyrazine is a sulfonamide antibiotic. The sulfonamides are synthetic bacteriostatic antibiotics with a wide spectrum against most gram-positive and many gram-negative organisms. However, many strains of an individual species may be resistant. Sulfonamides inhibit multiplication of bacteria by acting as competitive inhibitors of p-aminobenzoic acid in the folic acid metabolism cycle. Bacterial sensitivity is the same for the various sulfonamides, and resistance to one sulfonamide indicates resistance to all. Most sulfonamides are readily absorbed orally. However, parenteral administration is difficult, since the soluble sulfonamide salts are highly alkaline and irritating to the tissues. The sulfonamides are widely distributed throughout all tissues. High levels are achieved in pleural, peritoneal, synovial, and ocular fluids. Although these drugs are no longer used to treat meningitis, CSF levels are high in meningeal infections. Their antibacterial action is inhibited by pus.Sulfametopyrazine is a competitive inhibitor of the bacterial  enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase. Para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), a substrate of the enzyme is prevented  from binding. The inhibited reaction is necessary in these organisms for the synthesis of folic acid."
410,"Epinephrine injection is indicated in the emergency treatment of type I allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. It is also used to increase mean arterial blood pressure in adult patients with hypotension associated with septic shock.[L41260]    Epinephrine's cardiac effects may be of use in restoring cardiac rhythm in cardiac arrest due to various causes but is not used in cardiac failure or in hemorrhagic, traumatic, or cardiogenic shock [F1247].    Epinephrine is used as a hemostatic agent. It is also used in treating mucosal congestion of hay fever, rhinitis, and acute sinusitis; to relieve bronchial asthmatic paroxysms; in syncope due to complete heart block or carotid sinus hypersensitivity; for symptomatic relief of serum sickness, urticaria, angioneurotic edema; for resuscitation in cardiac arrest following anesthetic accidents; in simple (open angle) glaucoma; for relaxation of uterine musculature and to inhibit uterine contractions. Epinephrine injection can be utilized to prolong the action of local anesthetics [F1247].    In addition to the above, epinephrine is used as an over the counter (OTC) agent for the intermittent symptoms of asthma, such as wheezing, tightness of chest and shortness of breath [F2131].  It is also used for the maintenance of mydriasis during intraocular surgery [L4825].Epinephrine, also known as _adrenaline_, is a hormone and neurotransmitter and produced by the adrenal glands that can also be used as a drug due to its various important functions. Though it has long been used in the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions, epinephrine in the auto-injector form (EpiPen) has been available since 1987 in the USA. Many new products/biosimilars and dosage routes have been approved under various names over the last several decades [L4355], [L4356], [L4358].  On August 16, 2018, Teva Pharmaceuticals USA gained approval to market its generic epinephrine auto-injector in 0.3 mg and 0.15 mg strengths [L4353]. Dosage delivery routes for epinephrine include intravenous, inhalation, nebulization, intramuscular injection, and subcutaneous injection.    In general, the most common uses of parenteral epinephrine are to relieve respiratory distress due to bronchospasm, to provide rapid relief of hypersensitivity (anaphylactic or anaphylactoid) reactions to drugs, animal serums and other allergens, and to prolong the action of infiltration anesthetics [F2136]. In addition to the above functions, epinephrine is the primary drug administered during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to reverse cardiac arrest [A37697], [A37699].  It can be used in severe cases of croup [L4824].Epinephrine is a sympathomimetic drug. It causes an adrenergic receptive mechanism on effector cells and mimics all actions of the sympathetic nervous system except those on the facial arteries and sweat glands [F1247].     Important effects of epinephrine include increased heart rate, myocardial contractility, and renin release via beta-1 receptors. Beta-2 effects produce bronchodilation which may be useful as an adjunct treatment of asthma exacerbations as well as vasodilation, tocolysis, and increased aqueous humor production [L4825]. In croup, nebulized epinephrine is associated with both clinically and statistically significant transient reduction of croup symptoms 30 minutes post-treatment [A40032]. Epinephrine also alleviates pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema and may be helpful in relieving gastrointestinal and genitourinary symptoms associated with anaphylaxis because of its relaxing effects on the smooth muscle of the stomach, intestine, uterus, and urinary bladder [FDA label].Epinephrine acts on alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors. Epinephrine acts on alpha and beta receptors and is the strongest alpha receptor activator [F1247]. Through its action on alpha-adrenergic receptors, epinephrine minimizes the vasodilation and increased the vascular permeability that occurs during anaphylaxis, which can cause the loss of intravascular fluid volume as well as hypotension.  Epinephrine relaxes the smooth muscle of the bronchi and iris and is a histamine antagonist, rendering it useful in treating the manifestations of allergic reactions and associated conditions [F2136]. This drug also produces an increase in blood sugar and increases glycogenolysis in the liver [F1247]. Through its action on beta-adrenergic receptors, epinephrine leads to bronchial smooth muscle relaxation that helps to relieve bronchospasm, wheezing, and dyspnea that may occur during anaphylaxis [FDA label]."

The number of PBPs differs between bacteria, in which some are considered essential and others redundant. In general, inhibition of one or more essential PBPs results in impaired cell wall homeostasis, loss of cell integrity, and is ultimately bactericidal.[A232920, A232925, A232930]    Cefixime is a cephalosporin and cephalosporins work by using their beta-lactam rings to inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to the penicillin-binding proteins transpeptidases on bacteria.[A262995,A262945,A262950] The inhibition of synthesis of the bacteria cell wall will cause lysis, particularly in fast growing organisms such as bacteria.[A262945] Specifically, cephalosporins inhibit penicillin-sensitive enzymes responsible for the final 3D structure of the bacterial cell wall which in turn inhibit bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan synthesis.[T894, T322] "
414,"For treatment of NIDDM in conjunction with diet and exercise. Chlorpropamide is an oral antihyperglycemic agent used for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It belongs to the sulfonylurea class of insulin secretagogues, which act by stimulating β cells of the pancreas to release insulin. Sulfonylureas increase both basal insulin secretion and meal-stimulated insulin release. Medications in this class differ in their dose, rate of absorption, duration of action, route of elimination and binding site on their target pancreatic β cell receptor. Sulfonylureas also increase peripheral glucose utilization, decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis and may increase the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors. Sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain, though less so than insulin. Due to their mechanism of action, sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia and require consistent food intake to decrease this risk. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased in elderly, debilitated and malnourished individuals. Chlorpropamide is not recommended for the treatment of NIDDM as it increases blood pressure and the risk of retinopathy (UKPDS-33). Up to 80% of the single oral dose of chlorpropramide is metabolized, likely in the liver; 80-90% of the dose is excreted in urine as unchanged drug and metabolites. Renal and hepatic dysfunction may increase the risk of hypoglycemia.Chlorpropamide, a second-generation sulfonylurea antidiabetic agent, is used with diet to lower blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes mellitus type II. Chlorpropamide is twice as potent as the related second-generation agent glipizide.Sulfonylureas such as chlorpropamide bind to ATP-sensitive potassium channels on the pancreatic cell surface, reducing potassium conductance and causing depolarization of the membrane. Depolarization stimulates calcium ion influx through voltage-sensitive calcium channels, raising intracellular concentrations of calcium ions, which induces the secretion, or exocytosis, of insulin."

Animal and human Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies with Aprepitant have shown that it crosses the blood brain barrier and occupies brain NK1 receptors. Animal and human studies show that Aprepitant augments the antiemetic activity of the 5-HT<sub>3</sub>-receptor antagonist ondansetron and the corticosteroid  ethasone and inhibits both the acute and delayed phases of cisplatin induced emesis."
416,"Galantamine is indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer’s type.[L13571]Galantamine is a tertiary alkaloid and reversible, competitive inhibitor of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme, which is a widely studied therapeutic target used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.[A1018] First characterized in the early 1950s, galantamine is a tertiary alkaloid that was extracted from botanical sources, such as _Galanthus nivalis_.[A201968] Galantamine was first studied in paralytic and neuropathic conditions, such as myopathies and postpolio paralytic conditions, and for reversal of neuromuscular blockade.[A182993,A201968] Following the discovery of its AChE-inhibiting properties, the cognitive effects of galantamine were studied in a wide variety of psychiatric disorders such as mild cognitive impairment, cognitive impairment in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and autism; however, re-development of the drug for Alzheimer’s disease did not commence until the early 1990s due to difficulties in extraction and synthesis.[A201968] Galantamine blocks the breakdown of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft, thereby increasing acetylcholine neurotransmission. It also acts as an allosteric modulator of the nicotinic receptor, giving its dual mechanism of action clinical significance.[A182993]    The drug was approved by the FDA in 2001 for the treatment of mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer's type. As Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, galantamine is not known to alter the course of the underlying dementing process. Galantamine works to block the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft, thereby enhancing cholinergic neuron function and signalling. Under this hypothesized mechanism of action, the therapeutic effects of galantamine may decrease as the disease progression advances and fewer cholinergic neurons remain functionally intact.[L13571] It is therefore not considered to be a disease-modifying drug.[A203558] Galantamine is marketed under the brand name Razadyne, and is available as oral immediate- and extended-release tablets and solution.[L13571]Galantamine is a competitive and reversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase that works to increase acetylcholine levels.[L13571]  Galantamine acts both centrally and peripherally to inhibit both muscle and brain acetylcholinesterase, thereby increasing cholinergic tone.[A201968] Galantamine is also a positive allosteric modulator of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.[A1022,A201968] As dementia is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, galatamine has a negligible effect in altering the course of the underlying process of dementia [L13571] and may exert its therapeutic effectiveness for a short period of time.[A203558] However, galantamine promoted improvements in cognition, global function, activities of daily living, and behavioural symptoms in clinical studies of Alzheimer’s disease.[A1018,A182993]    Galantamine exhibited therapeutic efficacy in studies of vascular dementia and Alzheimer’s disease with cerebrovascular disease.[A182993] In one study, galantamine reversed scopolamine-induced acute anticholinergic syndrome that was characterized by drowsiness, disorientation, and delirium.[A201968]Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by progressive, irreversible degeneration of acetylcholine-producing neurons, cognitive impairment, and the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques.[A182993,A203558] The cholinergic system plays a critical role in memory, alongside other important neural functions such as attention, learning, stress response, wakefulness and sleep, and sensory information. Studies show that acetylcholine (ACh) is involved in the modulation of acquisition, encoding, consolidation, reconsolidation, extinction, and retrieval of memory. The gradual loss of cholinergic neurons in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) may, therefore, contribute to the memory loss exhibited by AD patients.[A203558]     Acetylcholinesterase is secreted by cholinergic neurons to rapidly hydrolyze ACh at the synaptic cleft to release acetate and choline. Choline is later recycled back into the presynaptic cholinergic neuron via reuptake by the high-affinity choline transporter. There is some evidence demonstrating the potential involvement of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme in the formation of amyloid fibrils.[A203558] Galantamine competitively and reversibly inhibits the anticholinesterase enzyme in the CNS (namely in the frontal cortex and hippocampal regions) [A1022] by binding to the choline-binding site and acyl-binding pocket of the enzyme active site.[A1019] By blocking the breakdown of ACh, galantamine enhances ACh levels in the synaptic cleft.[A203558]     Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) in the CNS are mostly expressed at the presynaptic neuronal membrane to control the release of multiple neurotransmitters, such as ACh, glutamate, GABA, dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine.[A182993,A203558] Agonists of nAChRs improve performance in cognitive tasks, while antagonists of nAChR impair cognitive processes.[A203558] Some studies show a decrease in the expression and activity of nAChRs in patients with AD, which may explain the reduction in central cholinergic neurotransmission in these patients.[A1022] Galantamine binds to nAChRs at the allosteric site,[A182993,A203591] leading to a conformational change of the receptor, increased ACh release, and increased activity of neighbouring glutaminergic and serotoninergic neurons.[A182993] The modulation of nAChRs facilitates both excitatory and inhibitory cholinergic transmissions in brain tissues and increases receptor sensitivity. The modulated release of other neurotransmitters by galantamine may also contribute to the upregulation of nAChRs and amelioration of behavioural symptoms in AD.[A182993]"
417,"Tamoxifen is indicated to treat estrogen receptor positive metastatic breast cancer in adults, as an adjuvant in the treatment of early stage estrogen receptor positive breast cancer in adults, to reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer after surgery and radiation in adult women with ductal carcinoma in situ.[L7802]Tamoxifen is a non-steroidal antiestrogen used to treat estrogen receptor positive breast cancers as well as prevent the incidence of breast cancer in high risk populations.[A1025,L7799,L7802] Tamoxifen is used alone or as an adjuvant in these treatments.[L7799,L7802] Tamoxifen may no longer be the preferred treatment for these types of cancers as patients generally have better survival, side effect profiles, and compliance with [anastrozole].[A1026]    Tamoxifen was granted FDA approval on 30 December 1977.[L7799]Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that inhibits growth and promotes apoptosis in estrogen receptor positive tumors.[A1025,A182195] It has a long duration of action as the active metabolite N-desmethyltamoxifen has a half life of approximately 2 weeks.[L7799,L7802] It has a narrow therapeutic index as higher doses can lead to breathing difficulty or convulsions.[L7799,L7802] Tamoxifen administration is also associated with an increased incidence of uterine malignancies.[L7799,L7802]Tamoxifen competitively inhibits estrogen binding to its receptor, which is critical for it's activity in breast cancer cells.[A1025] Tamoxifen leads to a decrease in tumor growth factor α and insulin-like growth factor 1, and an increase in sex hormone binding globulin.[A1025] The increase in sex hormon binding globulin limits the amount of freely available estradiol.[A1025] These changes reduce levels of factors that stimulate tumor growth.[A1025]    Tamoxifen has also been shown to induce apoptosis in estrogen receptor positive cells.[A182195] This action is thought to be the result of inhibition of protein kinase C, which prevents DNA synthesis.[A182195] Alternate theories for the apoptotic effect of tamoxifen comes from the approximately 3 fold increase in intracellular and mitochondrial calcium ion levels after administration or the induction of tumor growth factor β.[A182195]"
418,"For use in the eye to treat certain types of glaucoma and other eye conditions, such as accommodative esotropia.An irreversible cholinesterase inhibitor with actions similar to those of echothiophate. It is a powerful miotic used mainly in the treatment of glaucoma. Its vapor is highly toxic and it is recommended that only solutions in arachis oil be used therapeutically. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 29th ed, p1330)Isoflurophate is used as ocular drops in the treatment of chronic glaucoma. Isoflurophate is an organophosphorus compound that acts as an irreversible cholinesterase inhibitor. As such, it displays parasympathomimetic effects. Isoflurophate is used in the eye to treat certain types of glaucoma and other eye conditions, such as accommodative esotropia. They may also be used in the diagnosis of certain eye conditions, such as accommodative esotropia. Isoflurophate damages the acetylcholinesterase enzyme and is therefore irreversible, however, pralidoxime can displace organophosphates such as isoflurophate from acetylcholinesterase, but only if administered before isoflurophate damages (alkylates) the enzyme.The mechanism of isoflurophate's action involves the irreversible inhibition of cholinesterase."

Thioridazine was withdrawn worldwide in 2005 due to its association with cardiac arrythmias.Thioridazine is a trifluoro-methyl phenothiazine derivative intended for the management of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Thioridazine has not been shown effective in the management of behaviorial complications in patients with mental retardation.Thioridazine blocks postsynaptic mesolimbic dopaminergic D1 and D2 receptors in the brain; blocks alpha-adrenergic effect, depresses the release of hypothalamic and hypophyseal hormones and is believed to depress the reticular activating system thus affecting basal metabolism, body temperature, wakefulness, vasomotor tone, and emesis."
421,"Used to treat irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias) and maintain a normal heart rate.An antiarrhythmia agent used primarily for ventricular rhythm disturbances.Moricizine is used to treat irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias) and to maintain a normal heart rate. It acts on the heart muscle to improve the heart's rhythm. Moricizine has potent local anesthetic activity and membrane stabilizing effect. Decreases excitability, conduction velocity, and automaticity as a result of slowed atrioventricular (AV) nodal and His-Purkinje conduction. Decreases the action potential duration (APD) in Purkinje fibers; also decreases the effective refractory period (ERP) but to a lesser extent than the APD, so the ERP/APD ratio is increased. Decreases the maxiumum rate of Phase 0 depolarization (V max ), but does not affect action potential amplitude or maximum diastolic potential. Does not affect atrial, AV nodal, or left ventricular refractory periods and has minimal effect on ventricular repolarization (evidenced by the overall decrease in JT interval). Has no effect on sinoatrial (SA) nodal or intra-atrial conduction and only minimal effect on sinus cycle length and sinus node recovery time. In the Vaughan Williams classification of antiarrhythmics, moricizine is considered to be a class I agent. It has properties of class IA, IB, and IC agents but does not clearly belong to any of the three subclasses. It has less effect on the slope of phase 0 and a greater effect on action potential duration and effective refractory period than class IC agents.Moricizine works by inhibiting the rapid inward sodium current across myocardial cell membranes."

The antibiotic is without effect on bacteria, rickettsiae, and viruses.Amphotericin B is fungistatic or fungicidal depending on the concentration obtained in body fluids and the susceptibility of the fungus. The drug acts by binding to sterols (ergosterol) in the cell membrane of susceptible fungi. This creates a transmembrane channel, and the resultant change in membrane permeability allowing leakage of intracellular components. Ergosterol, the principal sterol in the fungal cytoplasmic membrane, is the target site of action of amphotericin B and the azoles. Amphotericin B, a polyene, binds irreversibly to ergosterol, resulting in disruption of membrane integrity and ultimately cell death."
423,"Midazolam has different indications depending on its formulation by the FDA.     **Nasal**     For the nasal spray formulation, midazolam is indicated for the acute treatment of intermittent, stereotypic episodes of frequent seizure activity (i.e., seizure clusters, acute repetitive seizures) that are distinct from a patient’s usual seizure pattern in patients with epilepsy 12 years of age and older.[L44773]     **Intravenous**     For the intravenous injection formulation, midazolam is indicated as an agent for sedation/anxiolysis/amnesia and prior to or during diagnostic, therapeutic or endoscopic procedures, such as bronchoscopy, gastroscopy, cystoscopy, coronary angiography, cardiac catheterization, oncology procedures, radiologic procedures, suture of lacerations and other procedures either alone or in combination with other CNS depressants.[L12981] The sedative, anxiolytic and amnestic use of midazolam can also be employed pre-operatively.[L12981] It can also be indicated for induction of general anesthesia, before administration of other anesthetic agents or as a component of intravenous supplementation of nitrous oxide and oxygen for a balanced anesthesia.[L12981] A relatively narrower dose range of midazolam and a shorter period of induction can be achieved if midazolam is combined with narcotic premedication.[L12981] Finally, midazolam can be indicated as a continous intravenous infusion for sedation of intubated and mechanically ventilated patients as a component of anesthesia or during treatment in a critical care setting.[L12981]    **Intramuscular**     For the intramusuclar injection formulation, midazolam is indicated for preoperative sedation/anxiolysis/amnesia or for treatment of status epilepticus in adults.[L12981,L45048]    **Oral**    Midazolam syrup is indicated for use in pediatric patients for sedation, anxiolysis and amnesia prior to diagnostic, therapeutic or endoscopic procedures or before induction of anesthesia. It is only approved in monitored settings only and not for chronic or home use.[L5092]    In Europe, a buccal formulation of midazolam is also approved for the treatment of prolonged, acute, convulsive seizures in infants, toddlers, children and adolescents (from 3 months to < 18 years). For infants between 3-6 months of age treatment should be in a hospital setting where monitoring is possible and resuscitation equipment is available.[L45053]  Midazolam is a short-acting hypnotic-sedative drug with anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, anticonvulsant, sedative, hypnotic, and amnesic properties.[A173842] It belongs to a class of drugs called _benzodiazepines_. This drug is unique from others in this class due to its rapid onset of effects and short duration of action.[A173842] Midazolam is available by oral, rectal, intranasal, intramuscular (IM), and intravenous (IV) routes and has been used in various biomedical applications, including dentistry, cardiac surgery, and endoscopic procedures as pre-anesthetic medication, and as an adjunct to local anesthesia.[F2977]    This drug was initially approved by the US FDA in 1985, and has been approved for various indications since.[L45098] In late 2018, the intramuscular preparation was approved by the FDA for the treatment of status epilepticus in adults.[L45098] In May 2019, the nasal spray of midazolam was approved for the acute treatment of distinctive intermittent, stereotypic seizure episodes in patients 12 years of age and older.[A257153] Midazolam is considered a schedule IV drug in the United States due to the low potential for abuse and low risk of dependence.[L5074]**General effects**    Midazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine central nervous system (CNS) depressant. Pharmacodynamic properties of midazolam and its metabolites, which are similar to those of other benzodiazepine drugs, include sedative, anxiolytic, amnestic, muscle relaxant, as well as hypnotic activities.[F2434] Benzodiazepines enhance the inhibitory action of the amino acid neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).  Receptors for GABA are targeted by many important drugs that affect GABA function and are commonly used in the treatment of anxiety disorder, epilepsy, insomnia, spasticity, and aggressive behavior.[A173854]    **Sedation and memory**    The onset of sedation after intramuscular administration in adults is 15 minutes, with maximal sedation occurring 30-60 minutes after injection.[FDA label] In one study of adults, when tested the following day, 73% of the patients who were administered midazolam intramuscularly had no recollection of memory cards shown 30 minutes following drug administration; 40% had no recollection of the memory cards shown 60 minutes after drug administration. Onset time of sedative effects in pediatric patients begins within 5 minutes and peaks at 15-30 minutes depending upon the dose administered. In the pediatric population, up to 85% had no memory of pictures shown after receiving intramuscular midazolam compared to 5% of the placebo control group.[F2434]    Sedation in both adult and pediatric patients is reached within 3 to 5 minutes post intravenous (IV) injection. The time of onset is affected by the dose administered and the simultaneous administration of narcotic pre-medication. Seventy-one (71%) percent of the adult patients in clinical endoscopy studies had no memory of insertion of the endoscope; 82% of the patients had no memory of withdrawal of the endoscope.[L12981]    **Anesthesia induction**    When midazolam is administered intravenously (IV) for anesthetic induction, induction of anesthesia occurs in about 1.5 minutes when narcotic pre-medication has been given and in 2 to 2.5 minutes without narcotic pre-medication/ other sedative pre-medication. Impairment in a memory test was observed in 90% of the patients.[L12981]The actions of benzodiazepines such as midazolam are mediated through the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is one of the major inhibitory neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. Benzodiazepines increase the activity of GABA, thereby producing a sedating effect, relaxing skeletal muscles, and inducing sleep, anesthesia, and amnesia. Benzodiazepines bind to the benzodiazepine site on GABA-A receptors, which potentiates the effects of GABA by increasing the frequency of chloride channel opening.[F2434] These receptors have been identified in different body tissues including the heart and skeletal muscle, although mainly appear to be present in the central nervous system.[A173842]"
424,"Inhaled tobramycin is indicated for the management of cystic fibrosis patients with _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, but is not recommended in patients under six years of age, those with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) <25 or >80% predicted, or in those with _Burkholderia cepacia_.[L32739,L45364]    Tobramycin applied topically to the eyes is indicated for the treatment of external eye (and adjoining structure) infections by susceptible bacteria.[L32744]     Tobramycin injection is indicated in adult and pediatric patients for the treatment of serious bacterial infections, including septicemia (caused by _P. aeruginosa_, _Escherichia coli_, and _Klebsiella_ spp.), lower respiratory tract infections (caused by _P. aeruginosa_, _Klebsiella_ spp., _Enterobacter_ spp., _Serratia_ spp., _E. coli_, and _Staphylococcus aureus_, both penicillinase and non-penicillinase-producing strains), serious central-nervous-system infections (meningitis, caused by susceptible organisms), intra-abdominal infections including peritonitis (caused by _E. coli_, _Klebsiella_ spp., and _Enterobacter_ spp.), skin, bone, and skin structure infections (caused by _P. aeruginosa_, _Proteus_ spp., _E. coli_, _Klebsiella_ spp., _Enterobacter_ spp., _Serratia_ spp. and _S. aureus_), and complicated and recurrent urinary tract infections (caused by _P. aeruginosa_, _Proteus_ spp., _E. coli_, _Klebsiella_ spp., _Enterobacter_ spp., _Serratia_ spp., _S. aureus_, _Providencia_ spp., and _Citrobacter_ spp.).[L32749] Aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, should generally not be used in uncomplicated urinary tract infections or staphylococcal infections unless less toxic antibiotics cannot be used and the bacteria in question are known to be sensitive to aminoglycosides.[L32749,L45359]    As with all antibiotics, tobramycin use should be limited to cases where bacterial infections are known or strongly suspected to be caused by sensitive organisms, and the possible emergence of resistance should be monitored closely.[L32739,L32744,L32749]Aminoglycosides, many of which are derived directly from _Streptomyces_ spp., are concentration-dependent bactericidal antibiotics with a broad spectrum of activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms.[A232294] Inhaled tobramycin is notable for its use in treating chronic _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ infections in cystic fibrosis patients, as _P. aeruginosa_ is notoriously inherently resistant to many antibiotics.[A232294, A232299, L32739] However, tobramycin can also be administered intravenously and topically to treat a variety of infections caused by susceptible bacteria.[L32744, L32749] Its use is limited in some cases by characteristic toxicities such as nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, yet it remains a valuable option in the face of growing resistance to front-line antibiotics such as β-lactams and cephalosporins.[A232294, A232349, L32739, L32749]    Tobramycin was approved by the FDA in 1975 and is currently available in a variety of forms for administration by inhalation, injection, and external application to the eye (ophthalmic).[L32739, L32744, L32749]Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic derived from the actinomycete _Streptomyces tenebrarius_.[L32749] It has a broad spectrum of activity against Gram-negative bacteria, including _Enterobacteriaceae_, _Escherichia coli_, _Klebsiella pneumoniae_, _Morganella morganii_, _Moraxella lacunata_, _Proteus_ spp., _Haemophilus_ spp., _Acinetobacter_ spp., _Neisseria_ spp., and, importantly, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_. Aminoglycosides also generally retain activity against the biothreat agents _Yersinia pestis_ and _Francisella tularensis_. In addition, aminoglycosides are active against some Gram-positive bacteria such as _Staphylococcus_ spp., including methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant strains, _Streptococcus_ spp., and _Mycobacterium_ spp.[A232294, L32744]    Like other aminoglycosides, tobramycin is taken up and retained by proximal tubule and cochlear cells in the kidney and ear, respectively, and hence carries a risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity.[A232294, L32749] There is also a risk of neuromuscular block, which may be more pronounced in patients with preexisting neuromuscular disorders such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson's disease.[A232294, L32739, L32749] Aminoglycosides can cross the placenta, resulting in total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in babies born to mothers who were administered an aminoglycoside during pregnancy.[L32739, L32749] Due to the low systemic absorption of inhaled and topical tobramycin formulations, these effects are more pronounced with injected tobramycin than with other formulations.[L32739, L32744, L32749] However, all formulations carry a risk of hypersensitivity reactions, including potentially fatal cutaneous reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis.[L32739, L32744, L32749]Tobramycin is a 4,6-disubstituted 2-deoxystreptamine (DOS) ring-containing aminoglycoside antibiotic with activity against various Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria.[L32739, L32744, L32749] The mechanism of action of tobramycin has not been unambiguously elucidated, and some insights into its mechanism rely on results using similar aminoglycosides. In general, like other aminoglycosides, tobramycin is bactericidal and exhibits both immediate and delayed killing, which are attributed to different mechanisms, as outlined below.[A232294, A232299]    Aminoglycosides are polycationic at physiological pH, such that they readily bind to bacterial membranes (""ionic binding""); this includes binding to lipopolysaccharide and phospholipids within the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and to teichoic acid and phospholipids within the cell membrane of Gram-positive bacteria. This binding displaces divalent cations and increases membrane permeability, which allows aminoglycoside entry.[A232294, A232304, A232309, A232314] Additional aminoglycoside entry (""energy-dependent phase I"") into the cytoplasm requires the proton-motive force, allowing access of the aminoglycoside to its primary intracellular target of the bacterial 30S ribosome.[A232294, A232314] Mistranslated proteins produced as a result of aminoglycoside binding to the ribosome (see below) integrate into and disrupt the cell membrane, which allows more of the aminoglycoside into the cell (""energy-dependent phase II"").[A232294, A232314, A232319] Hence, tobramycin and other aminoglycosides have both immediate bactericidal effects through membrane disruption and delayed bactericidal effects through impaired protein synthesis; observed experimental data and mathematical modelling support this two-mechanism model.[A232294, A232299]    Inhibition of protein synthesis was the first recognized effect of aminoglycoside antibiotics. Structural and cell biological studies suggest that aminoglycosides bind to the 16S rRNA in helix 44 (h44), near the A site of the 30S ribosomal subunit, altering interactions between h44 and h45. This binding also displaces two important residues, A1492 and A1493, from h44, mimicking normal conformational changes that occur with successful codon-anticodon pairing in the A site.[A232324, A232329] Overall, aminoglycoside binding has several negative effects, including inhibiting translation initiation and elongation and ribosome recycling.[A232294, A232334, A232339] Recent evidence suggests that the latter effect is due to a cryptic second binding site situated in h69 of the 23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit.[A232329, A232339] Also, by stabilizing a conformation that mimics correct codon-anticodon pairing, aminoglycosides promote error-prone translation;[A232344] mistranslated proteins can incorporate into the cell membrane, inducing the damage discussed above.[A232294, A232319]    Although direct mutation of the 16S rRNA is a rare resistance mechanism, due to the gene being present in numerous copies, posttranscriptional 16S rRNA modification by 16S rRNA methyltransferases (16S-RMTases) at the N7 position of G1405 or the N1 position of A1408 are common resistance mechanisms in aminoglycoside-resistant bacteria.[A232294, A232349] These mutants also further support the proposed mechanism of action of aminoglycosides. Direct modification of the aminoglycoside itself through acetylation, adenylation, and phosphorylation by aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (AMEs) are also commonly encountered resistance mutations.[A232294, A232349] Finally, due to the requirement for active transport of aminoglycosides across bacterial membranes, they are not active against obligately anaerobic bacteria.[A232294]"

It is also indicated for the treatment of salt-losing androgenital syndrome.[L8971]Fludrocortisone is a synthetic mineralocorticoid used in conjunction with [hydrocortisone] to replace missing endogenous corticosteroids in patients with adrenal insufficiency.[A187169,A187187] It is functionally similar to [aldosterone], the body's primary endogenous mineralocorticoid, and is structurally analogous to [cortisol], differing only by a fluorine atom at the 9-position of the steroid structure - this fluorination is thought to be crucial to fludrocortisone's significant mineralocorticoid potency.[A5423]Fludrocortisone is a synthetic mineralocorticoid used to replace endogenous [aldosterone] in conditions resulting in missing or inadequate endogenous synthesis.[L8971,L8974] It acts on the kidneys to increase both sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion.[T28,A187187] As its effects are exerted at the transcriptional level, a single dose of fludrocortisone may work over the course of 1-2 days[L8974] despite a relatively short plasma half-life.[A187159,A187169,A187181] Like other systemic corticosteroids, fludrocortisone may mask signs of infection by depressing the normal immune response - infections occurring during fludrocortisone therapy should be promptly treated with appropriate antimicrobial therapy.[L8971]The main endogenous mineralocorticoid, aldosterone, is produced in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex - it acts on mineralocorticoid receptors in the kidneys to increase sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, which in turn helps to regulate plasma electrolyte composition and blood pressure.[T28] In conditions of adrenal insufficiency, such as Addison’s disease, aldosterone is not produced (or is produced in insufficient quantities) and must be replaced by exogenous mineralocorticoids such as fludrocortisone.[A187187]    Fludrocortisone binding to mineralocorticoid receptors causes alterations to DNA transcription and translation of proteins that result in an increased density of sodium channels on the apical side of renal tubule cells and an increased density of Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase on the basolateral side.[T28] These increases in receptor density result in increased plasma sodium concentrations, and thus increased blood pressure, as well as a decreased plasma potassium concentration. Fludrocortisone may also exert a direct effect on plasma sodium levels via action at the Na<sup>+</sup>-H<sup>+</sup> exchanger found in the apical membrane of renal tubule cells.[T28]    Fludrocortisone also acts on glucocorticoid receptors, albeit with a much lower affinity - the glucocorticoid potency of fludrocortisone is approximately 5-10 times that of endogenous cortisol, whereas its mineralocorticoid potency is 200-400 times greater.[A5423]"
426,"Mycophenolate mofetil is indicated in combination with other immunosuppressants to prevent the rejection of kidney, heart, or liver transplants in adult and pediatric patients �? months old.[L42020] Mycophenolate mofetil may also be used off-label as a second-line treatment for autoimmune hepatitis that has not responded adequately to first-line therapy.[A180814] Other off-label uses of this drug include lupus-associated nephritis and dermatitis in children.[A180817]Mycophenolate mofetil, also known as MMF or CellCept, is a prodrug of mycophenolic acid, and classified as a reversible inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH).[A180805] This drug is an immunosuppressant combined with drugs such as [Cyclosporine] and corticosteroids to prevent organ rejection after hepatic, renal, and cardiac transplants.[L7363] It is marketed by Roche Pharmaceuticals and was granted FDA approval for the prophylaxis of transplant rejection in 1995.[A180826] In addition to the above uses, mycophenolate mofetil has also been studied for the treatment of nephritis and other complications of autoimmune diseases. Unlike another immunosuppressant class, the calcineurin inhibitors, MMF generally does not cause nephrotoxicity or fibrosis.[A180799,A180805]    Previously, mycophenolic acid (MPA) was administered to individuals with autoimmune diseases beginning in the 1970s, but was discontinued due to gastrointestinal effects and concerns over carcinogenicity.[A180826] The new semi-synthetic 2-morpholinoethyl ester of MPA was synthesized to avoid the gastrointestinal effects associated with the administration of MPA. It demonstrates an increased bioavailability, a higher efficacy, and reduced gastrointestinal effects when compared to MPA.[A180826]Mycophenolate mofetil is a prodrug of mycophenolic acid (MPA). The active form of mycophenolate, MPA, prevents the proliferation of immune cells and the formation of antibodies that cause transplant rejection.[A180805] The above effects lead to higher rates of successful transplantation, avoiding the devastating effects of graft rejection.    The active metabolite of mycophenolate, mycophenolic acid, prevents T-cell and B-cell proliferation and the production of cytotoxic T-cells and antibodies. Lymphocyte and monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells of blood vessels that normally part of inflammation is prevented via the glycosylation of cell adhesion molecules by MPA.[A180892] MPA inhibits de novo purine biosynthesis (that promotes immune cell proliferation) by inhibiting inosine 5�?monophosphate dehydrogenase enzyme (IMPDH), with a preferential inhibition of IMPDH II.[A180826] IMPDH normally transforms inosine monophosphate (IMP) to xanthine monophosphate (XMP), a metabolite contributing to the production of guanosine triphosphate (GTP).[A180799,A180805,A180817] GTP is an important molecule for the synthesis of ribonucleic acid (RNA), deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and protein. As a result of the above cascade of effects, mycophenolate mofetil reduces de-novo production of guanosine nucleotides, interfering with the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and protein required for immune cell production.[A180826] Further contributing to the above anti-inflammatory effects, MMF depletes tetrahydrobiopterin, causing the decreased function of inducible nitric oxide synthase enzyme, in turn decreasing the production of peroxynitrite, a molecule that promotes inflammation.[A180907]"
427,For treatment of severe infections caused by susceptible bacteria.A cephalorsporin antibiotic that is no longer commonly used.Cephaloglycin is an antibiotic related to cephalosporin but no longer in common use. It is an orally absorbed derivative of cephalosporin C.The bactericidal activity of cephaloglycin results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs).
428,"For short-term and intermittent use in patients with recurring insomnia and poor sleeping habitsA benzodiazepine derivative used mainly as a hypnotic.Flurazepam, a benzodiazepine derivative, is a hypnotic agent which does not appear to decrease dream time as measured by rapid eye movements (REM). Furthermore, it decreases sleep latency and number of awakenings for a consequent increase in total sleep time.Flurazepam binds to an allosteric site on GABA-A receptors. Binding potentiates the action of GABA on GABA-A receptors by opening the chloride channel within the receptor, causing chloride influx and hyperpolarization."
429,"For remission induction in acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (myelogenous, monocytic, erythroid) of adults and for remission induction in acute lymphocytic leukemia of children and adults.    Daunorubicin is indicated in combination with [cytarabine] for the treatment of newly-diagnosed therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC) in adults and pediatric patients 1 year and older.[L32843]A very toxic anthracycline aminoglycoside antineoplastic isolated from Streptomyces peucetius and others, used in treatment of leukemia and other neoplasms.Daunorubicin is an anthracycline antibiotic and antineoplastic agent.[L32843] It acts by inhibiting cellular reproduction through interference with DNA replication although it may contribute to the induction of cell death by increasing oxidative stress through the generation of reactive oxygen species and free radicals. As an antineoplastic agent, daunorubicin carries significant toxicities including cytopenias, hepatotoxicity, and extravasation reactions. Like other anthracyclines, daunorubicin also exhibits cardiotoxicity in proportion with the cumulative dose received over time.Daunorubicin has antimitotic and cytotoxic activity through a number of proposed mechanisms of action: Daunorubicin forms complexes with DNA by intercalation between base pairs, and it inhibits topoisomerase II activity by stabilizing the DNA-topoisomerase II complex, preventing the religation portion of the ligation-religation reaction that topoisomerase II catalyzes."
430,"Furosemide is indicated for the treatment of edema associated with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver, and renal disease, including the nephrotic syndrome, in adults and pediatric patients.[L7958]     Oral furosemide is indicated alone for the management of mild to moderate hypertension or severe hypertension in combination with other antihypertensive medications.[L9659]    Intravenous furosemide is indicated as adjunctive therapy in acute pulmonary edema when a rapid onset of diuresis is desired.[L7958]    Subcutaneous furosemide is indicated for the treatment of congestion due to fluid overload in adults with NYHA Class II/III chronic heart failure. This drug formulation is not indicated for emergency situations or in patients with acute pulmonary edema.[L43408]Furosemide is a potent loop diuretic that acts on the kidneys to ultimately increase water loss from the body. It is an anthranilic acid derivative.[L7958] Furosemide is used for edema secondary to various clinical conditions, such as congestive heart failure exacerbation, liver failure, renal failure, and high blood pressure.[L7961] It mainly works by inhibiting electrolyte reabsorption from the kidneys and enhancing the excretion of water from the body. Furosemide has a fast onset and short duration of action and has been used safely and effectively in both pediatric and adult patients.[A182495] The use of furosemide is particularly beneficial in clinical settings that require a drug with a higher diuretic potential. In addition to oral formulations, the solution for intravenous and intramuscular administration is also available, which is typically limited to patients who are unable to take oral medication or for patients in emergency clinical situations.[L7958]Furosemide manages hypertension and edema associated with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, and renal disease, including the nephrotic syndrome. Furosemide is a potent loop diuretic that works to increase the excretion of Na+ and water by the kidneys by inhibiting their reabsorption from the proximal and distal tubules, as well as the loop of Henle.[L7958] It works directly acts on the cells of the nephron and indirectly modifies the content of the renal filtrate.[T28] Ultimately, furosemide increases the urine output by the kidney. Protein-bound furosemide is delivered to its site of action in the kidneys and secreted via active secretion by nonspecific organic transporters expressed at the luminal site of action.[A31831,L7958]     Following oral administration, the onset of the diuretic effect is about 1 and 1.5 hours [L7958], and the peak effect is reached within the first 2 hours.[L7961] The duration of effect following oral administration is about 4-6 hours but may last up to 8 hours.[L9659] Following intravenous administration, the onset of effect is within 5 minutes, and the peak effect is reached within 30 minutes. The duration of action following intravenous administration is approximately 2 hours. Following intramuscular administration, the onset of action is somewhat delayed.[L7958]Furosemide promotes diuresis by blocking tubular reabsorption of sodium and chloride in the proximal and distal tubules, as well as in the thick ascending loop of Henle. This diuretic effect is achieved through the competitive inhibition of sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporters (NKCC2) expressed along these tubules in the nephron, preventing the transport of sodium ions from the lumenal side into the basolateral side for reabsorption. This inhibition results in increased excretion of water along with sodium, chloride, magnesium, calcium, hydrogen, and potassium ions.[L7961] As with other loop diuretics, furosemide decreases the excretion of uric acid.[T28]     Furosemide exerts direct vasodilatory effects, which results in its therapeutic effectiveness in the treatment of acute pulmonary edema. Vasodilation leads to reduced responsiveness to vasoconstrictors, such as angiotensin II and noradrenaline, and decreased production of endogenous natriuretic hormones with vasoconstricting properties. It also leads to increased production of prostaglandins with vasodilating properties. Furosemide may also open potassium channels in resistance arteries.[T28] The main mechanism of action of furosemide is independent of its inhibitory effect on carbonic anhydrase and aldosterone.[L7958] "
431,"For use as therapy to abort or prevent vascular headache, e.g., migraine, migraine variants, or so called ""histaminic cephalalgia"".A vasoconstrictor found in ergot of Central Europe. It is an alpha-1 selective adrenergic agonist and is commonly used in the treatment of migraine disorders.Ergotamine is a vasoconstrictor and alpha adrenoreceptor antagonist. The pharmacological properties of ergotamine are extremely complex; some of its actions are unrelated to each other, and even mutually antagonistic. The drug has partial agonist and/or antagonist activity against tryptaminergic, dopaminergic and alpha adrenergic receptors depending upon their site, and it is a highly active uterine stimulant. It causes constriction of peripheral and cranial blood vessels and produces depression of central vasomotor centers. The pain of a migraine attack is believed to be due to greatly increased amplitude of pulsations in the cranial arteries, especially the meningeal branches of the external carotid artery. Ergotamine reduces extracranial blood flow, causes a decline in the amplitude of pulsation in the cranial arteries, and decreases hyperperfusion of the territory of the basilar artery. It does not reduce cerebral hemispheric blood flow.Ergotamine acts on migraine by one of two proposed mechanisms: 1) activation of 5-HT1D receptors located on intracranial blood vessels, including those on arterio-venous anastomoses, leads to vasoconstriction, which correlates with the relief of migraine headache, and 2) activation of 5-HT1D receptors on sensory nerve endings of the trigeminal system results in the inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release."
432,"Nitrofurantoin is indicated to treat acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections.[L6856,L6859,L6862]Nitrofurantoin is a nitrofuran antibiotic used to treat uncomplicated urinary tract infections.[L6856,L6859,L6862] Nitrofurantoin is converted by bacterial nitroreductases to electrophilic intermediates which inhibit the citric acid cycle as well as synthesis of DNA, RNA, and protein.[A179824] This drug is more resistant to the development of bacterial resistance because it acts on many targets at once.[A179824] Nitrofurantoin is a second line treatment to [trimethoprim]/[sulfamethoxazole].[A179830]    Nitrofurantoin was granted FDA approval on 6 February 1953.[L6895]Nitrofurantoin interferes with vital processes in bacteria, which leads to their death.[A179824] Nitrofurantoin rapidly reaches therapeutic concentrations in the urine and is also cleared rapidly.[A179830]Nitrofurantoin is converted by bacterial nitroreductases to electrophilic intermediates which inhibit the citric acid cycle as well as synthesis of DNA, RNA, and protein.[A179824]"
433,"For the treatment of senile dementia, migraines of vascular origin, transient ischemia, platelet hyper-aggregability, and macular degeneration.An ergot derivative that has been used as a cerebral vasodilator and in peripheral vascular disease. It has been suggested to ameliorate cognitive deficits in cerebrovascular disease.Nicergoline is a potent vasodilator (improves brain blood flow). On the cerebral level it prompts a lowering of vascular resistance, an increase in arterial flow and stimulates the use of oxygen and glucose. Nicergoline also improves blood circulation in the lungs and limbs and has been shown to inhibit blood platelet aggregation.Nicergoline acts by inhibiting the postsynaptic alpha(1)-adrenoceptors on vascular smooth muscle. This inhibits the vasoconstrictor effect of circulating and locally released catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine), resulting in peripheral vasodilation. Therefore the mechanism of Nicergoline is to increase vascular circulation in the brain, thereby enhancing the transmission of nerve signals across the nerve fibres, which secrete acetylcholine as a neural transmitter."
434,"For improvement of survival of stable patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction <40%) and clinical evidence of congestive heart failure after an acute myocardial infarction.Eplerenone, an aldosterone receptor antagonist similar to spironolactone, has been shown to produce sustained increases in plasma renin and serum aldosterone, consistent with inhibition of the negative regulatory feedback of aldosterone on renin secretion. The resulting increased plasma renin activity and aldosterone circulating levels do not overcome the effects of eplerenone. Eplerenone selectively binds to recombinant human mineralocorticoid receptors relative to its binding to recombinant human glucocorticoid, progesterone and androgen receptors.Eplerenone, an aldosterone receptor antagonist similar to spironolactone, has been shown to produce sustained increases in plasma renin and serum aldosterone, consistent with inhibition of the negative regulatory feedback of aldosterone on renin secretion. The resulting increased plasma renin activity and aldosterone circulating levels do not overcome the effects of eplerenone. Eplerenone selectively binds to recombinant human mineralocorticoid receptors relative to its binding to recombinant human glucocorticoid, progesterone and androgen receptors.Eplerenone binds to the mineralocorticoid receptor and thereby blocks the binding of aldosterone (component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system, or RAAS). Aldosterone synthesis, which occurs primarily in the adrenal gland, is modulated by multiple factors, including angiotensin II and non-RAAS mediators such as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and potassium. Aldosterone binds to mineralocorticoid receptors in both epithelial (e.g., kidney) and nonepithelial (e.g., heart, blood vessels, and brain) tissues and increases blood pressure through induction of sodium reabsorption and possibly other mechanisms."
435,"Amprenavir is a protease inhibitor used to treat HIV infection.Amprenavir is a protease inhibitor with activity against Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1). Protease inhibitors block the part of HIV called protease. HIV-1 protease is an enzyme required for the proteolytic cleavage of the viral polyprotein precursors into the individual functional proteins found in infectious HIV-1. Amprenavir binds to the protease active site and inhibits the activity of the enzyme. This inhibition prevents cleavage of the viral polyproteins resulting in the formation of immature non-infectious viral particles. Protease inhibitors are almost always used in combination with at least two other anti-HIV drugs.Amprenavir inhibits the HIV viral proteinase enzyme which prevents cleavage of the gag-pol polyprotein, resulting in noninfectious, immature viral particles."
436,"For treatment of chronic open-angle glaucoma and acute angle-closure glaucomaA carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that is used as a diuretic and in the treatment of glaucoma.Methazolamide is topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Methazolamide is indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension who are insufficiently responsive to beta-blockers. Methazolamide is a sulfonamide derivative; however, it does not have any clinically significant antimicrobial properties. Although methazolamide achieves a high concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid, it is not-considered an effective anticonvulsant. Methazolamide has a weak and transient diuretic effect, therefore use results in an increase in urinary volume, with excretion of sodium, potassium and chloride.Methazolamide is a potent inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase. Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the ciliary processes of the eye decreases aqueous humor secretion, presumably by slowing the formation of bicarbonate ions with subsequent reduction in sodium and fluid transport."
437,"The indications for this drug are as follows:    1. As an analgesic adjunct in the maintenance of balanced general anesthesia in patients who are intubated and ventilated.    2. As a primary anesthetic agent for the induction and maintenance of anesthesia with 100% oxygen in patients undergoing major surgical procedures, in patients who are intubated and ventilated, such as cardiovascular surgery or neurosurgical procedures in the sitting position, to provide favorable myocardial and cerebral oxygen balance or when extended postoperative ventilation is anticipated.    3. For epidural administration as an analgesic combined with low dose (usually 12.5 mg per administration) bupivacaine usually during labor and vaginal delivery     4. The sublingual form is indicated for the management of acute pain in adults that is severe to warrant the use of an opioid analgesic in certified medically supervised healthcare settings, including hospitals, surgical centers, and emergency departments.    [FDA label]Sufentanil is an opioid analgesic that is used as an adjunct in anesthesia, in balanced anesthesia, and as a primary anesthetic agent.  It is administered by the intravenous, epidural and sublingual routes.     Also known as _Dsuvia_, the sublingual form is used for the management of acute pain in adults that is severe to warrant the use of an opioid analgesic in certified medically supervised healthcare settings, including hospitals, surgical centers, and emergency departments [L4717]. Consideration may be made in the future for the use of the sublingual form in the US military in cases where analgesia is required immediately [L4718].    The sublingual form, manufactured by AcelRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AcelRx), was approved on November 2, 2018 [L4717].  This route of administration is intended to be a simple, effective, non-invasive analgesic option to enable healthcare professionals to rapidly manage acute pain without difficult intravenous or epidural administration [L4717], [A39633].**Effect on the Central Nervous System (CNS)**     In clinical settings, sufentanil exerts its principal pharmacologic effects on the central nervous system. Its primary therapeutic actions are analgesia and sedation. Sufentanil may increase pain tolerance and decrease the perception of pain. This drug depresses the respiratory centers, depresses the cough reflex, and constricts the pupils [F2009], [A39637]. When used in balanced general anesthesia, sufentanil has been reported to be as much as 10 times as potent as fentanyl. When administered intravenously as a primary anesthetic agent with 100% oxygen, sufentanil is approximately 5 to 7 times as potent as fentanyl [FDA label]. High doses of intravenous sufentanil have been shown to cause muscle rigidity, likely as a result of an effect on the substantia nigra and the striate nucleus in the brain. Sleep-inducing (hypnotic) activity can be demonstrated by EEG alterations [FDA label].    **Effects on the Respiratory System**    Sufentanil may cause respiratory depression [FDA label].    **Effects on the Cardiovascular System**    Sufentanil causes peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Bradycardia may also occur [F2009]. Clinical signs or symptoms of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes and sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension [FDA label].    **Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract**    Sufentanil causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in both the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine may be delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased and lead to spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, as well as temporary elevations in serum amylase [FDA label].Sufentanil is a synthetic, potent opioid with highly selective binding to μ-opioid receptors [F2009]. These receptors are widely distributed in the human brain, spinal cord, and other tissues [A39636], [A39637].    In general, opioids decrease cAMP (affecting neural signaling pathways), decrease neurotransmitter release, and cause membrane hyperpolarization, all of which contribute to the relief of painful symptoms [A39637].    Opiate receptors are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as both positive and negative regulators of synaptic neural transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. Binding of the opiate receptor leads to the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP, located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. The release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine, and noradrenaline is then inhibited [A39637].     Opioids close N-type voltage-operated calcium channels (OP2-receptor agonist), also preventing neurotransmitter release [A39637].    Sufentanil and other opioids open calcium-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channels, resulting in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability [A39636], [A39637]. "
438,"For the treatment of HIV infection and chronic hepatitis B (HBV).A reverse transcriptase inhibitor and zalcitabine analog in which a sulfur atom replaces the 3&#39; carbon of the pentose ring. It is used to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) and hepatitis B (HBV).Lamivudine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) with activity against Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) and hepatitis B (HBV) to disrupt viral DNA synthesis. When phosphorylated, lamivudine can form active metabolites that compete for incorporation into viral DNA. Via DNA incorporation, lamivudine metabolites competitively inhibit the activity of the HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme and act as a chain terminator of DNA synthesis. Due to the lack of a 3'-OH group, incorporated nucleoside analogues prevent the formation of a 5' to 3' phosphodiester linkage that is essential for DNA chain elongation. Lamivudine is a synthetic nucleoside analogue and is phosphorylated intracellularly to its active 5'-triphosphate metabolite, lamivudine triphosphate (L-TP). This nucleoside analogue is incorporated into viral DNA by HIV reverse transcriptase and HBV polymerase, resulting in DNA chain termination."
439,"Flurbiprofen tablets are indicated for the acute or long-term symptomatic treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, osteorarthritis and anklosing spondylitis. It may also be used to treat pain associated with dysmenorrhea and mild to moderate pain accompanied by inflammation (e.g. bursitis, tendonitis, soft tissue trauma). Topical ophthalmic formulations may be used pre-operatively to prevent intraoperative miosis. Flurbiprofen, a propionic acid derivative, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAIA) with antipyretic and analgesic activity. Oral formulations of flurbiprofen may be used for the symptomatic treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and anklylosing spondylitis. Flurbiprofen may also be used topically prior to ocular surgery to prevent or reduce intraoperative miosis. Flurbiprofen is structurally and pharmacologically related to fenoprofen, ibuprofen, and ketoprofen.Flurbiprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAIA) of the propionic acid class, is structually and pharmacologically related to fenoprofen, ibuprofen, and ketoprofen, and has similar pharmacological actions to other prototypica NSAIAs. Flurbiprofen exhibits antiinflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activities. The commercially available flurbiprofen is a racemic mixture of (+)S- and (-) R-enantiomers. The S-enantiomer appears to possess most of the anti-inflammatory, while both enantiomers may possess analgesic activity.Similar to other NSAIAs, the anti-inflammatory effect of flurbiprofen occurs via reversible inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX), the enzyme responsible for the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin G2 (PGG2) and PGG2 to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) in the prostaglandin synthesis pathway. This effectively decreases the concentration of prostaglandins involved in inflammation, pain, swelling and fever. Flurbiprofen is a non-selective COX inhibitor and inhibits the activity of both COX-1 and -2. It is also one of the most potent NSAIAs in terms of prostaglandin inhibitory activity."
440,"Used in the treatment of resistant staphylococci infections.An antibiotic similar to [flucloxacillin] used in resistant staphylococci infections.Oxacillin is a penicillin beta-lactam antibiotic used in the treatment of bacterial infections caused by susceptible, usually gram-positive, organisms. The name ""penicillin"" can either refer to several variants of penicillin available, or to the group of antibiotics derived from the penicillins. Oxacillin has in vitro activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The bactericidal activity of Oxacillin results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis and is mediated through Oxacillin binding to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). Oxacillin is stable against hydrolysis by a variety of beta-lactamases, including penicillinases, and cephalosporinases and extended spectrum beta-lactamases.By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, Oxacillin inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that Oxacillin interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."
441,"Apomorphine is indicated to treat acute, intermittent treatment of hypomobility, off episodes associated with advanced Parkinson's disease.[L13919,L13922]Apomorphine is a non-ergoline dopamine D2 agonist indicated to treat hypomobility associated with Parkinson's. It was first synthesized in 1845 and first used in Parkinson's disease in 1884.[A203618] Apomorphine has also been investigated as an emetic, a sedative, a treatment for alcoholism, and a treatment of other movement disorders.[A203597,A203618]    Apomorphine was granted FDA approval on 20 April 2004.[L13919]Apomorphine is a dopaminergic agonist that may stimulate regions of the brain involved in motor control.[A203594,L13919,L13922] It has a short duration of action and a wide therapeutic index as large overdoses are necessary for significant toxicity.[L13919,L13922] Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of nausea, vomiting, daytime somnolence, hypotension, oral mucosal irritation, falls, hallucinations, psychotic-like behaviour, impulsive behaviour, withdrawal hyperpyrexia, and prolongation of the QT interval.[L13919,L13922]    Given the incidence of nausea and vomiting in patients taking apomorphine, treatment with [trimethobenzamide] may be recommended prior to or during therapy. Antiemetic pretreatment may be started three days prior to beginning therapy with apomorphine - it should only be continued as long as is necessary and generally for no longer than two months.[L41915]Apomorphine is a non-ergoline dopamine agonist with high binding affinity to dopamine D2, D3, and D5 receptors.[L13919,L13922] Stimulation of D2 receptors in the caudate-putamen, a region of the brain responsible for locomotor control, may be responsible for apomorphine's action.[A203594] However, the means by which the cellular effects of apomorphine treat hypomobility of Parkinson's remain unknown.[L13919,L13922]"
442,"Paroxetine is indicated for the management of depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder.[L3358] One form of paroxetine, commercially known as Brisdelle, is used to manage mild to moderate vasomotor symptoms of menopause.[L7703] Off-label, paroxetine may be used for the treatment of premature ejaculation or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).[A1093,A181754,A181904]Paroxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) drug commonly known as Paxil. It has a variety of uses, including the treatment of anxiety disorders, major depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and symptoms of menopause, among others.[T653] It was approved by the FDA in the early 1990s and marketed by SmithKline Beecham.[L7712,L7715] A unique feature of this drug is that it is highly potent and selective in its inhibition of serotonin reuptake and has little effect on other neurotransmitters.[A31914] Because of its potent inhibition of serotonin reuptake, paroxetine is more likely to cause withdrawal effects upon cessation. Paroxetine is well tolerated in most patients with a similar adverse effect profile to other members of its drug class.[A31914] The controlled release formulation was designed to decrease the likelihood of nausea that is sometimes associated with paroxetine.[L7700,L7742]Paroxetine treats the symptoms of depression, various anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and the vasomotor symptoms of menopause via the inhibition of serotonin reuptake.[T653,L3358,L7703] The onset of action of paroxetine is reported to be approximately 6 weeks.[A181874]    Due its serotonergic activity, paroxetine, like other SSRI drugs, may potentiate serotonin syndrome. This risk is especially high when monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are given within 2 weeks of paroxetine administration. Upon cessation of MAO inhibitors, a 2-week interval before paroxetine administration is recommended. Do not coadminister these agents.[T656]Paroxetine enhances serotonergic activity via the inhibition presynaptic reuptake of serotonin by the serotonin (SERT) receptor.[A5492,A181772] This inhibition raises the level of serotonin in the synaptic cleft, relieving various symptoms. This drug has been demonstrated to be a stronger inhibitor of serotonin reuptake than other members of the same drug class, including [Citalopram], [Fluoxetine], and [Fluvoxamine].[A31914] The mechanism of action of paroxetine in relieving the vasomotor symptoms of menopause is unknown, according to the Brisdelle prescribing information[L7703], but may occur due to its effects on thermoregulation.[A181973]    Paroxetine shows a clinically insignificant affinity for adrenergic alpha-1 and alpha-2 receptors and β-adrenergic receptors, dopamine D1 and D2 receptors, histamine H1 receptors and serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors.[A31914] This drug shows some affinity for muscarinic cholinergic receptors and 5-H2B receptors.[A181829,A181847] The delayed onset of paroxetine therapeutic effects may be explained by the initial paroxetine actions on the 5-HT neurons.  In rats, paroxetine activates 5-HT1A receptors when it is first administered, inhibiting the stimulation of the  5-HT neurons and subsequent release of serotonin at the synaptic cleft.[A31914]"
443,"[L10304] When applied via transdermal patch, the combination of norethisterone and estradiol is indicated for the treatment of hypoestrogenism, vulvovaginal atrophy, and moderate-severe vasomotor symptoms.[L10310]Norethisterone, also known as norethindrone, is a synthetic progestational hormone belonging to the 19-nortestosterone-derived class of progestins.[A10367] It is further classified as a second-generation progestin, along with [levonorgestrel] and its derivatives, and is the active form of several other progestins including [norethynodrel] and [lynestrenol].L9527,L10301,L10304,L10307] First derived in 1951 in Mexico City, norethisterone was originally intended for use as a remedy for irregular menstruation and endometriosis, and was not marketed for use as an oral contraceptive until 1962.[L10439]Norethisterone is a synthetic oral progestin used for contraception or to treat other hormone-related conditions such as menopausal symptoms and endometriosis. As a synthetic progestin, norethisterone acts similarly to endogenous progesterone but with a much higher potency - it acts at the pelvic level to alter cervical and endometrial function, as well as via the inhibition of pituitary hormones that play a role in follicular maturation and ovulation.L9527]On a molecular level, progestins like norethisterone exert their effects on target cells via binding to progesterone receptors that result in downstream changes to target genes.[L10304] Target cells are found in the reproductive tract, breast, pituitary, hypothalamus, skeletal tissue, and central nervous system.[L10304] Contraceptive efficacy is derived mainly from changes to the cervical mucus, wherein norethisterone increases the cell content and viscosity of the mucous to impede sperm transport and migration.[L9527] Norethisterone also induces a variety of changes to the endometrium - including atrophy, irregular secretion, and suppressed proliferation - that make it inhospitable for implantation.[L9527,A37129] Working via a negative feedback loop, norethisterone also acts on both the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary to suppress the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary. Suppression of these hormones prevents follicular development, ovulation, and corpus luteum development.[A37129]     When used as a component of hormone replacement therapy in menopausal women, norethisterone’s value is mainly in suppressing the growth of the endometrium.[A188156] As estrogen stimulates endometrial growth, the unopposed use of estrogen in postmenopausal women with an intact uterus can lead to endometrial hyperplasia which can increase the risk of endometrial cancer. The addition of a progestin to a hormone replacement therapy in this population protects against this endometrial hyperplasia and, therefore, lowers the risk associated with the use of hormone replacement therapies.    Norethisterone, along with other progestins and endogenous progesterone, has a low affinity for other steroid receptors, such as the androgen receptor and glucocorticoid receptor.[A10367,A188075] While affinity and agonistic activity at these receptors is minimal, it is thought that androgen receptor agonism is responsible for some of the adverse effects observed with progestin use (e.g. acne, serum lipid changes).[A10367]"
444,"Used as a local anesthetic primarily in oral surgeryA local anesthetic of the ester type that has a slow onset and a short duration of action. It is mainly used for infiltration anesthesia, peripheral nerve block, and spinal block. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p1016). Procaine has also been investigated as an oral entry inhibitor in treatment-experienced HIV patients [L1215].Procaine is an anesthetic agent indicated for production of local or regional anesthesia, particularly for oral surgery. Procaine (like cocaine) has the advantage of constricting blood vessels which reduces bleeding, unlike other local anesthetics like lidocaine. Procaine is an ester anesthetic. It is metabolized in the plasma by the enzyme pseudocholinesterase through hydrolysis into para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), which is then excreted by the kidneys into the urine.Procaine acts mainly by inhibiting sodium influx through voltage gated sodium channels in the neuronal cell membrane of peripheral nerves. When the influx of sodium is interrupted, an action potential cannot arise and signal conduction is thus inhibited. The receptor site is thought to be located at the cytoplasmic (inner) portion of the sodium channel. Procaine has also been shown to bind or antagonize the function of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors as well as nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and the serotonin receptor-ion channel complex."

446,"Indicated for the treatment and management of hypotension.An alpha-adrenergic agonist that causes prolonged peripheral vasoconstriction. It has little if any direct effect on the central nervous system.Methoxamine is a potent sympathomimetic amine that increases both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Methoxamine is indicated for prevention and treatment of the acute hypotensive state occurring with spinal anesthesia. It is also indicated as adjunctive treatment of hypotension due to hemorrhage, reactions to medications, surgical complications, and shock associated with brain damage due to trauma or tumor. Methoxamine acts on both &alpha;1-adrenergic receptors but appears to have no effect on &beta;-adrenergic receptors. It acts by increasing the force of the heart's pumping action as well as constricting peripheral blood vessels.Methoxamine acts through peripheral vasoconstriction by acting as a pure alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonist, consequently increasing systemic blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic)."
447,"Homatropine methylbromide is a quaternary ammonium muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist belonging to the group of medicines called anti-muscarinics. Homatropine is used to treat duodenal or stomach ulcers or intestine problems.  It may also be used to prevent nausea, vomiting, and motion sickness.Homatropine methylbromide belongs to the group of medicines called anti-muscarinics. Homatropine is used to treat duodenal or stomach ulcers or intestine problems. It can be used together with antacids or other medicine in the treatment of peptic ulcer. It may also be used to prevent nausea, vomiting, and motion sickness.Homatropine is a quaternary ammonium muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. The muscarinic acetylcholine receptor mediates various cellular responses, including inhibition of adenylate cyclase, breakdown of phosphoinositides and modulation of potassium channels through the action of G proteins. Homatropine methylbromide inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves as well as on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. These postganglionic receptor sites are present in the autonomic effector cells of the smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, and exocrine glands. Depending on the dose, anticholinergics may reduce the motility and secretory activity of the gastrointestinal system, and the tone of the ureter and urinary bladder and may have a slight relaxant action on the bile ducts and gallbladder."
448,"For the treatment of depression and depression accompanied by anxiety, agitation or sleep disturbanceTricyclic antidepressant similar to imipramine, but with more antihistaminic and sedative properties.Trimipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant. It was thought that tricyclic antidepressants work by inhibiting the re-uptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin by nerve cells. However, this response occurs immediately, yet mood does not lift for around two weeks. It is now thought that changes occur in receptor sensitivity in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The hippocampus is part of the limbic system, a part of the brain involved in emotions. Presynaptic receptors are affected: a1 and b1 receptors are sensitized, a2 receptors are desensitised (leading to increased noradrenaline production). Tricyclics are also known as effective analgesics for different types of pain, especially neuropathic or neuralgic pain. A precise mechanism for their analgesic action is unknown, but it is thought that they modulate anti-pain opioid systems in the CNS via an indirect serotonergic route. They are also effective in migraine prophylaxis, but not in abortion of acute migraine attack. The mechanism of their anti-migraine action is also thought to be serotonergic.Trimipramine's mechanism of action differs from other tricyclic antidepressants. Trimipramine acts by decreasing the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin (5-HT)."
449,"Sublingual nitroglycerin is indicated for the acute relief of an attack or acute prophylaxis of angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease.[L7102,L38369,L42320] Transdermal nitroglycerin is indicated for the prevention of angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease.[L7141]    Intravenous nitroglycerin is indicated for the treatment of peri-operative hypertension; for control of congestive heart failure in the setting of acute myocardial infarction; for treatment of angina pectoris in patients who have not responded to sublingual nitroglycerin and beta (β)-blockers; and for induction of intraoperative hypotension.[L7099]     Topical nitroglycerin ointment is used to treat moderate to severe pain associated with chronic anal fissure.[L42445]Nitroglycerin, also known as glyceryl trinitrate,[A180169] is an organic nitrate and a vasodilating agent [L38369] that was first discovered in 1847.[A249965] Originally used to dynamite, its antianginal effects were identified in the late 1860s after it produced headaches in factory workers while workers with angina pectoris or heart failure experienced relief from chest pain.[A180166,A180172] Its use as a treatment for angina dates back to 1879 and is still used to treat and prevent angina.[A249970] Nitroglycerin causes vasodilation in both arteries and veins.[A180172]    Nitroglycerin is used in a variety of different conditions, including angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease,[L7102,L7141,L38369,L42320] peri-operative hypertension, congestive heart failure,[L7099] and chronic anal fissure.[L42445] It is also used to induce intraoperative hypotension.[L7099]Nitroglycerin causes the relaxation of vascular smooth muscles, causing arteriolar and venous dilatation.[L38369] It increases blood flow to the myocardium and reduces cardiac preload and afterload, decreasing myocardial wall stress and ameliorating anginal symptoms.[A180172,A249970,L7102] Nitroglycerin also reduces coronary artery spasm, decreasing systemic vascular resistance as well as systolic and diastolic blood pressure.[L38369]    Like other organic nitrates, repeated and prolonged administration of nitroglycerin can lead to the development of tolerance or desensitization of vascular smooth muscle to further nitroglycerin-induced vasorelaxation. This loss of efficacy may be associated with the inhibition of mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase, which is an important enzyme involved in the bioactivation of nitroglycerin.[A180166,A180169,A180172] Nitroglycerin tolerance may be accompanied by pro-oxidant effects, endothelial dysfunction, and increased sensitivity to vasoconstrictors.[A180172]Nitroglycerin is converted by mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase in smooth muscle cells to nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator. NO activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which converts guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) in vascular smooth muscle and other tissues.[A180166,A180169,A249970] cGMP is an endogenous vasodilator of vascular smooth muscle:[A180172] it causes protein kinase-dependent phosphorylation and activates downstream cascades that promote relaxation and increased blood flow in veins, arteries and cardiac tissue.[A180172,A249970] An _in vitro_ study using mouse aorta suggests that nitric oxide, an active metabolite of nitroglycerin, targets the natriuretic peptide receptors.[A5526] "
450,"For inpatients and outpatients as an adjunct to general anesthesia to facilitate both rapid sequence and routine tracheal intubation, and to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation.Rocuronium (rapid onset-curonium) is a desacetoxy analogue of vecuronium with a more rapid onset of action. It is an aminosteroid non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker or muscle relaxant used in modern anaesthesia, to facilitate endotracheal intubation and to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation. Introduced in 1994, rocuronium has rapid onset, and intermediate duration of action. It is commonly marketed under the trade names Zemuron and Esmeron. The drug is associated with the risk of developing allergic reactions in some high-risk patients, such as those with asthma. However, there was a similar incidence of allergic reactions associated with other non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents. [Sugammadex] is a γ-cyclodextrin derivative that has been introduced as a novel agent to reverse the action of rocuronium.Neuromuscular blocking agents are drugs that cause skeletal muscle relaxation primarily by causing a decreased response to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) at the myoneural (neuromuscular) junction of skeletal muscle. At that site, ACh normally produces electrical depolarization of the postjunctional membrane of motor end-plate, which leads to conduction of muscle action potential and subsequently induces skeletal muscle contraction. Neuromuscular agents are classified as depolarizing or nondepolarizing. Rocuronium is a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent with a rapid to intermediate onset depending on dose and intermediate duration. Rocuronium, like vecuronium is longer acting in infants than in children. However, unlike vecuronium, rocuronium retains the characteristics of an intermediate-acting NMBD in infants.Rocuronium acts by competing for cholinergic receptors at the motor end-plate. This action is antagonized by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as neostigmine and edrophonium. Rocuronium acts by competitively binding to nicotinic cholinergic receptors. The binding of vecuronium decreases the opportunity for acetylcholine to bind to the nicotinic receptor at the postjunctional membrane of the myoneural junction. As a result, depolarization is prevented, calcium ions are not released and muscle contraction does not occur. Evidence also suggests that nondepolarizing agents can affect ACh release. It has been hypothesized that nondepolarzing agents bind to postjunctional (""curare"") receptors and may therefore interfere with the sodium and potassium flux, which is responsible for depolarization and repolarization of the membranes involved in muscle contraction. "
451,"For the treatment of strongyloidiasis (threadworm), cutaneous larva migrans (creeping eruption), visceral larva migrans, and trichinosis.2-Substituted benzimidazole first introduced in 1962. It is active against a variety of nematodes and is the drug of choice for strongyloidiasis. It has CNS side effects and hepatototoxic potential. (From Smith and Reynard, Textbook of Pharmacology, 1992, p919)Thiabendazole is a fungicide and parasiticide. Thiabendazole is also a chelating agent, which means that it is used medicinally to bind metals in cases of metal poisoning, such as lead poisoning, mercury poisoning or antimony poisoning. Thiabendazole is vermicidal and/or vermifugal against Ascaris lumbricoides (""common roundworm""), Strongyloides stercoralis (threadworm), Necator americanus, Ancylostoma duodenale(hookworm), Trichuris trichiura (whipworm), Ancylostoma braziliense (dog and cat hookworm), Toxocara canis, Toxocara cati(ascarids), and Enterobius vermicularis(pinworm). Thiabendazole also suppresses egg and/or larval production and may inhibit the subsequent development of those eggs or larvae which are passed in the feces.The precise mode of action of thiabendazole on the parasite is unknown, but it most likely inhibits the helminth-specific enzyme fumarate reductase."
452,"For the treatment of non-insulin dependent-diabetes mellitus in conjunction with diet and exercise.Nateglinide is an oral antihyperglycemic agent used for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It belongs to the meglitinide class of short-acting insulin secretagogues, which act by binding to β cells of the pancreas to stimulate insulin release. Nateglinide is an amino acid derivative that induces an early insulin response to meals decreasing postprandial blood glucose levels. It should only be taken with meals and meal-time doses should be skipped with any skipped meal. Approximately one month of therapy is required before a decrease in fasting blood glucose is seen. Meglitnides may have a neutral effect on weight or cause a slight increase in weight. The average weight gain caused by meglitinides appears to be lower than that caused by sulfonylureas and insulin and appears to occur only in those naïve to oral antidiabetic agents. Due to their mechanism of action, meglitinides may cause hypoglycemia although the risk is thought to be lower than that of sulfonylureas since their action is dependent on the presence of glucose. In addition to reducing postprandial and fasting blood glucose, meglitnides have been shown to decrease glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, which are reflective of the last 8-10 weeks of glucose control. Meglitinides appear to be more effective at lowering postprandial blood glucose than metformin, sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones. Nateglinide is extensively metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine (83%) and feces (10%). The major metabolites possess less activity than the parent compound. One minor metabolite, the isoprene, has the same potency as its parent compound.Insulin secretion by pancreatic β cells is partly controlled by cellular membrane potential. Membrane potential is regulated through an inverse relationship between the activity of cell membrane ATP-sensitive potassium channels (ABCC8) and extracellular glucose concentrations. Extracellular glucose enters the cell via GLUT2 (SLC2A2) transporters. Once inside the cell, glucose is metabolized to produce ATP. High concentrations of ATP inhibit ATP-sensitive potassium channels causing membrane depolarization. When extracellular glucose concentrations are low, ATP-sensitive potassium channels open causing membrane repolarization. High glucose concentrations cause ATP-sensitive potassium channels to close resulting in membrane depolarization and opening of L-type calcium channels. The influx of calcium ions stimulates calcium-dependent exocytosis of insulin granules. Nateglinide increases insulin release by inhibiting ATP-sensitive potassium channels in a glucose-dependent manner. Nateglinide activity is dependent on the presence functioning β cells and glucose. In contrast to sulfonylurea insulin secretatogogues, nateglinide has no effect on insulin release in the absence of glucose. Rather, it potentiates the effect of extracellular glucose on ATP-sensitive potassium channel and has little effect on insulin levels between meals and overnight. As such, nateglinide is more effective at reducing postprandial blood glucose levels than fasting blood glucose levels and requires a longer duration of therapy (approximately one month) before decreases in fasting blood glucose are observed. The insulinotropic effects of nateglinide are highest at intermediate glucose levels (3 to 10 mmol/L) and it does not increase insulin release already stimulated by high glucose concentrations (greater than 15 mmol/L). Nateglinide appears to be selective for pancreatic β cells and does not appear to affect skeletal or cardiac muscle or thyroid tissue."
453,"For use, as an adjunct to general anesthesia, to facilitate endotracheal intubation and to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation.A non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent with short duration of action. Its lack of significant cardiovascular effects and its lack of dependence on good kidney function for elimination provide clinical advantage over alternate non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents.Atracurium is a nondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxant. Atracurium can be used most advantageously if muscle twitch response to peripheral nerve stimulation is monitored to assess degree of muscle relaxation. The duration of neuromuscular block produced by Atracurium is approximately one third to one half the duration of block by d-tubocurarine, metocurine, and pancuronium at initially equipotent doses. As with other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers, the time to onset of paralysis decreases and the duration of maximum effect increases with increasing doses of Atracurium. Repeated administration of maintenance doses of Atracurium has no cumulative effect on the duration of neuromuscular block if recovery is allowed to begin prior to repeat dosing. Moreover, the time needed to recover from repeat doses does not change with additional doses. Repeat doses can therefore be administered at relatively regular intervals with predictable results.Atracurium antagonizes the neurotransmitter action of acetylcholine by binding competitively with cholinergic receptor sites on the motor end-plate. This antagonism is inhibited, and neuromuscular block reversed, by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as neostigmine, edrophonium, and pyridostigmine."
454,"Risperidone is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia [L12885,L44692,L46297] and irritability associated with autistic disorder.[L12885,L44692]    Risperidone is additionally indicated in Canada for the short-term symptomatic management of aggression or psychotic symptoms in patients with severe dementia of the Alzheimer type unresponsive to nonpharmacological approaches.[L12906]    Risperidone is also used off-label for a number of conditions including as an adjunct to antidepressants in treatment-resistant depression.[A177226]Risperidone is a second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) medication used in the treatment of a number of mood and mental health conditions including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.[L12885] It is one of the most widely used SGAs. [Paliperidone], another commonly used SGA, is the primary active metabolite of risperidone (i.e. 9-hydroxyrisperidone).[L12885]    Schizophrenia and various mood disorders are thought to be caused by an excess of dopaminergic D2 and serotonergic 5-HT2A activity, resulting in overactivity of central mesolimbic pathways and mesocortical pathways, respectively. Risperidone is thought to reduce this overactivity through inhibition of dopaminergic D2 receptors and serotonergic 5-HT2A receptors in the brain.[L12885]    Risperidone binds with a very high affinity to 5-HT2A receptors, approximately 10-20 fold greater than the drug's binding affinity to D2 receptors, and carries lesser activity at several off-targets which may responsible for some of its undesirable effects.[L12885]The primary action of risperidone is to decrease dopaminergic and serotonergic pathway activity in the brain, therefore decreasing symptoms of schizophrenia and mood disorders.[A1115,A1116]    Risperidone has a high binding affinity for serotonergic 5-HT2A receptors when compared to dopaminergic D2 receptors in the brain.[A1114,A1115] Risperidone binds to D2 receptors with a lower affinity than first-generation antipsychotic drugs, which bind with very high affinity. A reduction in extrapyramidal symptoms with risperidone, when compared to its predecessors, is likely a result of its moderate affinity for dopaminergic D2 receptors.[A1119,A1117]Though its precise mechanism of action is not fully understood, current focus is on the ability of risperidone to inhibit the D2 dopaminergic receptors and 5-HT2A serotonergic receptors in the brain. Schizophrenia is thought to result from an excess of dopaminergic D2 and serotonergic 5-HT2A activity, resulting in overactivity of central mesolimbic pathways and mesocortical pathways, respectively.[A1115, A1116, A1117]    D2 dopaminergic receptors are transiently inhibited by risperidone, reducing dopaminergic neurotransmission, therefore decreasing positive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as delusions and hallucinations.[A251765] Risperidone binds transiently and with loose affinity to the dopaminergic D2 receptor, with an ideal receptor occupancy of 60-70% for optimal effect.[A1119,A31773] Rapid dissociation of risperidone from the D2 receptors contributes to decreased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), which occur with permanent and high occupancy blockade of D2 dopaminergic receptors.[A1118,A1119] Low-affinity binding and rapid dissociation from the D2 receptor distinguish risperidone from the traditional antipsychotic drugs. A higher occupancy rate of D2 receptors is said to increase the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms and is therefore to be avoided.[A1118,A1119,A31771]      Increased serotonergic mesocortical activity in schizophrenia results in negative symptoms, such as depression and decreased motivation. The high-affinity binding of risperidone to 5-HT2A receptors leads to a decrease in serotonergic activity. In addition, 5-HT2A receptor blockade results in decreased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms, likely by increasing dopamine release from the frontal cortex, and not the nigrostriatal tract. Dopamine level is therefore not completely inhibited.[A1117,A1119] Through the above mechanisms, both serotonergic and D2 blockade by risperidone are thought to synergistically work to decrease the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms.      Risperidone has also been said to be an antagonist of alpha-1 (α1), alpha-2 (α2), and histamine (H1) receptors.[A37034] Blockade of these receptors is thought to improve symptoms of schizophrenia, however the exact mechanism of action on these receptors is not fully understood at this time.[L12885]"
455,"Esomeprazole is indicated for the treatment of acid-reflux disorders including healing and maintenance of erosive esophagitis, and symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease, H. pylori eradication, prevention of gastrointestinal bleeds with NSAID use, and for the long-term treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions including Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome. Esomeprazole, sold under the brand name Nexium, is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) medication used for the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), for gastric protection to prevent recurrence of stomach ulcers or gastric damage from chronic use of NSAIDs, and for the treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions including Zollinger-Ellison (ZE) Syndrome. It can also be found in quadruple regimens for the treatment of _H. pylori_ infections along with other antibiotics including [DB01060], [DB01211], and [DB00916], for example.[A177271, F4498] Its efficacy is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including [DB00338], [DB00213], [DB00448], [DB05351], and [DB01129]. Esomeprazole is the s-isomer of [DB00338], which is a racemate of the S- and R-enantiomer. Esomeprazole has been shown to inhibit acid secretion to a similar extent as [DB00338], without any significant differences between the two compounds _in vitro_.     Esomeprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. As the binding of esomeprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, esomeprazole's duration of antisecretory effect persists longer than 24 hours.[FDA Label]    PPIs such as esomeprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]    Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as esomeprazole has been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients such as iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]    Rapid discontinuation of PPIs such as esomeprazole may cause a rebound effect and a short term increase in hypersecretion.[A177574] Esomeprazole doses should be slowly lowered, or tapered, before discontinuing to prevent this rebound effect.Esomeprazole is a compound that inhibits gastric acid secretion and is indicated in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), the healing of erosive esophagitis, and <i>H. pylori</i> eradication to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence. Esomeprazole belongs to a new class of antisecretory compounds, the substituted benzimidazoles, that do not exhibit anticholinergic or H2 histamine antagonistic properties, but that suppress gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. By doing so, it inhibits acid secretion into the gsatric lumen. This effect is dose-related and leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated acid secretion irrespective of the stimulus.    Esomeprazole is the s-isomer of [DB00338], which is a racemate of the S- and R-enantiomer. Esomeprazole has been shown to inhibit acid secretion to a similar extent as [DB00338], without any significant differences between the two compounds _in vitro_.     PPIs such as esomeprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]    Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as esomeprazole has been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]Esomeprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. As the binding of esomeprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, esomeprazole's duration of antisecretory effect that persists longer than 24 hours.[FDA Label]  "
456,"Indicated for the symptomatic treatment of nausea, vomiting, and dizziness associated with motion sickness,[L6772] and management of vertigo due to various causes, including radiation sickness, Meniere’s syndrome, labyrinthitis and other vestibular disturbances.[L6766]Meclizine is a histamine H1 antagonist with antiemetic and antivertigo properties. It is used in the symptomatic treatment of motion sickness and control of vertigo associated with vestibular system diseases. It also exhibits anticholinergic, central nervous system depressant, and local anesthetic effects.[L6760] Commonly marketed under the brand name Antivert in the U.S., meclizine is available as oral tablets.Meclizine works on the higher centres of the brain to reduce nausea, vomiting, or vertigo. It is effective against nausea and vomiting arising from many causes, including motion sickness and disorders affecting the vestibular system. The onset of action of meclizine is about 1 hour, with effects lasting between 8 to 24 hours.[L6760] Meclizine is reported to cause drowsiness due to its anticholinergic actions.[L6766] Vomiting is a centrally regulated reflex mechanism that initiates from the vomiting center and the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) located in the medulla. Motion sickness is also regulated by CTZ. The blood-brain barrier near the CTZ is relatively permeable to circulating mediators and CTZ can transmit impulses to vomiting center located in the brainstem. Different receptors responding to different factors, including histamine, 5-HT, enkephalins, substance P, and dopamine, are expressed along the brainstem to activate respective pathways and contribute to the control of vomiting. Histamine H1 receptors are expressed on the vestibular nuclei and nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) that are activated by motion sickness and stimuli from the pharynx and stomach. When activated, H1 receptor signaling from these nuclei is transmitted to the CTZ and vomiting centre.[T28]     Through its antagonistic action on the H1 receptors, meclizine primarily works by inhibiting signaling pathway transduction through histaminergic neurotransmission from the vestibular nuclei and NTS to the CTZ and medullary vomiting center.[A179581] Meclizine may also decrease the labyrinth excitability and vestibular stimulation.[L6760]"

Hetacillin is prepared by reacting ampicillin with acetone. Ampicillin rapidly decomposes because of the intramolecular attack of the side chain amino group on the lactam ring. _In vitro_ studies have shown that hetacillin is resistant to beta lactamase activity.[A216921] However, this effect is transient, as the hydrolysis product, ampicillin, is readily inactivated by beta lactamase.[A216921] Hetacillin locks up the offending amino group and prevents the decomposition of Hetacillin. Once hydrolyzed to ampicillin (and acetone), ampicillin binds to the penicillin binding proteins found in susceptible bacteria. This inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins."
458,"For the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's Disease)A glutamate antagonist (receptors, glutamate) used as an anticonvulsant (anticonvulsants) and to prolong the survival of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Riluzole is marketed as Rilutek by Sanofi.Riluzole, a member of the benzothiazole class, is indicated for the treatment of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Riluzole extends survival and/or time to tracheostomy. It is also neuroprotective in various in vivo experimental models of neuronal injury involving excitotoxic mechanisms. The etiology and pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are not known, although a number of hypotheses have been advanced. One hypothesis is that motor neurons, made vulnerable through either genetic predisposition or environmental factors, are injured by glutamate. In some cases of familial ALS the enzyme superoxide dismutase has been found to be defective.The mode of action of riluzole is unknown. Its pharmacological properties include the following, some of which may be related to its effect: 1) an inhibitory effect on glutamate release (activation of glutamate reuptake), 2) inactivation of voltage-dependent sodium channels, and 3) ability to interfere with intracellular events that follow transmitter binding at excitatory amino acid receptors."

460,"Used for the promotion of diuresis before irreversible renal failure becomes established, the reduction of intracranial pressure, the treatment of cerebral edema, and the promotion of urinary excretion of toxic substances.    Mannitol is also indicated as add-on maintenance therapy for improving pulmonary function in cystic fibrosis patients aged 18 and over who have passed the BRONCHITOL tolerance test (BTT). It is recommended that patients take an orally inhaled short-acting bronchodilator 5-15 minutes prior to every inhaled mannitol dose.[L20024]Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that is metabolically inert in humans and occurs naturally, as a sugar or sugar alcohol, in fruits and vegetables. Mannitol elevates blood plasma osmolality, resulting in enhanced flow of water from tissues, including the brain and cerebrospinal fluid, into interstitial fluid and plasma. As a result, cerebral edema, elevated intracranial pressure, and cerebrospinal fluid volume and pressure may be reduced. Mannitol may also be used for the promotion of diuresis before irreversible renal failure becomes established; the promotion of urinary excretion of toxic substances; as an Antiglaucoma agent; and as a renal function diagnostic aid.    On October 30, 2020, mannitol was approved by the FDA as add-on maintenance therapy for the control of pulmonary symptoms associated with cystic fibrosis in adult patients and is currently marketed for this indication under the name BRONCHITOL® by Chiesi USA Inc.[L20024]Chemically, mannitol is an alcohol and a sugar, or a polyol; it is similar to xylitol or sorbitol. However, mannitol has a tendency to lose a hydrogen ion in aqueous solutions, which causes the solution to become acidic. For this reason, it is not uncommon to add a substance to adjust its pH, such as sodium bicarbonate. Mannitol is commonly used to increase urine production (diuretic). It is also used to treat or prevent medical conditions that are caused by an increase in body fluids/water (e.g., cerebral edema, glaucoma, kidney failure). Mannitol is frequently given along with other diuretics (e.g., furosemide, chlorothiazide) and/or IV fluid replacement.    Inhaled mannitol has the possibility to cause bronchospasm and hemoptysis; the occurrence of either should lead to discontinuation of inhaled mannitol.[L20024]Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that is metabolically inert in humans and occurs naturally, as a sugar or sugar alcohol, in fruits and vegetables. Mannitol elevates blood plasma osmolality, resulting in enhanced flow of water from tissues, including the brain and cerebrospinal fluid, into interstitial fluid and plasma. As a result, cerebral edema, elevated intracranial pressure, and cerebrospinal fluid volume and pressure may be reduced. As a diurectic mannitol induces diuresis because it is not reabsorbed in the renal tubule, thereby increasing the osmolality of the glomerular filtrate, facilitating excretion of water, and inhibiting the renal tubular reabsorption of sodium, chloride, and other solutes. Mannitol promotes the urinary excretion of toxic materials and protects against nephrotoxicity by preventing the concentration of toxic substances in the tubular fluid. As an Antiglaucoma agent mannitol levates blood plasma osmolarity, resulting in enhanced flow of water from the eye into plasma and a consequent reduction in intraocular pressure. As a renal function diagnostic aid mannitol is freely filtered by the glomeruli with less than 10% tubular reabsorption. Therefore, its urinary excretion rate may serve as a measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR).    The exact mechanism of action of inhaled mannitol in the symptomatic maintenance treatment of cystic fibrosis remains unclear.[A223199, L20024] It is hypothesized that mannitol produces an osmotic gradient across the airway epithelium that draws fluid into the extracellular space and alters the properties of the airway surface mucus layer, allowing easier mucociliary clearance.[A223199]"

Modafinil activates glutamatergic circuits while inhibiting GABA. Modafinil is thought to have less potential for abuse than other stimulants due to the absence of any significant euphoric or pleasurable effects. It is possible that modafinil acts by a synergistic combination of mechanisms including direct inhibition of dopamine reuptake, indirect inhibition of noradrenalin reuptake in the VLPO and orexin activation. Modafinil has partial alpha 1B-adrenergic agonist effects by directly stimulating the receptors."
462,"Used to treat acute iron or aluminum toxicity (an excess of aluminum in the body) in certain patients. Also used in certain patients with anemia who must receive many blood transfusions.Natural product isolated from Streptomyces pilosus. It forms iron complexes and is used as a chelating agent, particularly in the mesylate form.Deferoxamine, otherwise known as desferrioxamine or desferal, is a chelating agent used to remove excess iron or aluminum from the body. It acts by binding free iron or aluminum in the bloodstream and enhancing its elimination in the urine. By removing excess iron or aluminum, the agent reduces the damage done to various organs and tissues, such as the liver.Deferoxamine works in treating iron toxicity by binding trivalent (ferric) iron (for which it has a strong affinity), forming ferrioxamine, a stable complex which is eliminated via the kidneys. 100 mg of deferoxamine is capable of binding approximately 8.5 mg of trivalent (ferric) iron. Deferoxamine works in treating aluminum toxicity by binding to tissue-bound aluminum to form aluminoxamine, a stable, water-soluble complex. The formation of aluminoxamine increases blood concentrations of aluminum, resulting in an increased concentration gradient between the blood and dialysate, boosting the removal of aluminum during dialysis. 100 mg of deferoxamine is capable of binding approximately 4.1 mg of aluminum."
463,"Scopolamine is indicated in adult patients for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with motion sickness and for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) associated with anesthesia or opiate analgesia.[L31578]Scopolamine is a tropane alkaloid isolated from members of the _Solanaceae_ family of plants, similar to [atropine] and [hyoscyamine], all of which structurally mimic the natural neurotransmitter [acetylcholine].[A228423, A228763] Scopolamine was first synthesized in 1959, but to date, synthesis remains less efficient than extracting scopolamine from plants.[A228763] As an acetylcholine analogue, scopolamine can antagonize muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) in the central nervous system and throughout the body, inducing several therapeutic and adverse effects related to alteration of parasympathetic nervous system and cholinergic signalling.[A228758, L31578] Due to its dose-dependent adverse effects, scopolamine was the first drug to be offered commercially as a transdermal delivery system, Scopoderm TTS®, in 1981.[A228423, A228758] As a result of its anticholinergic effects, scopolamine is being investigated for diverse therapeutic applications; currently, it is approved for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with motion sickness and surgical procedures.[A228773, L31578]    Scopolamine was first approved by the FDA on December 31, 1979, and is currently available as both oral tablets and a transdermal delivery system.[L31578]Scopolamine is an anticholinergic belladonna alkaloid that, through competitive inhibition of muscarinic receptors, affects parasympathetic nervous system function and acts on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. Formulated as a patch, scopolamine is released continuously over three days and remains detectable in urine over a period of 108 hours. Scopolamine is contraindicated in angle-closure glaucoma and should be used with caution in patients with open-angle glaucoma due to scopolamine's ability to increase intraocular pressure. Also, scopolamine exhibits several neuropsychiatric effects: exacerbated psychosis, seizures, seizure-like, and other psychiatric reactions, and cognitive impairment; scopolamine may impair the ability of patients to operate machinery or motor vehicles, play underwater sports, or perform any other potentially hazardous activity. Women with severe preeclampsia should avoid scopolamine. Patients with gastrointestinal or urinary disorders should be monitored frequently for impairments, and scopolamine should be discontinued if these develop. Scopolamine can cause blurred vision if applied directly to the eye, and the transdermal patch should be removed before an MRI procedure to avoid skin burns. Due to its gastrointestinal effects, scopolamine can interfere with gastric secretion testing and should be discontinued at least 10 days before performing the test. Finally, scopolamine may induce dependence and resulting withdrawal symptoms, such as nausea, dizziness, vomiting, gastrointestinal disturbances, sweating, headaches, bradycardia, hypotension, and various neuropsychiatric manifestations following treatment discontinuation; severe symptoms may require medical attention.[L31578][Acetylcholine] (ACh) is a neurotransmitter that can signal through ligand-gated cation channels (nicotinic receptors) and G-protein-coupled muscarinic receptors (mAChRs). ACh signalling via mAChRs located in the central nervous system (CNS) and periphery can regulate smooth muscle contraction, glandular secretions, heart rate, and various neurological phenomena such as learning and memory.[A228738, A228743] mAChRs can be divided into five subtypes, M1-M5, expressed at various levels throughout the brain.[A228743] Also, M2 receptors are found in the heart and M3 receptors in smooth muscles, mediating effects apart from the direct modulation of the parasympathetic nervous system.[A228423] While M1, M3, and M5 mAChRs primarily couple to Gqproteins to activate phospholipase C, M2 and M4 mainly couple to Gi/o proteins to inhibit adenylyl cyclase and modulate cellular ion flow.[A228743] This system, in part, helps to control physiological responses such as nausea and vomiting.[L31578]    Scopolamine acts as a non-selective competitive inhibitor o1-M5 mAChRs, albeit with weaker M5 inhibition; as such, scopolamine is an anticholinergic with various dose-dependent therapeutic and adverse effects.[A228423, A228758, A228763] The exact mechanism(s) of action of scopolamine remains poorly understood. Recent evidence suggests that M1 (and possibly M2) mAChR antagonism at interneurons acts through inhibition of downstream neurotransmitter release and subsequent pyramidal neuron activation to mediate neurological responses associated with stress and depression.[A228773] Similar antagonism of M4 and M5 receptors is associated with potential therapeutic benefits in neurological conditions such as schizophrenia and substance abuse disorders.[A228743] The significance of these observations to scopolamine's current therapeutic indications of preventing nausea and vomiting is unclear but is linked to its anticholinergic effect and ability to alter signalling through the CNS associated with vomiting.[A228758, L31578]"
464,"For acute and long-term management of signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as for the management of pain.Etodolac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties. Its therapeutic effects are due to its ability to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. It is indicated for relief of signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.Etodolac is an anti-inflammatory agent with analgesic and antipyretic properties. It is used to treat osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and control acute pain. The therapeutic effects of etodolac are achieved via inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandins involved in fever, pain, swelling and inflammation. Etodolac is administered as a racemate. As with other NSAIDs, the S-form has been shown to be active while the R-form is inactive. Both enantiomers are stable and there is no evidence of R- to S- conversion _in vivo_.Similar to other NSAIDs, the anti-inflammatory effects of etodolac result from inhibition of the enzyme cycooxygenase (COX). This decreases the synthesis of peripheral prostaglandins involved in mediating inflammation. Etodolac binds to the upper portion of the COX enzyme active site and prevents its substrate, arachidonic acid, from entering the active site. Etodolac was previously thought to be a non-selective COX inhibitor, but it is now known to be 5 – 50 times more selective for COX-2 than COX-1. Antipyresis may occur by central action on the hypothalamus, resulting in peripheral dilation, increased cutaneous blood flow, and subsequent heat loss."
465,"Used as a local anaesthetic and is often used in dentistry.A local anesthetic that is similar pharmacologically to lidocaine. Currently, it is used most often for infiltration anesthesia in dentistry. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1992, p165)Prilocaine binds to the intracellular surface of sodium channels which blocks the subsequent influx of sodium into the cell. Action potential propagation and never function is, therefore, prevented. This block is reversible and when the drug diffuses away from the cell, sodium channel function is restored and nerve propagation returns.Prilocaine acts on sodium channels on the neuronal cell membrane, limiting the spread of seizure activity and reducing seizure propagation. The antiarrhythmic actions are mediated through effects on sodium channels in Purkinje fibers."

Epinastine is a topically active, direct H1-receptor antagonist and an inhibitor of the release of histamine from the mast cell. Epinastine is selective for the histamine H1-receptor and has affinity for the histamine H2 receptor. Epinastine also possesses affinity for the a1-, a2-, and 5-HT2 -receptors. Epinastine does not penetrate the blood/brain barrier and, therefore, is not expected to induce side effects of the central nervous system.Epinastine has a multiaction effect that inhibits the allergic response in 3 ways: 1. stabilizes mast cells by preventing mast cell degranulation to control the allergic response, 2. prevents histamine binding to both the H1- and H2-receptors to stop itching and provide lasting protection, and 3. prevents the release of proinflammatory chemical mediators from the blood vessel to halt progression of the allergic response."
467,"For the treatment of major depressive episode without melancholia.A propylamine formed from the cyclization of the side chain of amphetamine. This monoamine oxidase inhibitor is effective in the treatment of major depression, dysthymic disorder, and atypical depression. It also is useful in panic and phobic disorders (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1994, p311).     Tranylcypromine is a racemate comprising equal amounts of (1R,2S)- and (1S,2R)-2-phenylcyclopropan-1-amine with the chiral centers both located on the cylopropane ring. An irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor that is used as an antidepressant (INN tranylcypromine).Tranylcypromine belongs to a class of antidepressants called monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Tranylcypromine is a non-hydrazine monoamine oxidase inhibitor with a rapid onset of activity. MAO is an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative deamination of a number of amines, including serotonin, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine. Two isoforms of MAO, A and B, are found in the body. MAO-A is mainly found within cells located in the periphery and catalyzes the breakdown of serotonin, norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine and tyramine. MAO-B acts on phenylethylamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine and tyramine, is localized extracellularly and is found predominantly in the brain. While the mechanism of MAOIs is still unclear, it is thought that they act by increasing free serotonin and norepinephrine concentrations and/or by altering the concentrations of other amines in the CNS. It has been postulated that depression is caused by low levels of serotonin and/or norepinephrine and that increasing serotonergic and norepinephrinergic neurotransmission results in relief of depressive symptoms. MAO A inhibition is thought to be more relevant to antidepressant activity than MAO B inhibition. Selective MAO B inhibitors, such as selegiline, have no antidepressant effects.Tranylcypromine irreversibly and nonselectively inhibits monoamine oxidase (MAO). Within neurons, MAO appears to regulate the levels of monoamines released upon synaptic firing. Since depression is associated with low levels of monoamines, the inhibition of MAO serves to ease depressive symptoms, as this results in an increase in the concentrations of these amines within the CNS."

470,"Oral tretinoin is indicated for induction of remission in adults and pediatric patients one year of age and older with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), characterized by the presence of t(15;17) translocation or presence of PML/RARα gene expression and who are refractory to or who have relapsed from anthracycline chemotherapy or for whom anthracycline-based chemotherapy is contraindicated.Tretinoin, also known as all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), is a naturally occurring derivative of [vitamin A] (retinol).[A257474] It is an oxidation product in the physiological pathway of vitamin A metabolism.[A257689] In human circulation, tretinoin is normally found at very low concentrations, approximately 4 to 14 nmol/L.[A257689] Tretinoin exhibits anti-inflammatory, antineoplastic, antioxidant, and free radical-scavenging activities.[A257689] It has been used in dermatology for many years to treat various skin conditions ranging from acne to wrinkles [A257474,A258185] and activates nuclear receptors to regulate epithelial cell growth and differentiation.[A257474,A257629,A257609] Tretinoin is given orally to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia [L45349] and topically to treat skin conditions such as acne.[L45389,L34869,L45384]Tretinoin is a vitamin A derivative that promotes cell production, proliferation, and differentiation. When used topically, tretinoin regulates epidermal cell turnover and collagen production. It also prevents collagen loss, reduces inflammation, and blocks the induction of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), which are enzymes that disrupt collagen and elastic fibres.[A257474,A257629,A257609,A258180] In short-term and long-term studies, topical application of tretinoin at doses ranging from 0.001% to 0.1% was associated with improvements in clinical signs of photoaging and fine wrinkles, increased epidermal thickness, compaction of the stratum corneum, and decreased melanin content.[A257684,A258180,A258185,A257699] It also improved melanocyte differentiation and distribution, promotion of epidermal hyperplasia, and angiogenesis.[A257699]    Tretinoin exhibits antineoplastic activities when given orally.[L45349] Tretinoin was shown to induce differentiation in tumour cells.[A257694] It induced cytodifferentiation and decreased acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cell proliferation in culture and _in vivo_. In patients with APL, tretinoin promoted the initial maturation of the primitive promyelocytes derived from the leukemic clone, followed by a repopulation of the bone marrow and peripheral blood by normal, polyclonal hematopoietic cells in patients achieving complete remission.[L45349]The exact mechanism of action of tretinoin in skin conditions and acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) has not been fully elucidated; however, several proposed mechanisms exist. Tretinoin is believed to exert its pharmacological actions by binding to and activating two types of nuclear receptors - retinoic acid receptors (RARs) alpha, beta, and gamma and retinoid X receptors (RXRs). In the human skin, RARs (especially RAR-alpha) form heterodimers with RXR to act as inducible transcription regulators of genes involved in cell differentiation by binding to retinoic acid response elements.[A257724,A258185] Tretinoin binds to RXRs to promote epidermal proliferation. It also blocks the actions of inflammatory mediators, enhancing procollagen production and collagen type I and III formations.[A257474,A257629,A257609,A257699] Some animal and human studies suggest that tretinoin induces the expression of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), which stimulates the transcription of several types of collagen messenger RNA. Collagen formation curtails further solar UV-induced skin damage and aging processes.[A257699]    Acne is associated with abnormal follicular formation from excessive keratinization of epithelial cells. Tretinoin promotes cornified cell detachment and enhances keratinocyte shedding. It also stimulates mitotic activity and loosely-adherent corneocyte turnover to expel comedo contents, reducing microcomedo precursor lesions of acne vulgaris.[A257474,L34869] Tretinoin may reduce epidermal melanin and pigmentation by increasing keratinocyte turnover and reducing tyrosinase activity.[A257609,A258180]    RAR-alpha and -beta have also been implicated in APL.[A257724] APL is characterized by a t(15;17) chromosomal translocation, which fuses the promyelocytic myeloid leukemia (PML) gene with the RAR-alpha gene.[A257689,A257694] The resulting PML-RAR-alpha fusion protein plays a role in the pathogenesis of APL by aberrating promyelocyte differentiation. The PML-RAR-alpha fusion protein is found to be predominant in leukemic cells, exerting a dominant negative effect on RAR, RXR and PML function.[A257689] Tretinoin induces terminal differentiation in hemopoietic precursor cell lines and APL cells.[A257694] Tretinoin is believed to promote caspase-mediated cleavage and proteasome-dependent degradation to cause apoptosis and degradation of the PML-RAR-alpha fusion protein.[A257474] It may also convert the fusion protein from a transcription repressor to an activator.[A257474]"

May be used to treat infections caused by Chlamydiae spp., B. burgdorferi (Lyme disease), and upper respiratory infections caused by typical (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis) and atypical organisms (C. pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae, L. pneumophila). May also be used to treat acne. Tetracycline may be an alternative drug for people who are allergic to penicillin.Tetracycline is a broad spectrum polyketide antibiotic produced by the Streptomyces genus of Actinobacteria. It exerts a bacteriostatic effect on bacteria by binding reversible to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit and blocking incoming aminoacyl tRNA from binding to the ribosome acceptor site. It also binds to some extent to the bacterial 50S ribosomal subunit and may alter the cytoplasmic membrane causing intracellular components to leak from bacterial cells.    The FDA withdrew its approval for the use of all liquid oral drug products formulated for pediatric use containing tetracycline in a concentration greater than 25 mg/ml.[L43942] Other formulations of tetracycline continue to be used.Tetracycline is a short-acting antibiotic that  inhibits bacterial growth by inhibiting translation. It binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit and prevents the amino-acyl tRNA from binding to the A site of the ribosome. It also binds to some extent to the 50S ribosomal subunit. This binding is reversible in nature. Additionally tetracycline may alter the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria causing leakage of intracellular contents, such as nucleotides, from the cell. Tetracycline passively diffuses through porin channels in the bacterial membrane and reversibly binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit, preventing binding of tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex, and thus interfering with protein synthesis."

474,"For use as an electrolyte replenisher and in the treatment of hypokalemia.A white crystal or crystalline powder used as an electrolyte replenisher, in the treatment of hypokalemia, in buffer solutions, and in fertilizers and explosives.    The FDA withdrew its approval for the use of all solid oral dosage form drug products containing potassium chloride that supply 100 mg or more of potassium per dosage unit, except for controlled-release dosage forms and those products formulated for preparation of solution prior to ingestion.[L43942]The potassium ion is in the principle intracellular cation of most body tissues. Potassium ions participate in a number of essential physiological processes including the maintenance of intracellular tonicity, the transmission of nerve impulses, the contraction of cardiac, skeletal and smooth muscle, and the maintenance of normal renal function. The intracellular concentration of potassium is approximately 150 to 160 mEq per liter. The normal adult plasma concentration is 3.5 to 5 mEq per liter. An active ion transport system maintains this gradient across the plasma membrane. Potassium is a normal dietary constituent and under steady-state conditions the amount of potassium absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract is equal to the amount excreted in the urine. The usual dietary intake of potassium is 50 to 100 mEq per day. Potassium depletion will occur whenever the rate of potassium loss through renal excretion and/or loss from the gastrointestinal tract exceeds the rate of potassium intake. Such depletion usually develops as a consequence of therapy with diuretics, primarily or secondary hyperaldosteronism, diabetic ketoacidosis, or inadequate replacement of potassium in patients on prolonged parenteral nutrition. Depletion can develop rapidly with severe diarrhea, especially if associated with vomiting. Potassium depletion due to these causes is usually accompanied by concomitant loss of chloride and is manifested by hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Potassium depletion may produce weakness, fatigue, disturbances of cardiac rhythm (primarily ectopic beats), prominent U-waves in the electrocardiogram, and, in advanced cases, flaccid paralysis and/or impaired ability to concentrate urine. If potassium depletion associated with metabolic alkalosis cannot be managed by correcting the fundamental cause of the deficiency, e.g., where the patient requires long-term diuretic therapy, supplemental potassium in the form of high potassium food or potassium chloride may be able to restore normal potassium levels. In rare circumstances (e.g., patients with renal tubular acidosis) potassium depletion may be associated with metabolic acidosis and hyperchloremia. In such patients, potassium replacement should be accomplished with potassium salts other than the chloride, such as potassium bicarbonate, potassium citrate, potassium acetate, or potassium gluconate.Supplemental potassium in the form of high potassium food or potassium chloride may be able to restore normal potassium levels."
475,"For the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (first-line therapy when administered with 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin). Irinotecan is currently under investigation for the treatment of metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer. Irinotecan is an antineoplastic enzyme inhibitor primarily used in the treatment of colorectal cancer. It is a derivative of camptothecin that inhibits the action of topoisomerase I. Irinotecan prevents religation of the DNA strand by binding to topoisomerase I-DNA complex, and causes double-strand DNA breakage and cell death. It is a derivative of camptothecin. Irinotecan was approved for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer in October, 2015 (irinotecan liposome injection, trade name Onivyde).Irinotecan is an antineoplastic enzyme inhibitor primarily used in the treatment of colorectal cancer. Irinotecan is a semisynthetic derivative of camptothecin. Camptothecins interact specifically with topoisomerase I, an enzyme in the cell nucleus that regulates DNA topology and facilitates nuclear processes such as DNA replication, recombination, and repair. During these processes, topoisomerase I relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single-strand breaks, allowing single DNA strands to pass through the break. The 3'-DNA terminus of the broken DNA strands bind covalently with the topoisomerase enzyme to form a catalytic intermediate called a cleavable complex. After the DNA is sufficiently relaxed and the strand passage reaction is complete, DNA topoisomerase reattaches the broken DNA strands to form the chemically unaltered topoisomers that allow transcription to proceed. Irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38 bind to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevent religation of these single-strand breaks. Current research suggests that the cytotoxicity of irinotecan is due to double-strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topoisomerase I, DNA, and either Irinotecan or SN-38. Mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair these double-strand breaks. The precise contribution of SN-38 to the activity of irinotecan in humans is not known. Irinotecan is cell cycle phase-specific (S-phase).Irinotecan inhibits the action of topoisomerase I. Irinotecan prevents religation of the DNA strand by binding to topoisomerase I-DNA complex. The formation of this ternary complex interferes with the moving replication fork, which induces replication arrest and lethal double-stranded breaks in DNA. As a result, DNA damage is not efficiently repaired and apoptosis (programmed cell death) occurs."
476,"In the United States, methimazole is indicated for the treatment of hyperthyroidism in patients with Graves' disease or toxic multinodular goiter for whom thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine therapy are not appropriate treatment options. Methimazole is also indicated for the amelioration of hyperthyroid symptoms in preparation for thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine therapy.[L8336]    In Canada, methimazole carries the above indications and is also indicated for the medical treatment of hyperthyroidism regardless of other available treatment options.[L8339]Methimazole is a thionamide antithyroid agent that inhibits the synthesis of thyroid hormones.[A184559,A184733,A184694] It was first introduced as an antithyroid agent in 1949[A184502] and is now commonly used in the management of hyperthyroidism, particularly in those for whom more aggressive options such as surgery or radioactive iodine therapy are inappropriate.[L8336,L8339]    On a weight basis, methimazole is 10 times more potent than the other major antithyroid thionamide used in North America, [propylthiouracil],[L8339] and is the active metabolite of the pro-drug [carbimazole], which is an antithyroid medication used in the United Kingdom and parts of the former British Commonwealth.[A184733] Traditionally, methimazole has been preferentially used over propylthiouracil due to the risk of fulminant hepatotoxicity carried by the latter,[A184757] with propylthiouracil being preferred in pregnancy due to a perceived lower risk of teratogenic effects. Despite documented teratogenic effects in its published labels,[L8336,L8339] the true teratogenicity of methimazole appears to be unclear[A184643,A184757,A184763] and its place in therapy may change in the future.Methimazole inhibits the synthesis of thyroid hormones resulting in an alleviation of hyperthyroidism.[L8336][L8339] Onset of action occurs within 12 to 18 hours, and its duration of action is 36 to 72 hours, likely due to concentration of methimazole and some metabolites within the thyroid gland after administration.[A184643]    The most serious potential side effect of methimazole therapy is agranulocytosis, and patients should be instructed to monitor for, and report, any signs or symptoms of agranulocytosis such as fever or sore throat. Other cytopenias may also occur during methimazole therapy. There also exists the potential for severe hepatic toxicity with the use of methimazole, and monitoring for signs and symptoms of hepatic dysfunction, such as jaundice, anorexia, pruritus, and elevation in liver transaminases, is prudent in patients using this therapy.[L8336,L8339]Methimazole's primary mechanism of action appears to be interference in an early step in thyroid hormone synthesis involving thyroid peroxidase (TPO), however the exact method through which methimazole inhibits this step is unclear.[A184559]  TPO, along with hydrogen peroxide, normally catalyzes the conversion of iodide to iodine and then further catalyzes the incorporation of this iodine onto the 3 and/or 5 positions of the phenol rings of tyrosine residues in thyroglobulin. These thyroglobulin molecules then degrade within thyroid follicular cells to form either thyroxine (T4) or tri-iodothyronine (T3), which are the main hormones produced by the thyroid gland.[A184697]    Methimazole may directly inhibit TPO, but has been shown in vivo to instead act as a competitive substrate for TPO, thus becoming iodinated itself and interfering with the iodination of thyroglobulin.[A184559] Another proposed theory is that methimazole’s sulfur moiety may interact directly with the iron atom at the centre of TPO’s heme molecule, thus inhibiting its ability to iodinate tyrosine residues.[A184694] Other proposed mechanisms with weaker evidence include methimazole binding directly to thyroglobulin or direct inhibition of thyroglobulin itself.[A184559]"
477,"The inhaler is indicated for the maintenance treatment of asthma as prophylactic therapy. The nasal spray is indicated for the treatment of the nasal symptoms of seasonal allergic and perennial allergic rhinitis.Mometasone is a corticosteroid not currently used in medical products. [Mometasone furoate] however, is still in use.Mometasone is a medium-potency synthetic corticosteroid with antiinflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. Studies in asthmatic patients have demonstrated that mometasone provides a favorable ratio of topical to systemic activity due to its primary local effect along with the extensive hepatic metabolism and the lack of active metabolites. Though effective for the treatment of asthma, glucocorticoids do not affect asthma symptoms immediately. Maximum improvement in symptoms following inhaled administration of mometasone furoate may not be achieved for 1 to 2 weeks or longer after starting treatment. When glucocorticoids are discontinued, asthma stability may persist for several days or longer. Mometasone has been shown in vitro to exhibit a binding affinity for the human glucocorticoid receptor which is approximately 12 times that of dexamethasone, 7 times that of triamcinolone acetonide, 5 times that of budesonide, and 1.5 times that of fluticasone. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.Unbound corticosteroids cross cell membranes and bind with high affinity to specific cytoplasmic receptors. Inflammation is decreased by diminishing the release of leukocytic acid hydrolases, prevention of macrophage accumulation at inflamed sites, interference with leukocyte adhesion to the capillary wall, reduction of capillary membrane permeability, reduction of complement components, inhibition of histamine and kinin release, and interference with the formation of scar tissue. The antiinflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, lipocortins, which control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Mometasone furoate has been shown in vitro to exhibit a binding affinity for the human glucocorticoid receptor which is approximately 12 times that of dexamethasone, 7 times that of triamcinolone acetonide, 5 times that of budesonide, and 1.5 times that of fluticasone."
478,"For use in the treatment of patients with pheochromocytoma, for preoperative preparation of patients for surgery, management of patients when surgery is contraindicated, and chronic treatment of patients with malignant pheochromocytoma.An inhibitor of the enzyme tyrosine 3-monooxygenase, and consequently of the synthesis of catecholamines. It is used to control the symptoms of excessive sympathetic stimulation in patients with pheochromocytoma. (Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed)In patients with pheochromocytoma, who produce excessive amounts of norepinephrine and epinephrine, administration of one to four grams of metyrosine per day has reduced catecholamine biosynthesis from about 35 to 80 percent as measured by the total excretion of catecholamines and their metabolites (metanephrine and vanillylmandelic acid). The maximum biochemical effect usually occurs within two to three days, and the urinary concentration of catecholamines and their metabolites usually returns to pretreatment levels within three to four days after metyrosine is discontinued. Most patients with pheochromocytoma treated with metyrosine experience decreased frequency and severity of hypertensive attacks with their associated headache, nausea, sweating, and tachycardia. In patients who respond, blood pressure decreases progressively during the first two days of therapy with metyrosine; after withdrawal, blood pressure usually increases gradually to pretreatment values within two to three days.Metyrosine inhibits tyrosine hydroxylase, which catalyzes the first transformation in catecholamine biosynthesis, i.e., the conversion of tyrosine to dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA). Because the first step is also the rate-limiting step, blockade of tyrosine hydroxylase activity results in decreased endogenous levels of catecholamines and their synthesis. This consequently, depletes the levels of the catecholamines dopamine, adrenaline and noradrenaline in the body,usually measured as decreased urinary excretion of catecholamines and their metabolites. One main end result of the catecholamine depletion is a decrease in blood presure."
479,"Alprostadil is indicated for palliative, not definitive, therapy to temporarily maintain the patency of the ductus arteriosus until corrective or palliative surgery can be performed in neonates who have congenital heart defects and who depend upon the patent ductus for survival.[L45038] It is also indicated for the treatment of erectile dysfunction due to neurogenic, vasculogenic, psychogenic, or mixed etiology,[L45028,L45033] and as an adjunct to other diagnostic tests in the diagnosis of erectile dysfunction.[L45028]Alprostadil is a chemically-identical synthetic form of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), a potent vasodilator produced endogenously. In 1996, the FDA approved the use of alprostadil, administered either with an intracavernosal injection or an intraurethral suppository, for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, and it is used in men for whom oral treatment is either contraindicated or ineffective. After administration, alprostadil promotes smooth muscle relaxation of the corpus cavernosal.[A257068,A257088]     Alprostadil is also used in neonatal patients with congenital heart defects that depend on a patent ductus for survival until corrective or palliative surgery can be performed. This drug causes vasodilation by directly affecting vascular and ductus arteriosus (DA) smooth muscle, preventing or reversing the functional closure of the DA that occurs shortly after birth. This results in increased pulmonary or systemic blood flow in infants.[A34474,L45038,L45063]Prostaglandin E1 is produced endogenously to relax vascular smooth muscle and cause vasodilation. As a synthetic form of prostaglandin E1, alprostadil has the same pharmacodynamic effects.[A257068] Alprostadil inhibits platelet aggregation, has anti-inflammatory effects, interferes with immune responses, and stimulates factor X, a blood coagulation enzyme.[A34470]    In adult males, the use of alprostadil may lead to prolonged erection and priapism, penile fibrosis, hypotension, and injection site bleeding.[L45028] In patients treated up to 24 months with alprostadil, the incidence of prolonged erections (>4 hours long) was 4% of all, and the incidence of priapism (erections greater than 6 hours in duration) was <1%.[L45033] Patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease treated with alprostadil may also have higher cardiac risk.[L45028] Neonates with congenital heart defects treated with alprostadil may experience apnea. Apnea is experienced by 10-12% of neonates and is more common in those weighing less than 2 kg at birth. The administration of alprostadil to neonates may also result in gastric outlet obstruction secondary to antral hyperplasia.[L45038]Alprostadil is a smooth muscle relaxant that promotes vasodilation and platelet aggregation inhibition. In neonatal patients with ductus arteriosus patency, alprostadil relaxes the ductus arteriosus (DA) smooth muscle, preventing or reversing the functional closure of the DA that occurs shortly after birth. This results in increased pulmonary or systemic blood flow in infants. Alprostadil appears to be most effective within 96 hours after birth since the DA rapidly loses its responsiveness to alprostadil.[L45063]     When administered by intracavernosal injection or as an intraurethral suppository, alprostadil acts locally to relax the trabecular smooth muscle of the corpora cavernosa and the cavernosal arteries. Swelling, elongation, and rigidity of the penis result when arterial blood rapidly flows into the corpus cavernosum to expand the lacunar spaces. The entrapped blood reduces the venous blood outflow as sinusoids compress against the tunica albuginea leading to penile rigidity. This is referred to as the corporal veno-occlusive mechanism.[A257073,L45033,L45068]"
480,"For patients infected with Pediculus humanus capitis (head lice and their ova) of the scalp hair.Malathion is a parasympathomimetic organophosphate compound that is used as an insecticide for the treatment of head lice. Malathion is an irreversible cholinesterase inhibitor and has low human toxicity.Malathion is an organophosphate insecticide commonly used to control mosquitos and other flying insects. Pharmaceutically, malathion is used to eliminate head lice. The principal toxicological effect of malathion is cholinesterase inhibition, due primarily to malaoxon and to phosphorus thionate impurities.Malathion is a nonsystemic, wide-spectrum organophosphate insecticide. It inhibits acetylcholinesterase activity of most eukaryotes. Malathion is toxic to aquatic organisms, but has a relatively low toxicity for birds and mammals. The major metabolites of malathion are mono- and di-carboxylic acid derivatives, and malaoxon is a minor metabolite. However, it is malaoxon that is the strongest cholinesterase inhibitor. Cholinesterases catalyze the hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into choline and acetic acid, a reaction necessary to allow a cholinergic neuron to return to its resting state after activation. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of cholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing muscle spasms and ultimately death."
481,"Also used to treat other malignancies such as lymphoma, non-lymphocytic leukemia, and glioblastoma multiforme.A semisynthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin that exhibits antitumor activity. Etoposide inhibits DNA synthesis by forming a complex with topoisomerase II and DNA. This complex induces breaks in double stranded DNA and prevents repair by topoisomerase II binding. Accumulated breaks in DNA prevent entry into the mitotic phase of cell division, and lead to cell death. Etoposide acts primarily in the G2 and S phases of the cell cycle.Etoposide is an antineoplastic agent and an epipodophyllotoxin (a semisynthetic derivative of the podophyllotoxins). It inhibits DNA topoisomerase II, thereby ultimately inhibiting DNA synthesis. Etoposide is cell cycle dependent and phase specific, affecting mainly the S and G2 phases. Two different dose-dependent responses are seen. At high concentrations (10 &micro;g/mL or more), lysis of cells entering mitosis is observed. At low concentrations (0.3 to 10 &micro;g/mL), cells are inhibited from entering prophase. It does not interfere with microtubular assembly. The predominant macromolecular effect of etoposide appears to be the induction of DNA strand breaks by an interaction with DNA-topoisomerase II or the formation of free radicals.Etoposide inhibits DNA topoisomerase II, thereby inhibiting DNA re-ligation. This causes critical errors in DNA synthesis at the premitotic stage of cell division and can lead to apoptosis of the cancer cell. Etoposide is cell cycle dependent and phase specific, affecting mainly the S and G2 phases of cell division. Inhibition of the topoisomerase II alpha isoform results in the anti-tumour activity of etoposide. The drug is also capable of inhibiting the beta isoform but inhibition of this target is not associated with the anti-tumour activity. It is instead associated with the carcinogenic effect. "
482,"Used as adjunctive therapy in edema associated with congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, and corticosteroid and estrogen therapy. Also used in the management of hypertension either as the sole therapeutic agent or to enhance the effect of other antihypertensive drugs in the more severe forms of hypertension.A thiazide diuretic with actions and uses similar to those of hydrochlorothiazide. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p822)Hydroflumethiazide is an oral thiazide used to treat hypertension and edema. High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. Like other thiazides, Hydroflumethiazide promotes water loss from the body (diuretics). Thiazides inhibit Na+/Cl- reabsorption from the distal convoluted tubules in the kidneys. Thiazides also cause loss of potassium and an increase in serum uric acid. Thiazides are often used to treat hypertension, but their hypotensive effects are not necessarily due to their diuretic activity. Thiazides have been shown to prevent hypertension-related morbidity and mortality although the mechanism is not fully understood. Thiazides cause vasodilation by activating calcium-activated potassium channels (large conductance) in vascular smooth muscles and inhibiting various carbonic anhydrases in vascular tissue.Hydroflumethiazide is a thiazide diuretic that inhibits water reabsorption in the nephron by inhibiting the sodium-chloride symporter (SLC12A3) in the distal convoluted tubule, which is responsible for 5% of total sodium reabsorption. Normally, the sodium-chloride symporter transports sodium and chloride from the lumen into the epithelial cell lining the distal convoluted tubule. The energy for this is provided by a sodium gradient established by sodium-potassium ATPases on the basolateral membrane. Once sodium has entered the cell, it is transported out into the basolateral interstitium via the sodium-potassium ATPase, causing an increase in the osmolarity of the interstitium, thereby establishing an osmotic gradient for water reabsorption. By blocking the sodium-chloride symporter, Hydroflumethiazide effectively reduces the osmotic gradient and water reabsorption throughout the nephron."
483,"In the United States, oxcarbazepine is indicated for use as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures in adults and as monotherapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures in pediatric patients aged 4 years and above, and as adjunctive therapy in pediatric patients aged 2 years and above with partial-onset seizures.[L8627]     In Canada, oxcarbazepine is indicated for use as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients 6 years of age and older.[L8630]Oxcarbazepine is an anti-epileptic medication used in the treatment of partial onset seizures that was first approved for use in the United States in 2000.[L8627,L8630,L8633] It is a structural derivative of [carbamazepine][A186101] and exerts a majority of its activity via a pharmacologically active metabolite, MHD, which exists as a racemate in the blood - a pro-drug of the more active (S)-enantiomer is also marketed as a separate anti-epileptic under the name [eslicarbazepine].[A186011] Compared to other anti-epileptic drugs, which are generally metabolized via the cytochrome P450 system, oxcarbazepine has a reduced propensity for involvement in drug-drug interactions owing to its primarily reductive metabolism.[A186032]Oxcarbazepine is an anticonvulsant drug that reduces the incidence of seizures in epilepsy by inhibiting abnormal electrical activity in the brain.[L8627,L8630,L8633]    There have been rare reports of oxcarbazepine resulting in the development of hematologic abnormalities, including agranulocytosis and aplastic anemia. Patients should be undergo frequent laboratory testing and should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of blood dyscrasias. Oxcarbazepine has also been associated with the development of dermatologic reactions which can progress from a simple rash to potentially fatal reactions such as toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) or Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS). Patients with the HLA-A 3101 and/or HLA-B 1502 alleles may be at higher risk of this reaction. Oxcarbazepine should be discontinued at the first sign of a drug-induced skin reaction.[L8627,L8630,L8633]The exact mechanism through which oxcarbazepine and its active metaoblite, MHD, exert their anti-epileptic effects is unclear, but is thought to primarily involve the blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels.[L8627,L8630,L8633,A186104] The opening and closing of sodium channels allows for the propagation of action potentials along neurons - in epilepsy, these action potentials can occur in excess of that required for normal function, and the repetitive and pathological firing of these action potentials leads to seizure activity. Both oxcarbazepine and MHD are thought to inhibit seizure activity by binding to the inactive state of voltage-gated sodium channels, thus prolonging the period in which the receptor is unavailable for action potential propagation.[A186101] This helps to stabilize hyperexcited neuronal membranes, inhibit repetitive neuron firing, and prevent the spread of seizure activity within the CNS without affecting normal neuronal transmission.[L8627,L8630,L8633]    Increased potassium conductance and modulation of voltage-activated calcium channels is also thought to play a role in the anti-seizure activity of oxcarbazepine.[L8627,L8630,L8633] Inhibition of glutamatergic activity was thought to contribute to oxcarbazepine's activity[A34516], but this effect could not be replicated _in vivo_.[A186104]"

Future uses may include the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder and severe behavioral disorders in autism. Structurally and pharmacologically similar to clozapine, propiomazine binds to alpha(1), dopamine, histamine H1, muscarinic, and serotonin type 2 (5-HT2) receptors.Although propiomazine is a phenothiazine, it is not used as an antipsychotic. It posesses antihistamine effects and is mostly used as a sedative in treating insomnia.Propiomazine acts as an antagonist of dopamine 1, 2, and 4 receptors, serotonin (5-HT) receptor types 2A and 2C, muscarinic receptors 1 through 5, alpha(1)-receptors, and histamine H1-receptors. Its main use as a sedative is due to its antihistamine effect."
485,"Used to treat respiratory tract, urinary and soft tissue infections.Roxithromycin is a semi-synthethic macrolide antibiotic that is structurally and pharmacologically similar to [erythromycin], [azithromycin], or [clarithromycin]. It was shown to be more effective against certain Gram-negative bacteria, particularly _Legionella pneumophila_. Roxithromycin exerts its antibacterial action by binding to the bacterial ribosome and interfering with bacterial protein synthesis. It is marketed in Australia as a treatment for respiratory tract, urinary and soft tissue infections.Roxithromycin has the following antibacterial spectrum in vitro: Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae (Pneumococcus), Neisseria meningitides (Meningococcus), Listeria monocytogenes, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Legionella pneumophila, Helicobacter (Campylobacter), Gardnerella vaginalis, Bordetella pertussis, Moraxella catarrhalis (Branhamella Catarrhalis), and Haemophilus ducreyi. Roxithromycin is highly concentrated in polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages, achieving intracellular concentrations greater than those outside the cell. Roxithromycin enhances the adhesive and chemotactic functions of these cells which in the presence of infection produce phagocytosis and bacterial lysis. Roxithromycin also possesses intracellular bactericidal activity.Roxithromycin prevents bacterial growth by interfering with their protein synthesis. It binds to the 50S subunit of bacterial ribosomes and inhibits the translocation of peptides."
486,"For the treatment of urinary tract infections caused by susceptible gram-negative microorganisms, including the majority of E. Coli, Enterobacter species,Klebsiella species, and Proteus species.Nalidixic acid is a synthetic 1,8-naphthyridine antimicrobial agent with a limited bacteriocidal spectrum. It is an inhibitor of the A subunit of bacterial DNA gyrase.Nalidixic acid is a quinolone antibacterial agent for oral administration. Nalidixic acid has marked antibacterial activity against gram-negative bacteria including Enterobacter species, Escherichia coli, Morganella Morganii; Proteus Mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and Providencia rettgeri. lidixic acid is bactericidal and is effective over the entire urinary pH range. Conventional chromosomal resistance to nalidixic acid taken in full dosage has been reported to emerge in approximately 2 to 14 percent of patients during treatment; however, bacterial resistance to nalidixic acid has not been shown to be transferable via R factor.Evidence exists for Nalidixic acid that its active metabolite, hydroxynalidixic acid, binds strongly, but reversibly, to DNA, interfering with synthesis of RNA and, consequently, with protein synthesis."
487,"Phenelzine is indicated for the treatment of nonendogenous, neurotic or atypical depression for patients that do not tolerate other forms of therapy.[L1356]     Atypical depression has a high prevalence rate, starts in early life, tends to last longer, is more likely to occur in people with bipolar disorder, has a high comorbidity with anxiety disorder and carries more risk of suicidal behavior. It is important to specify the atypical feature to predict the clinical course of depression and hence generate the best treatment and service. The featuring symptoms of the atypical feature include mood reactivity, two or more of this symptoms: 1) increased appetite, 2) increased sleep, 3) leaden paralysis and 4) interpersonal rejection sensitivity and should not have melancholic or catatonic features of depression.[A31917]    Neurotic depression is a depression of an emotionally unstable person. It is a secondary condition to major personality disorder, neuroses and drug use disorders. Likewise, a primary depression with a family history of depression spectrum disease would fit in this category.[A31922]    A nonendogenous depression is characterized by a disturbance in mood and general outlook. The physical symptoms tend to be less severe and it often occurs in response to stressful life events that keep occurring over a large period of time generating a continuous stress in the daily living.[A31924]Phenelzine, with the formula β-phenylethylhydrazine, is a monoamine oxidase inhibiting antidepressant that is effective in the treatment of panic disorder and social anxiety disorder.[A15753] It was developed by Parke Davis and originally FDA approved on June 9th, 1961. It is currently approved under prescription by the name of Nardil.The elimination of monoamine oxidase by phenelzine results in the elevation of brain amines such as 2-phenylethylamine which is a metabolite of phenelzine. These amines have then marked effects on the uptake and release of catecholamines and serotonin in nerve endings.[A31925] Phenelzine is shown to elevate brain levels of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and alanine (ALA) as well as to inhibit the activity of the transaminases that normally metabolize these amino acids. In preclinical studies, it has been shown to be neuroprotective in cerebral ischemia.[A15753]The basic mechanism of action of phenelzine acts as an inhibitor and substrate of monoamine oxidase which subsequently causes an elevation in brain levels of catecholamines and serotonin. It also presents a similar structure to amphetamine which explains the effect on the uptake and release of dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin. Phenelzine has been reported to inhibit tyrosine aminotransferase, aromatic amino acid decarboxylase, and dopamine B-hydroxylase.[A31925]"
488,"Estradiol is indicated in various preparations for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms and vulvar and vaginal atrophy due to menopause, for the treatment of hypoestrogenism due to hypogonadism, castration, or primary ovarian failure, and for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis. It is also used for the treatment of breast cancer (only for palliation therapy) in certain men or women with metastatic disease, and for the treatment of androgen-dependent prostate cancer (only for palliation therapy).[L11485,L11494,L11497] It is also used in combination with other hormones as a component of oral contraceptive pills for preventing pregnancy (most commonly as [DB00977], a synthetic form of estradiol).    **A note on duration of treatment**    Recommendations for treatment of menopausal symptoms changed drastically following the release of results and early termination of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) studies in 2002 as concerns were raised regarding estrogen use.[A31626] Specifically, the combined estrogen–progestin group was discontinued after about 5 years of follow up due to a statistically significant increase in invasive breast cancer and in cardiovascular events.[A31627]     Following extensive critique of the WHI results, Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) is now recommended to be used only for a short period (for 3-5 years postmenopause) in low doses, and in women without a history of breast cancer or increased risk of cardiovascular or thromboembolic disease.[A31628] Estrogen for postmenopausal symptoms should always be given with a progestin component due to estrogen's stimulatory effects on the endometrium; in women with an intact uterus, unopposed estrogen has been shown to promote the growth of the endometrium which can lead to endometrial hyperplasia and possibly cancer over the long-term.     Estradiol is a naturally occurring hormone circulating endogenously in females. It is commercially available in several hormone therapy products for managing conditions associated with reduced estrogen, such as vulvovaginal atrophy and hot flashes. Some available forms of estradiol include oral tablets, injections, vaginal rings, transdermal patches, sprays, gels, and creams.[L11485,L11488,L11491, L11494,L11497,L11500,L11503]     When used for oral or IM administration, estradiol is commonly synthesized as a pro-drug ester (such as [DB13952], [DB13953], [DB13954], [DB13955], and [DB13956]). Because it has a low oral bioavailability on its own, estradiol is commonly formulated with an ester side-chain. [DB00977] (EE) is a synthetic form of estradiol commonly used as the estrogenic component of most combination oral contraceptive pills (OCPs). Ethinyl estradiol is different from estradiol due to its higher biovailability and increased resistance to metabolism, rendering it more suitable for oral administration.Estradiol acts on the on the estrogen receptors to relieve vasomotor systems (such as hot flashes) and urogenital symptoms (such as vaginal dryness and dyspareunia).[A190402,A190405,A190408]    Estradiol has also been shown to exert favorable effects on bone density by inhibiting bone resorption. Estrogen appears to inhibit bone resorption [A190402,L11560] and may have beneficial effects on the plasma lipid profile.[A190405,L11530] Estrogens cause an increase in hepatic synthesis of various proteins, which include sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), and thyroid-binding globulin (TBG).  Estrogens are known to suppress the formation of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in the anterior pituitary gland.[L11485]     **A note on hyper-coagulable state, cardiovascular health, and blood pressure**    Estradiol may cause an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, DVT, and stroke, and its use should be avoided in patients at high risk of these conditions.[L11560]  Estrogen induces a hyper-coagulable state, which is also associated with both estrogen-containing oral contraceptive (OC) use and pregnancy. Although estrogen causes an increase in levels of plasma renin and angiotensin. Estrogen-induced increases in angiotensin, causing sodium retention, which is likely to be the mechanism causing hypertension after oral contraceptive treatment.[A190402]  Estrogen is found in the the breast, uterine, ovarian, skin, prostate, bone, fat, and brain tissues. The main source of estrogen in adult women during the reproductive period of life is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol each day. After menopause, however, the majority of endogenous estrogen is produced by transformation of androstenedione (which is secreted by the adrenal cortex) to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Both estrone and its sulphate conjugated form, estrone sulphate, represent the most abundant estrogens found in postmenopausal women.[L11530]     Estradiol, however, is considerably more potent than estrone and estriol at the estrogen receptor (ER). As a result, the higher estrone concentration in postmenopausal population, can cause various undesirable effects. These effects may include hot flashes, chills, vaginal dryness, mood swings, irregular menstruation, and chills, in addition to sleep problems.[L11530]    Estradiol workings by binding to subtypes of the estrogen receptor: estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and estrogen receptor beta (ERβ). It also exerts potent agonism of G Protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), which is recognized an important regulator of this drug's rapid effects. Once the estrogen receptor has bound to its ligand, it enters the nucleus of the target cell, regulating gene transcription and formation of of messenger RNA. This mRNA makes contact with ribosomes producing specific proteins that express the effect of estradiol upon the target cell. Agonism of estrogen receptors increases pro-estrogenic effects, leading to the relief of vasomotor and urogenital symptoms of a postmenopausal or low estradiol state.[A31620,L11485,L11497]    "

It is an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase.Mefenamic acid, an anthranilic acid derivative, is a member of the fenamate group of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It exhibits anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activities. Similar to other NSAIDs, mefenamic acid inhibits prostaglandin synthetase.Mefenamic acid binds the prostaglandin synthetase receptors COX-1 and COX-2, inhibiting the action of prostaglandin synthetase. As these receptors have a role as a major mediator of inflammation and/or a role for prostanoid signaling in activity-dependent plasticity, the symptoms of pain are temporarily reduced."

Acyclovir is generally used first line in the treatment of these viruses and some products are indicated for patients as young as 6 years old.[L7321]    Acyclovir was granted FDA approval on 29 March 1982.[L7318]Acyclovir is a nucleoside analog that inhibits the action of viral DNA polymerase and DNA replication of different herpesvirus.[L7303,L7315,L7318,L7321,L7324,L7327] Acyclovir has a wide therapeutic window as overdose is rare in otherwise healthy patients.[L7315]Acyclovir is becomes acyclovir monophosphate due to the action of viral thymidine kinase.[A180757] Acyclovir monophosphate is converted to the diphosphate form by guanylate kinase.[A903] Acyclovir diphosphate is converted to acyclovir triphosphate by nucleoside diphosphate kinase, pyruvate kinase, creatine kinase, phosphoglycerate kinase, succinyl-CoA synthetase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and adenylosuccinate synthetase.[A903,A180781] Acyclovir triphosphate has higher affinity for viral DNA polymerase than cellular DNA polymerase and incorporates into the DNA where the missing 2' and 3' carbons causes DNA chain termination.[A180757] In other cases acyclovir triphosphate competes so strongly for viral DNA polymerase that other bases cannot associate with the enzyme, inactivating it.[A180757]"
491,"Naproxen is indicated for the management of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, tendinitis, bursitis, acute gout, primary dysmenorrhea, and for the relief of mild to moderate pain.[L6582][L6583][A178975] Further, it is first-line therapy for osteoarthritis, acute gouty arthritis, dysmenorrhea, and musculoskeletal inflammation and pain.[A178975]Naproxen is classified as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory dug (NSAID) and was initially approved for prescription use in 1976 and then for over-the-counter (OTC) use in 1994.[A178975] It can effectively manage acute pain as well as pain related to rheumatic diseases, and has a well studied adverse effect profile.[A179098] Given its overall tolerability and effectiveness, naproxen can be considered a first line treatment for a variety of clinical situations requiring analgesia.[A179098] Naproxen is available in both immediate and delayed release formulations, in combination with sumatriptan to treat migraines, and in combination with esomeprazole to lower the risk of developing gastric ulcers.[L6582][L6583][L7309][L7312]Naproxen is an established non-selective NSAID and is useful as an analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic.[A179098] Similar to other NSAIDs, the pharmacological activity of naproxen can be attributed to the inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase, which in turn reduces prostaglandin synthesis in various tissues and fluids including the synovial fluid, gastric mucosa, and the blood.[A179098]     Although naproxen is an effective analgesic, it can have unintended deleterious effects in the patient. For instance, naproxen can adversely affect blood pressure control.[A179224] A study found that use of naproxen induced an increase in blood pressure, although the increase was not as significant as that found with ibuprofen use.[A179224]    Further, studies have found that the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding is on average four-fold higher for individuals taking NSAIDs.[A179227] Other factors that increase the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding include concurrent use of corticosteroids or anticoagulants, and a history of gastrointestinal ulcers.[A179227]As with other non-selective NSAIDs, naproxen exerts it's clinical effects by blocking COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes leading to decreased prostaglandin synthesis.[A178975] Although both enzymes contribute to prostaglandin production, they have unique functional differences.[A178975] The COX-1 enzymes is constitutively active and can be found in normal tissues such as the stomach lining, while the COX-2 enzyme is inducible and produces prostaglandins that mediate pain, fever and inflammation.[A178990] The COX-2 enzyme mediates the desired antipyretic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties offered by Naproxen, while undesired adverse effects such as gastrointestinal upset and renal toxicities are linked to the COX-1 enzyme.[A178990]"
492,"For the treatment of mild to moderate essential hypertension, mild to moderate congestive heart failure, and to reduce the cardiovascular risk of individuals with hypertension or post-myocardial infarction and stable coronary disease. Perindopril is a nonsulfhydryl prodrug that belongs to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor class of medications. It is rapidly metabolized in the liver to perindoprilat, its active metabolite, following oral administration. Perindoprilat is a potent, competitive inhibitor of ACE, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of angiotensin I (ATI) to angiotensin II (ATII). ATII regulates blood pressure and is a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Perindopril may be used to treat mild to moderate essential hypertension, mild to moderate congestive heart failure, and to reduce the cardiovascular risk of individuals with hypertension or post-myocardial infarction and stable coronary disease.Perindopril is a nonsulfhydryl prodrug that is metabolized via first pass effect (62%) and systemic hydrolysis (38%) to perindoprilat, its active metabolite, following oral administration. Perindoprilat lowers blood pressure by antagonizing the effect of the RAAS. The RAAS is a homeostatic mechanism for regulating hemodynamics, water and electrolyte balance. During sympathetic stimulation or when renal blood pressure or blood flow is reduced, renin is released from the granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. In the blood stream, renin cleaves circulating angiotensinogen to ATI, which is subsequently cleaved to ATII by ACE. ATII increases blood pressure using a number of mechanisms. First, it stimulates the secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone travels to the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and collecting tubule of nephrons where it increases sodium and water reabsorption by increasing the number of sodium channels and sodium-potassium ATPases on cell membranes. Second, ATII stimulates the secretion of vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone or ADH) from the posterior pituitary gland. ADH stimulates further water reabsorption from the kidneys via insertion of aquaporin-2 channels on the apical surface of cells of the DCT and collecting tubules. Third, ATII increases blood pressure through direct arterial vasoconstriction. Stimulation of the Type 1 ATII receptor on vascular smooth muscle cells leads to a cascade of events resulting in myocyte contraction and vasoconstriction. In addition to these major effects, ATII induces the thirst response via stimulation of hypothalamic neurons. ACE inhibitors inhibit the rapid conversion of ATI to ATII and antagonize RAAS-induced increases in blood pressure. ACE (also known as kininase II) is also involved in the enzymatic deactivation of bradykinin, a vasodilator. Inhibiting the deactivation of bradykinin increases bradykinin levels and may sustain the effects of perindoprilat by causing increased vasodilation and decreased blood pressure.There are two isoforms of ACE: the somatic isoform, which exists as a glycoprotein comprised of a single polypeptide chain of 1277; and the testicular isoform, which has a lower molecular mass and is thought to play a role in sperm maturation and binding of sperm to the oviduct epithelium. Somatic ACE has two functionally active domains, N and C, which arise from tandem gene duplication. Although the two domains have high sequence similarity, they play distinct physiological roles. The C-domain is predominantly involved in blood pressure regulation while the N-domain plays a role in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and proliferation. ACE inhibitors bind to and inhibit the activity of both domains, but have much greater affinity for and inhibitory activity against the C-domain. Perindoprilat, the active metabolite of perindopril, competes with ATI for binding to ACE and inhibits and enzymatic proteolysis of ATI to ATII. Decreasing ATII levels in the body decreases blood pressure by inhibiting the pressor effects of ATII as described in the Pharmacology section above. Perindopril also causes an increase in plasma renin activity likely due to a loss of feedback inhibition mediated by ATII on the release of renin and/or stimulation of reflex mechanisms via baroreceptors.

It is a alkylating antineoplastic agent that is used in lymphatic malignancies, and causes mainly gastrointestinal and bone marrow damage.Uracil Mustard selectively inhibits the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The guanine and cytosine content correlates with the degree of Uracil Mustard-induced cross-linking. At high concentrations of the drug, cellular RNA and protein synthesis are also suppressed.After activation, it binds preferentially to the guanine and cytosine moieties of DNA, leading to cross-linking of DNA, thus inhibiting DNA synthesis and function."

495,"In the US, sulfasalazine is indicated to treat mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and to prolong the remission period between acute attacks of ulcerative colitis.[L39065] Sulfasalazine is also indicated as an adjunct therapy in severe ulcerative colitis.[L39065]For the delayed-release tablet formulation, sulfasalazine is also indicated to treat rheumatoid arthritis in pediatric patients who have responded inadequately to salicylates or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or polyarticular-course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis with the same patients' characteristics.[L39065]Sulfasalazine is an anti-inflammatory drug structurally related to salicylates and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. It is indicated for managing inflammatory diseases such as ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).[L39065, A255582] Metabolized by intestinal bacteria, sulfasalazine is broken down into [mesalazine] and [sulfapyridine], 2 compounds that carry out the main pharmacological activity of sulfasalazine.[A255582]     Sulfasalazine was first used in 1940 for rheumatic polyarthritis, and has been firmly established itself as one fo the most useful disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD).[A255582] Compared to the first line treatment of RA like methotrexate, sulfasalazine is almost as efficacious as methotrexate although with slightly less tolerability. However, sulfasalazine has less teratogenic side effects and faster onset of action compared to conventional DMARD.[A255582] Sulfasalazine fell out of favor as the drug of choice for RA due to poorly designed clinical trials in 1950 but regained interest from the clinical community in the late 1970.[A255582]    Although sulfasalazine is only approved by the FDA for ulcerative colitis, research have shown that sulfasalazine is also beneficial for patients with Crohn's disease.[A255592] Meta-analysis of 19 randomized controlled trials indicated that sulfasalazine is superior to placebo in inducing remission; however, with no supported evidence of mucosal healing, sulfasalazine is not FDA-recommmended for treatment of Crohn's disease.[A255597,A255602,A255607]The mode of action of sulfasalazine or its metabolites, 5-aminosalicylic acid and sulfapyridine, is still under investigation but may be related to the anti-inflammatory and/or immunomodulatory properties that have been observed in animal and in vitro models, to its affinity for connective tissue, and/or to the relatively high concentration it reaches in serous fluids, the liver, and intestinal walls, as demonstrated in autoradiographic studies in animals. In ulcerative colitis, clinical studies utilizing rectal administration of sulfasalazine, sulfapyridine, and 5-aminosalicylic acid have indicated that the major therapeutic action may reside in the 5-aminosalicylic acid moiety. The relative contribution of the parent drug and the major metabolites in rheumatoid arthritis is unknown.[L39065]Although the exact mechanism of action of sulfasalazine is not fully understood, it is thought to be mediated through the inhibition of various inflammatory molecules.[L44478] Research have found that sulfasalazine and its metabolites, mesalazine and sulfapyridine, can inhibit leukotrienes and prostaglandins by blocking the cyclo-oxygenase and lipoxygenase pathway.[A255143] Specific enzymes that were investigated include phospholipase A2, cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), and arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase.[A16801,A10316,A4391,A10319] Inhibitory activities on other non-arachidonic acid derivatives have also been observed, including PPAR gamma, NF-Kb, and IkappaB kinases alpha and beta.[A16799,A16797,A255577,A255138]"
496,"May be used as a first line agent to treat uncomplicated hypertension, isolated systolic hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. May be used as a first line agent to delay progression of diabetic nephropathy. Candesartan may be also used as a second line agent in the treatment of congestive heart failure, systolic dysfunction, myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease in those intolerant of ACE inhibitors.Candesartan is an angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) that may be used alone or with other agents to treat hypertension. It is administered orally as the prodrug, candesartan cilexetil, which is rapidly converted to its active metabolite, candesartan, during absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. Candesartan lowers blood pressure by antagonizing the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS); it competes with angiotensin II for binding to the type-1 angiotensin II receptor (AT1) subtype and prevents the blood pressure increasing effects of angiotensin II. Unlike angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, ARBs do not have the adverse effect of dry cough. Candesartan may be used to treat hypertension, isolated systolic hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy and diabetic nephropathy. It may also be used as an alternative agent for the treatment of heart failure, systolic dysfunction, myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease.Candesartan cilexetil is an ARB prodrug that is rapidly converted to candesartan, its active metabolite, during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Candesartan confers blood pressure lowering effects by antagonizing the hypertensive effects of angiotensin II via the RAAS. RAAS is a homeostatic mechanism for regulating hemodynamics, water and electrolyte balance. During sympathetic stimulation or when renal blood pressure or blood flow is reduced, renin is released from granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. Renin cleaves circulating angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is cleaved by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II increases blood pressure by increasing total peripheral resistance, increasing sodium and water reabsorption in the kidneys via aldosterone secretion, and altering cardiovascular structure. Angiotensin II binds to two receptors: type-1 angiotensin II receptor (AT1) and type-2 angiotensin II receptor (AT2). AT1 is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that mediates the vasoconstrictive and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II. Studies performed in recent years suggest that AT2 antagonizes AT1-mediated effects and directly affects long-term blood pressure control by inducing vasorelaxation and increasing urinary sodium excretion. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are non-peptide competitive inhibitors of AT1. ARBs block the ability of angiotensin II to stimulate pressor and cell proliferative effects. Unlike ACE inhibitors, ARBs do not affect bradykinin-induced vasodilation. The overall effect of ARBs is a decrease in blood pressure.Candesartan selectively blocks the binding of angiotensin II to AT1 in many tissues including vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal glands. This inhibits the AT1-mediated vasoconstrictive and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II and results in an overall decrease in blood pressure. Candesartan is greater than 10,000 times more selective for AT1 than AT2. Inhibition of aldosterone secretion may increase sodium and water excretion while decreasing potassium excretion."

Fenoldopam is a racemic mixture with the R-isomer responsible for the biological activity. The R-isomer has approximately 250-fold higher affinity for D1-like receptors than does the S-isomer. In non-clinical studies, fenoldopam had no agonist effect on presynaptic D2-like dopamine receptors, or &alpha; or &beta; -adrenoceptors, nor did it affect angiotensin-converting enzyme activity. Fenoldopam may increase norepinephrine plasma concentration."
498,"Used to relieve anxiety, nervousness, and tension associated with anxiety disorders.Halazepam is a _benzodiazepine_ derivative drug exerting anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative, a muscle relaxing effects.[A1212, A178114] It has been shown to be less toxic than chlordiazepoxide or diazepam.[A1212] This drug is no longer marketed in the United States, and was withdrawn by _Schering_, its manufacturer, in 2009.[L6226, L6229]Benzodiazepines bind nonspecifically to benzodiazepine receptors BNZ1, which mediates sleep, and BNZ2, which affects affects muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, motor coordination, and memory. As benzodiazepine receptors are thought to be coupled to gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptors, this enhances the effects of GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA receptor. Binding of GABA to the site opens the chloride channel, resulting in a hyperpolarized cell membrane that prevents further excitation of the cell."
499,"For the management of postoperative pain and the maintenance of general anesthesia.A short-acting opioid anesthetic and analgesic derivative of fentanyl. It produces an early peak analgesic effect and fast recovery of consciousness. Alfentanil is effective as an anesthetic during surgery, for supplementation of analgesia during surgical procedures, and as an analgesic for critically ill patients.Alfentanil is a synthetic opioid analgesic. Alfentanil interacts predominately with the opioid mu-receptor. These mu-binding sites are discretely distributed in the human brain, spinal cord, and other tissues. In clinical settings, alfentanil exerts its principal pharmacologic effects on the central nervous system. Its primary actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation. Alfentanil may increase the patient's tolerance for pain and decrease the perception of suffering, although the presence of the pain itself may still be recognized. In addition to analgesia, alterations in mood, euphoria and dysphoria, and drowsiness commonly occur. Alfentanil depresses the respiratory centers, depresses the cough reflex, and constricts the pupils.Opiate receptors are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as both positive and negative regulators of synaptic transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine and noradrenaline is inhibited. Opioids also inhibit the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin and glucagon. Alfentanil's analgesic activity is, most likely, due to its conversion to morphine. Opioids close N-type voltage-operated calcium channels (OP2-receptor agonist) and open calcium-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channels (OP3 and OP1 receptor agonist). This results in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability."
500,"For the treatment of acute or chronic infections due to sensitive strains of certain gram-negative bacilli, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Cyclic polypeptide antibiotic from Bacillus colistinus. It is composed of Polymyxins E1 and E2 (or Colistins A, B, and C) which act as detergents on cell membranes. Colistin is less toxic than Polymyxin B, but otherwise similar; the methanesulfonate is used orally.Colistin is a polymyxin antibiotic agent. Polymyxins are cationic polypeptides that disrupt the bacterial cell membrane through a detergentlike mechanism. With the development of less toxic agents, such as extended-spectrum penicillins and cephalosporins, parenteral polymyxin use was largely abandoned, except for the treatment of multidrug-resistant pulmonary infections in patients with cystic fibrosis. More recently, however, the emergence of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, and the lack of new antimicrobial agents have led to the revived use of the polymyxins.Colistin is a surface active agent which penetrates into and disrupts the bacterial cell membrane. Colistin is polycationic and has both hydrophobic and lipophilic moieties. It interacts with the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane, changing its permeability. This effect is bactericidal. There is also evidence that polymyxins enter the cell and precipitate cytoplasmic components, primarily ribosomes."
501,"For the treatment of depressionMinaprine is a psychotropic drug which has proved to be effective in the treatment of various depressive states. Like most antidepressants minaprine antagonizes behavioral despair. Minaprine  is an amino-phenylpyridazine antidepressant reported to be relatively free of cardiotoxicity, drowsiness, and weight gain.Minaprine is an amino-phenylpyridazine antidepressant reported to be relatively free of cardiotoxicity, drowsiness, and weight gain. Similar to other antidepressant treatments, minaprine attenuates the beta-adrenergic receptor function. Studies have also shown that minaprine improves memory consolidation and that repeated drug administration leads to potentiation of this effect. Moreover, the effects of minaprine on memory consolidation are related to its dopaminergic action.Minaprine binds to serotonin type 2 receptors and to dopamine D1 and D2 type receptors. It also binds to the serotonin reuptake pump. Therefore, minaprine blocks the reuptake of both dopamine and serotonin. It is also, to a slight degree, cholinomimetic. Thus it may exhibit both mood-brightening and nootropic properties. It also acts as a reversible inhibitor of MAO-A (RIMA).It has also been found to inhibit acetylcholinesterase."
502,"Pentoxifylline is indicated for the treatment of intermittent claudication in patients with chronic occlusive arterial disease. Pentoxifylline may improve limb function and reduce symptoms but cannot replace other therapies such as surgical bypass or removal of vascular obstructions.[L30300]Pentoxifylline (PTX) is a synthetic dimethylxanthine derivative that modulates the rheological properties of blood and also has both anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.[A226415, L30300] Although originally developed to treat intermittent claudication, a form of exertion-induced leg pain common in patients with peripheral arterial disease, PTX has been investigated for its possible use in diverse conditions, including osteoradionecrosis, diabetic kidney disease, and generally any condition associated with fibrosis.[A226410, A226415, A226455] More recently, PTX has been suggested as a possible treatment for COVID-19-induced pulmonary complications due to its ability to regulate the production of inflammatory cytokines.[A226608]    Pentoxifylline has been marketed in Europe since 1972; PTX extended-release tablets sold under the trade name TRENTAL by US Pharm Holdings were first approved by the FDA on Aug 30, 1984, but have since been discontinued. A branded product, PENTOXIL, marketed by Upsher-Smith Laboratories, and generic forms marketed by Valeant Pharmaceuticals and APOTEX have been available since the late 1990s.[L30300]Pentoxifylline, a synthetic dimethylxanthine derivative structurally related to [theophylline] and [caffeine], exhibits hemorheological, anti-oxidative, and anti-inflammatory properties and is traditionally indicated in the treatment of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). In PAD patients with concurrent cerebrovascular and coronary artery diseases, pentoxifylline treatment has occasionally been associated with angina, arrhythmia, and hypotension. Concurrent use with [warfarin] should be associated with more frequent monitoring of prothrombin times. Also, patients with risk factors complicated by hemorrhages, such as retinal bleeding, peptic ulceration, and recent surgery, should be monitored periodically for bleeding signs.[L30300]Patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) may suffer from intermittent claudication, exertional leg pain that resolves upon rest, which is underscored by a complex etiology including vascular dysfunction (reduced limb perfusion, angiogenesis, and microcirculatory flow), systemic inflammation, and skeletal muscle dysfunction.[A226410] Pentoxifylline (PTX), (3,7-dimethyl-1-(5-oxohexyl)-3,7-dihydro-1H-purine-2,6-dione) or 1-(5-oxohexyl)-3,7-­dimethylxanthine, is a methyl-xanthine derivative that acts to lower blood viscosity by increasing erythrocyte flexibility, reducing plasma fibrinogen, inhibiting neutrophil activation, and suppressing erythrocyte/platelet aggregation; it also has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.[A226415, L30300] Although the precise mechanism of action has yet to be elucidated, numerous studies have suggested several effects of PTX.    The classical interpretation of PTX's broad effects is due to its ability to act, _in vitro_, as a non-specific cyclic-3',5'-phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor at millimolar concentrations; specifically, it has been proposed that inhibition of PDE type III and IV isozymes leads to elevated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which mediate diverse downstream effects.[A226420, A226425, A226430] This view has been challenged, specifically by observing those plasma concentrations of PTX in routine clinical use are typically only around 1μM, far lower than those used to inhibit PDEs _in vitro_.[A226430] Instead, several studies have suggested that PTX can modulate adenosine receptor function, specifically the Gα-coupled A2A receptor (A2AR). Whether PTX acts directly as an A2AR agonist is unclear, although it can clearly increase the response of A2AR to adenosine.[A16840, A16821, A226350, A226435] A2AR activation activates adenylyl cyclase, which increases intracellular cAMP levels; this observation may explain PTX's ability to increase intracellular cAMP in a PDE-independent fashion.[A226440]    Elevated cAMP levels have numerous downstream effects. cAMP-mediated activation of protein kinase A (PKA) suppresses nuclear translocation of NF-κB, which suppresses transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF-α), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and IL-6 as well as TNF-induced molecules such as adhesion molecules (ICAM1 and VCAM1) and the C-reactive protein (CRP).[A226415, A226445, A226450, A226455] PTX has also been shown to prevent the downstream phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ERK, which are responsible for assembling the NADPH oxidase involved in the neutrophil oxidative burst. This effect is due to a PKA-independent decrease in Akt phosphorylation and a PKA-dependent decrease in phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ERK.[A226450, A226465, A226470] This transcriptional regulation at least partially explains the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties of PTX.    Also, activated PKA can activate the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), which itself blocks SMAD-driven gene transcription, effectively disrupting transforming growth factor (TGF-β1) signalling.[A226440, A226475] This results in lower levels of fibrinogenic molecules such as collagens, fibronectin, connective tissue growth factor, and alpha-smooth muscle actin.[A226440, A226450, A226475, A226460] Hence, disruption of TGF-β1 signalling may explain the anti-fibrotic effects of PTX, including at least some of the decrease in blood viscosity.    The picture is complicated by the observation that PTX metabolites M1, M4, and M5 have been shown to inhibit C5 Des Arg- and formyl-methionylleucylphenylalanine-induced superoxide production in neutrophils and M1 and M5 significantly contribute to PTX's observed hemorheological effects.[A226415, A226430, A226480] Overall, PTX administration is associated with decreased pro-inflammatory molecules, an increase in anti-inflammatory molecules such as IL-10, and decreased production of fibrinogenic and cellular adhesion molecules."
503,"Used as a local (ophthalmic) anesthetic.Proparacaine is a topical anesthetic drug of the amino ester group. It is found in ophthalmic solutions at a concentration of 0.5% as the hydrochloride salt.Proparacaine stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses thereby effecting local anesthetic action. More specifically, proparacaine appears to bind or antagonize the function of voltage gated sodium channels.The exact mechanism whereby proparacaine and other local anesthetics influence the permeability of the cell membrane is unknown; however, several studies indicate that local anesthetics may limit sodium ion permeability through the lipid layer of the nerve cell membrane. Proparacaine may alter epithelial sodium channels through interaction with channel protein residues. This limitation prevents the fundamental change necessary for the generation of the action potential."
504,"[L13982] It may also be used to treat fluid and salt retention associated with congestive heart failure.[L13982]  The most significant modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and the most prominent contributor to all-cause mortality is hypertension.[A204155] Characterized by an office blood pressure of ≥140/90, hypertension is pervasive and impacts an estimated 25% of adults globally.[A204155] Treatment for hypertension should include a number of lifestyle changes (ie. reduced sodium intake) along with pharmacotherapy - it should be noted that treatment with several antihypertensive agents may be required in order to achieve blood pressure targets.[A204155]    Thiazide-like diuretics such as indapamide are a valuable tool for the treatment of hypertension and continue to grow in popularity, falling behind only ACE inhibitors in terms of prescription frequency.[A204134] When compared to [hydrochlorothiazide] (another commonly prescribed diuretic), indapamide has been shown to be superior at lowering systolic blood pressure, reducing left ventricular mass index, lowering oxidative stress, inhibiting platelet aggregation, and reducing microalbuminuria associated with diabetes.[A204134] Interestingly, unlike thiazide diuretics, several sources suggest that indapamide is not associated with glucose or lipid disturbances.[A204134,A204161]     Indapamide is characterized by both a methylindoline and a sulfamoyl chlorobenzamide functional group, with the former being largely responsible for the molecule’s lipid solubility.[A204158]Classified as a sulfonamide diuretic, indapamide is an effective antihypertensive agent and by extension, has shown efficacy in the prevention of target organ damage.[A203627,A203660]  Administration of indapamide produces water and electrolyte loss, with higher doses associated with increased diuresis.[A203627,A204068] Severe and clinically significant electrolyte disturbances may occur with indapamide use - for example, hypokalemia resulting from renal potassium loss may lead to QTc prolongation.[A203627,A204062] Further electrolyte imbalances may occur due to renal excretion of sodium, chloride, and magnesium.[A203627,A204062,A204068]     Other indapamide induced changes include increases in plasma renin and aldosterone, and reduced calcium excretion in the urine.[A203627,A204074,A204131] In many studies investigating the effects of indapamide in both non-diabetic and diabetic hypertensive patients, glucose tolerance was not significantly altered.[A203627] However, additional studies are necessary to assess the long term metabolic impacts of indapamide, since thiazide related impaired glucose tolerance can take several years to develop in non-diabetic patients.[A203627]Indapamide acts on the nephron, specifically at the proximal segment of the distal convoluted tubule where it inhibits the Na+/Cl- cotransporter, leading to reduced sodium reabsorption.[A203519,A16729] As a result, sodium and water are retained in the lumen of the nephron for urinary excretion.[A185180] The effects that follow include reduced plasma volume, reduced venous return, lower cardiac output, and ultimately decreased blood pressure.[A16729]    Interestingly, it is likely that thiazide-like diuretics such as indapamide have additional blood pressure lowering mechanisms that are unrelated to diuresis.[A16729] This is exemplified by the observation that the antihypertensive effects of thiazides are sustained 4-6 weeks after initiation of therapy, despite recovering plasma and extracellular fluid volumes.[A16729]     Some studies have suggested that indapamide may decrease responsiveness to pressor agents while others have suggested it can decrease peripheral resistance.[A203627] Although it is clear that diuresis contributes to the antihypertensive effects of indapamide, further studies are needed to investigate the medication’s ability to decrease peripheral vascular resistance and relax vascular smooth muscle.[A203627]"
505,"Tropicamide is indicated to induce mydriasis (dilation of the pupil) for diagnostic procedures and in conditions where short-term pupil dilation is desired, either as monotherapy [L32103] or in combination with [hydroxyamphetamine] [L32178] or [phenylephrine].[L46332] It provides clinically significant mydriasis with partial cycloplegia.[L32178]Tropicamide is an alkaloid atropine‐derived anticholinergic drug and a non‐selective antagonist of muscarinic acetylcholine (mACh) receptors.[A230103] Usually available in ophthalmic formulations, tropicamide is used to cause mydriasis and cycloplegia for eye exams or ocular procedures.[L32178] Oral tropicamide has been investigated as a potential drug to relieve sialorrhea in patients with Parkinson's Disease.[A229958]Tropicamide is an anticholinergic drug and that works by non‐selectively blocking muscarinic receptors to cause mydriasis and cycloplegia. It relaxes the pupillary sphincter to dilate the pupil.[A229958] The onset of tropicamide‐induced mydriasis is about 10 to 15 minutes,[A230103] with optimal effect occurring 25 to 30 minutes post-administration. Mydriasis caused by tropicamide wears off within four to eight hours, but it was seen up to 24 hours in some individuals. Tropicamide hinders accommodation by causing the contraction of the ciliary muscle. The cycloplegic effect occurs within 20 to minutes following administration, with a duration of action of four to 10 hours. Tropicamide can elevate intraocular pressure.[A229958] The ophthalmic use of tropicamide is not typically associated with serious systemic adverse events.[A230173]    One randomized pilot study showed that oral tropicamide alleviated perceived symptoms of sialorrhea in patients with Parkinson's Disease: anticholinergics are believed to restore the dopaminergic to cholinergic activity imbalance in neurodegenerative diseases.[A229958] Similarly in one case report, tropicamide administered via ophthalmic solution relieved clozapine-induced sialorrhea.[A230093] Interestingly, in rodent models, tropicamide suppressed drug-induced tremulous jaw movements which are often used as a model of parkinsonian tremor: the significance of this finding requires further investigations.[A5677]Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are involved in numerous ocular functions. The M3 subtype is predominantly expressed by smooth muscle cells of the sphincter pupillae, which is a circular muscle of the iris, and ciliary muscles. In response to light or binding of acetylcholine, M3 receptor signalling leads to contraction of the sphincter pupillae and pupil constriction. Contraction of the ciliary muscle via M3receptor signalling also leads to accommodation, adjusting the lens for near vision.[A230178] The eye is also innervated by parasympathetic nerves: ciliary ganglion neurons project to the ciliary body and the sphincter pupillae muscle of the iris to control ocular accommodation and pupil constriction.[A230183]     Tropicamide is a non-selective muscarinic antagonist that binds to all subtypes of muscarinic receptors. By binding to muscarinic receptors, tropicamide relaxes the pupillary sphincter muscle and causes pupil dilation.[A229958] By blocking the muscarinic receptors of the ciliary body, tropicamide also prevents accommodation.[A230178] Like other muscarinic antagonists, tropicamide inhibits the parasympathetic drive, allowing the sympathetic nervous system responses to dominate.[A229958] Tropicamide is thought to ameliorate sialorrhea by blocking M4 receptors expressed on salivary glands and reducing hypersalivation.[A229958]"
506,"For use as an adjunct in the therapy of all forms of parkinsonism and control of extrapyramidal disorders secondary to neuroleptic drug therapy.A muscarinic antagonist that has effects in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. It has been used in the treatment of arteriosclerotic, idiopathic, and postencephalitic parkinsonism. It has also been used to alleviate extrapyramidal symptoms induced by phenothiazine derivatives and reserpine.Biperiden is a weak peripheral anticholinergic agent. It has, therefore, some antisecretory, antispasmodic and mydriatic effects. In addition, biperiden possesses nicotinolytic activity. The parenteral form of biperiden is an effective and reliable agent for the treatment of acute episodes of extrapyramidal disturbances sometimes seen during treatment with neuroleptic agents. Akathisia, akinesia, dyskinetic tremors, rigor, oculogyric crisis, spasmodic torticollis, and profuse sweating are markedly reduced or eliminated. With parenteral biperiden, these drug-induced disturbances are rapidly brought under control.Parkinsonism is thought to result from an imbalance between the excitatory (cholinergic) and inhibitory (dopaminergic) systems in the corpus striatum. The mechanism of action of centrally active anticholinergic drugs such as biperiden is considered to relate to competitive antagonism of acetylcholine at cholinergic receptors in the corpus striatum, which then restores the balance."
507,"Typically added to improve SVR and reduce relapse rates [A19644].    The addition of ribavirin in Technivie therapy indicated for treating HCV genotype 1a and 4 infections is recommended in patients with or without cirrhosis.     Resistance: viral genetic determinants resulting in variable response to ribavirin therapy has not been yet determined. Producing a broad-spectrum activity against several RNA and DNA viruses, Ribavirin is a synthetic guanosine nucleoside and antiviral agent that interferes with the synthesis of viral mRNA. It is primarily indicated for use in treating hepatitis C and viral hemorrhagic fevers. HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. It is reported that ribavirin might be only effective in early stages of viral hemorrhagic fevers including Lasser fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever, and Hantavirus infection. Ribavirin is a prodrug that is metabolized into nucleoside analogs that blocks viral RNA synthesis and viral mRNA capping. Before the development of newer drugs, ribavirin and [DB00008]/[DB00022] dual therapy was considered the first-generation and standard antiviral treatment [A19626]. The dual therapy was administered for 48 weeks in patients with genotype 1, 4, 5, and 6, and 24 weeks in patients with genotype 2 and 3 [A19626]. Newer drugs developed as Hepatitis C viral infection treatments can be used to reduce or eliminate the use of ribavirin, which are associated with serious adverse effects. They also improve therapeutic efficacy in patients with failed [DB00008]/[DB00022] and ribavirin-based therapy. The potential use of ribavirin as a treatment for acute myeloid leukemia is currently under investigation.    According to 2017 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and 2015 consensus guidelines from the Canadian Association for the Study of the Liver (CASL), ribavirin is typically used as an adjunct therapy to various first-line and second-line combination therapies recommended for each genotypes. Ribavirin is added to decrease relapse rates by accelerating viral clearance early in the treatment course [A19645]. Additionally, including ribavirin in the regimen can increase the risk of anemia. Addition of weight-based ribavirin to Technivie therapy increased sustained virologic response after 12 weeks of daily therapy (SVR12) from 90% to 97% in patients with HCV genotype 1a and 90.9% to 100% in HCV genotype 4 patients [L852]. Zepatier therapy along with ribavirin improved SVR in HCV genotype 5 patients. The inclusion of ribavirin in the combination therapies depend on individual patient's profile, for example if HCV genotype 3 patient has a Y93H genetic variant and compensated cirrhosis.Ribavirin mediates direct antiviral activity against a number of DNA and RNA viruses by increasing the mutation frequency in the genomes of several RNA viruses. It is a member of the nucleoside antimetabolite drugs that interfere with duplication of the viral genetic material. The drug inhibits the activity of the enzyme RNA dependent RNA polymerase, due to its resemblence to building blocks of the RNA molecules. Ribavirin is reported to have several mechanism of actions that lead to inhibition of viral RNA and protein synthesis.   After activation by adenosine kinase to ribavirin mono-, di-, and triphosphate metabolites. Ribavirin triphosphate (RTP) is the predominant metabolite which directly inhibits viral mRNA polymerase by binding to the nucleotide binding site of the enzyme. This prevents the binding of the correct nucleotides, leading to a reduction in viral replication or to the production of defective virions [A19645]. RTP also demonstrates an inhibitory action on viral mRNA guanylyltransferase and mRNA 2′-O-methyltransferase of dengue virus. Inhibition of these enzymes disrupts the posttranslational capping of the 5′ end of viral mRNA through ribavirin being incorporated at the 5′ end in place of guanosine and preventing the cap methylation step.     Inhibition of host inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) and subsequent depletion of GTP pool is proposed to be another mechanism of action of ribavirin. IMPDH catalyzes the rate-limiting step where inosine 5′-monophosphate is converted to xanthine monophosphate during guanosine monophosphate (GMP) synthesis. GMP is later converted to guanosine triphoshpate (GTP). Ribavirin monophosphate mimics inosine 5′-monophosphate and acts as a competitive inhibitor of IMPDH. Inhibited de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides and decreased intracellular GTP pools leads to a decline in viral protein synthesis and limit replication of viral genomes [A19645].    Ribavirin acts as a mutagen in the target virus to cause an 'error catastrophe' due to increased viral mutations. RTP pairs with cytidine triphosphate or uridine triphosphate with equal efficiency and to block HCV RNA elongation. It causes premature termination of nascent HCV RNA and increases mutagenesis by producing defective virions [A19645].    Ribavirin also exerts an immunomodulatory action of the host to the virus by shifting a Th2 response in favor of a Th1 phenotype. Th2 response and production of type 2 cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 stimulates the humoral response which enhances immunity toward the virus [A19645]. Ribavirin enhanced induction of interferon-related genes, including the interferon-α receptor, and down-regulation of genes involved in interferon inhibition, apoptosis, and hepatic stellate cell activation in vitro [A19644]. "
508,"For the treatment of backache and ankylosing spondylitisA drug that has anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic activities. It is especially effective in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis. It also is useful in rheumatoid arthritis and Reiter&#39;s syndrome (investigational indication). Although phenylbutazone is effective in gouty arthritis, risk/benefit considerations indicate that this drug should not be employed for this disease. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1994, p1822)Phenylbutazone is a synthetic, pyrazolone derivative. It is a nonhormonal anti-inflammatory, antipyretic compound useful in the management of inflammatory conditions. The apparent analgesic effect is probably related mainly to the compound's anti-inflammatory properties and arise from its ability to reduce production of prostaglandin H and prostacyclin. Prostaglandins act on a variety of cells such as vascular smooth muscle cells causing constriction or dilation, on platelets causing aggregation or disaggregation and on spinal neurons causing pain. Prostacylcin causes vascular constriction platelet disaggregationPhenylbutazone binds to and inactivates prostaglandin H synthase and prostacyclin synthase through peroxide (H2O2) mediated deactivation. The reduced production of prostaglandin leads to reduced inflammation of the surrounding tissues."
509,"Fentanyl intravenous or intramuscular injections are indicated for short term analgesia during induction, maintenance, and recovery from general or regional anesthesia.[Label] These injections are also used with a neuroleptic for premedication, induction, and as an adjunct to maintenance of anesthesia.[Label] Finally, fentanyl intravenous or intramuscular injections are used with oxygen for anesthesia in high risk patients.[Label]    Fentanyl sublingual tablets, transmucosal lozenges, buccal tablets, sublingual sprays, transdermal systems, and nasal sprays are indicated for the management of breakthrough pain in opioid tolerant cancer patients who require around the clock pain management.[L6598,L6601,L6604,L6607,L922,L6610]Fentanyl, a potent opioid agonist, was developed in the 1950s to fill a need for strong and rapid analgesia.[A179542] Because of these characteristics, fentanyl is commonly used to treat chronic cancer pain or in anesthesia.[Label,L6598,L6601,L6604,L6607,L922,L6610,L6613] Fentanyl is related to other opioids like [morphine] and [oxycodone].    Fentanyl's high potency has also made it a common adulterant in illicit drugs, especially heroin.[A179542] In 2017, 47600 overdose deaths in the United States involved some opioid (over 2/3 of all overdose deaths).[L6748] Opioid overdoses kill an average of 11 Canadians daily.[L6751]    Fentanyl was FDA approved in 1968.[Label,L6598,L6601,L6604,L6607,L922,L6610,L6613]Fentanyl produces strong analgesia through its activation of opioid receptors.[Label,A179533] It has a duration of action of several hours and a wider therapeutic index as patients develop tolerance to opioids.[Label] Fentanyl is associated with a risk of addiction and abuse and should not be mixed with alcohol or benzodiazepines.[Label,L6598,L6601,L6604,L6607,L922,L6610,L6613]Fentanyl binds to opioid receptors, especially the mu opioid receptor, which are coupled to G-proteins.[A179533] Activation of opioid receptors causes GTP to be exchanged for GDP on the G-proteins which in turn down regulates adenylate cyclase, reducing concentrations of cAMP.[A179533] Reduced cAMP decreases cAMP dependant influx of calcium ions into the cell.[A179533] The exchange of GTP for GDP results in hyperpolarization of the cell and inhibition of nerve activity.[A179533]"
510,"Meloxicam is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of arthritis and osteoarthritis.  In addition, it is indicated for the pauciarticular and polyarticular course of Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis (JRA) in patients aged 2 years old or above.[L11398] Off-label uses include the treatment of dental or post-surgical pain. In addition to the above, meloxicam has also been studied in the treatment of neuropathic pain.[L34100]Meloxicam is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve various types of pain, including pain caused by musculoskeletal conditions, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis.[A190189] With a longer half-life than most other NSAIDS, it is a favorable option for those who require once-daily dosing. Meloxicam is available in oral, transdermal, and intravenous formulations. It is a preferential COX-2 inhibitor, purportedly reducing the risk of adverse gastrointestinal tract effects, however, this is a topic of controversy.[A190198,A190201]Meloxicam is an anti-inflammatory, analgesic analgesic with antipyretic effects in fever.[A190189] Prostaglandins are substances that contribute to inflammation.[A176366] This drug also exerts preferential actions against COX-2[A190195], which may reduce the possible gastrointestinal effects of this drug.      In humans, meloxicam has demonstrated the ability to decrease erythrocyte sedimentation rate(ESR) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and to decrease ESR, C-reactive protein (CRP), as well as  aquaporin-1 expression.[A190189] As with other NSAIDS, prolonged use of meloxicum can result in renal or cardiovascular impairment or thrombotic cardiovascular events.[L11398]    A note on gastrointestinal effects    As meloxicam preferentially inhibits COX-2, it is thought to cause less gastrointestinal irritation compared to other NSAIDS. Despite this, it still carries a risk of gastric inflammation, bleeding and ulceration.[A190201,L11398]   In one study, patients on meloxicam suffered from gastrointestinal symptoms at a rate of 13% compared to 19% of those on [diclofenac]. GI events were found to be less severe in the meloxicam-treated patients.[A190189]Meloxicam inhibits prostaglandin synthetase (cylooxygenase 1 and 2) enzymes leading to a decreased synthesis of prostaglandins, which normally mediate painful inflammatory symptoms.[A176366] As prostaglandins sensitize neuronal pain receptors, inhibition of their synthesis leads to analgesic and inflammatory effects. Meloxicam preferentially inhibits COX-2, but also exerts some activity against COX-1, causing gastrointestinal irritation.[A190189,L11398]"
511,"For the treatment of bronchospasm, chronic bronchitis, asthma, and emphysema.A beta-adrenergic agonist used in the treatment of asthma and bronchospasms. [PubChem]Orciprenaline (also known as metaproterenol), a synthetic amine, is structurally and pharmacologically similar to isoproterenol. Orciprenaline is used exclusively as a bronchodilator. The pharmacological effects of beta adrenergic agonist drugs, such as orciprenaline, are at least in part attributable to stimulation through beta adrenergic receptors of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic- 3',5'- adenosine monophosphate (c-AMP). Increased cAMP levels lead to relaxation of bronchial smooth muscles and inhibition of the release of inalammatory mediators from mast cells that are involved in promoting immediate hypersensitivity .Orciprenaline stimulates the β2-adrenergic receptor expressed in the lungs, uterus, and vasculature supplying skeletal muscles by acting as a moderately selective agonist. It exerts minimal or no effect on alpha-adrenergic receptors. Intracellularly, the actions of orciprenaline are mediated by cAMP, the production of which is augmented by beta stimulation. The drug is believed to work by activating adenylate cyclase, the enzyme responsible for producing the cellular mediator cAMP."
512,"For the treatment of bacterial infection of respiratory tract, urinary tract, GI, CNS and immuno compromised patients.Rosoxacin is a quinolone derivative antibiotic for the treatment of bacterial infection of respiratory tract, urinary tract, GI, CNS and immuno compromised patients. Rosoxacin is known to be effective against penicillin resistant strains and is a single dose orally administered drug, which avoids all complications of parenteral administration seen with penicillin, especially anaphylactic shock.Rosoxacin is a nonfluorinated quinolone antibiotic. Its mode of action depends on blocking of bacterial DNA replication by binding itself to an enzyme called DNA gyrase, which allows the untwisting required to replicate one DNA double helix into two. Rosoxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.Rosoxacin binds to and inhibits the enzymes topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV, which are required for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination."
513,"Used for induction and/or maintenance of anaesthesia and for management of refractory status epilepticus. Propofol is an intravenous anaesthetic agent used for induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia. IV administration of propfol is used to induce unconsciousness after which anaesthesia may be maintained using a combination of medications. Recovery from propofol-induced anaesthesia is generally rapid and associated with less frequent side effects (e.g. drowsiness, nausea, vomiting) than with thiopental, methohexital, and etomidate. Propofol may be used prior to diagnostic procedures requiring anaesthesia, in the management of refractory status epilepticus, and for induction and/or maintenance of anaesthesia prior to and during surgeries.Propofol is a sedative-hypnotic agent for use in the induction and maintenance of anesthesia or sedation. Intravenous injection of a therapeutic dose of propofol produces hypnosis rapidly with minimal excitation, usually within 40 seconds from the start of an injection (the time for one arm-brain circulation).The action of propofol involves a positive modulation of the inhibitory function of the neurotransmitter gama-aminobutyric acid (GABA) through GABA-A receptors."
514,"For adjunctive treatment of: edema due to congestive heart failure; drug-induced edema; centrencephalic epilepsies; chronic simple (open-angle) glaucomaOne of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitors that is sometimes effective against absence seizures. It is sometimes useful also as an adjunct in the treatment of tonic-clonic, myoclonic, and atonic seizures, particularly in women whose seizures occur or are exacerbated at specific times in the menstrual cycle. However, its usefulness is transient often because of rapid development of tolerance. Its antiepileptic effect may be due to its inhibitory effect on brain carbonic anhydrase, which leads to an increased transneuronal chloride gradient, increased chloride current, and increased inhibition. (From Smith and Reynard, Textbook of Pharmacology, 1991, p337)Acetazolamide is a potent carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, effective in the control of fluid secretion, in the treatment of certain convulsive disorders and in the promotion of diuresis in instances of abnormal fluid retention. Acetazolamide is not a mercurial diuretic. Rather, it is a nonbacteriostatic sulfonamide possessing a chemical structure and pharmacological activity distinctly different from the bacteriostatic sulfonamides.The anticonvulsant activity of Acetazolamide may depend on a direct inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the CNS, which decreases carbon dioxide tension in the pulmonary alveoli, thus increasing arterial oxygen tension. The diuretic effect depends on the inhibition of carbonic anhydrase, causing a reduction in the availability of hydrogen ions for active transport in the renal tubule lumen. This leads to alkaline urine and an increase in the excretion of bicarbonate, sodium, potassium, and water."
515,"[L39100,L39105]Tadalafil is a selective phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor that is used in the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED), pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and benign prostatic hypertrophy.[L39100, L39105] It was first approved in 2003 by the FDA for use in ED and later in 2009 for PAH. In contrast to other PDE5 inhibitors like [sildenafil], tadalafil has greater selectivity for PDE5 and a longer half-life which has made it a more suitable option for chronic once-daily dosing in the treatment of PAH.[A242287]Tadalafil exerts a therapeutic effect in ED by increasing sexual stimulation-dependant smooth muscle relaxation in the penis, allowing the corpus cavernosum to fill with blood to produce an erection.[A242287, A242377] Smooth muscle relaxation in the pulmonary vasculature helps to produce vasodilation in PAH which reduces blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries.[A242377] In BPH, tadalafil may contribute to decreased smooth muscle cell proliferation which may reduce the size of the prostate and relieve the anatomical obstruction which produces urinary symptoms of BPH.[A242382] The decreased affinity of tadalafil for PDE6 compared to other PDE5 inhibitors may explain the reduced incidence of visual side effects.[L39100, L39105, A242287]Tadalafil is a selective phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor that produces several downstream effects with the most common therapeutic effect being smooth muscle relaxation. [L39095] Patients may experience ED due to a variety of causes including psychogenic, neurogenic, vasculogenic, iatrogenic, or endocrine. [A242392] These causes result in dysfunction of penile smooth muscle relaxation through either disrupted neuronal signaling or direct influence on smooth muscle cells. During sexual arousal, non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) neurons release nitric oxide (NO). Nitric oxide stimulates guanylate cyclase which converts guanosine triphosphate to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).[A242287, A242377] cGMP activates the cGMP-dependent kinase (PKG) in a signal cascade which activates K+ channels leading to inhibition of Ca2+ channels, inhibits platelet activation, and inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation while inducing apoptosis. This signal cascade is attenuated by PDE5 which breaks the phosphodiester bond of cGMP, converting it to GMP. Inhibition of PDE5 by tadalafil increases signaling via the PKG cascade which supports penile smooth muscle relaxation during sexual arousal by decreasing Ca2+ entry into smooth muscle cells. This smooth muscle relaxation allows blood to fill the corpus cavernosum thereby producing an erection.    In PAH, blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries is raised due to a variety of mechanisms stemming from endothelial dysfunction.[A242377] Decreased production of NO and prostacyclin reduce vasodilatory signaling while overproduction of endothelin-1 and thromboxane increase vasoconstriction. Inflammation, thromboses, and hypoxia later contribute to vascular remodeling which further reduces luminal size. The resultant increase in blood pressure reduces the capacity for gas exchange and increases afterload at the right ventricle, producing symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, and dizziness as well as leading to right-sided heart failure. Tadalafil exerts its therapeutic effect in PAH through boosting NO-cGMP signaling to contribute to smooth muscle relaxation as with ED.    Lastly, tadalafil is used to treat BPH.[L39095] BPH produces urinary dysfunction through hyperproliferation of the epithelial and smooth muscle layers of the prostate.[A242382] The increased size of the prostate blocks urine flow through the urethra resulting in higher residual volumes due to incomplete emptying. Tadalafil does not appear to exert its benefit via smooth muscle relaxation of the prostate. It may instead exert its effect through a mix of increased oxygenation and decreased inflammation, which decreases tissue remodeling, and inhibition of cell proliferation through the cGMP cascade.    The decreased affinity for PDE6 compared to other PDE5 inhibitors may explain the decreased incidence of visual side effects as PDE6 is present in the eye and contributes to color vision.[L39100, L39105, A242287]"
516,"For the treatment and management of chronic alcoholismA carbamate derivative used as an alcohol deterrent. It is a relatively nontoxic substance when administered alone, but markedly alters the intermediary metabolism of alcohol. When alcohol is ingested after administration of disulfiram, blood acetaldehyde concentrations are increased, followed by flushing, systemic vasodilation, respiratory difficulties, nausea, hypotension, and other symptoms (acetaldehyde syndrome). It acts by inhibiting aldehyde dehydrogenase.Disulfiram produces a sensitivity to alcohol which results in a highly unpleasant reaction when the patient under treatment ingests even small amounts of alcohol. Disulfiram blocks the oxidation of alcohol at the acetaldehyde stage during alcohol metabolism following disulfiram intake, the concentration of acetaldehyde occurring in the blood may be 5 to 10 times higher than that found during metabolism of the same amount of alcohol alone. Accumulation of acetaldehyde in the blood produces a complex of highly unpleasant symptoms referred to hereinafter as the disulfiram-alcohol reaction. This reaction, which is proportional to the dosage of both disulfiram and alcohol, will persist as long as alcohol is being metabolized. Disulfiram does not appear to influence the rate of alcohol elimination from the body. Prolonged administration of disulfiram does not produce tolerance; the longer a patient remains on therapy, the more exquisitely sensitive he becomes to alcohol.Disulfiram blocks the oxidation of alcohol at the acetaldehyde stage during alcohol metabolism following disulfiram intake causing an accumulation of acetaldehyde in the blood producing highly unpleasant symptoms. Disulfiram blocks the oxidation of alcohol through its irreversible inactivation of aldehyde dehydrogenase, which acts in the second step of ethanol utilization. In addition, disulfiram competitively binds and inhibits the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, which may indicate some value in the treatment of the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, however this activity has not been extensively studied."
517,"For the prevention of pregnancy in women who elect to use this product as a method of contraception.A synthetic progestational hormone used alone or in combination with estrogens as an oral contraceptive. Although etynodiol or ethynodiol are sometimes used as a synonym for ethynodiol diacetate, what is usually being referred to is actually ethynodiol diacetate and not ethynodiol (which is a separate drug that has never been marketed, see [DB13866]).Ethynodiol Diacetate is used as a female contraceptive. Ethynodiol Diacetate is a progestin or a synthetic form of the naturally occurring female sex hormone, progesterone. In a woman's normal menstrual cycle, an egg matures and is released from the ovaries (ovulation). The ovary then produces progesterone, preventing the release of further eggs and priming the lining of the womb for a possible pregnancy. If pregnancy occurs, progesterone levels in the body remain high, maintaining the womb lining. If pregnancy does not occur, progesterone levels in the body fall, resulting in a menstrual period. Ethynodiol Diacetate tricks the body processes into thinking that ovulation has already occurred, by maintaining high levels of the synthetic progesterone. This prevents the release of eggs from the ovaries.Binds to the progesterone and estrogen receptors. Target cells include the female reproductive tract, the mammary gland, the hypothalamus, and the pituitary. Once bound to the receptor, progestins like Ethynodiol Diacetate will slow the frequency of release of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus and blunt the pre-ovulatory LH (luteinizing hormone) surge."
518,"Used in the management of symptoms of asthma. Also used in the treatment of peripheral vascular diseases and in the management of cerebrovascular insufficiency, sickle cell disease, and diabetic neuropathy.Enprofylline is a derivative of theophylline which shares bronchodilator properties. Enprofylline is used in asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and in the management of cerebrovascular insufficiency, sickle cell disease, and diabetic neuropathy. Long-term enprofylline administration may be associated with elevation in liver enzyme levels and unpredictable blood levels.Enprofylline is a synthetic dimethylxanthine derivative structurally related to theophylline and caffeine. It antagonizes erythrocyte phosphodiesterase, increasing cAMP activity.Enprofylline inhibits erythrocyte phosphodiesterase, resulting in an increase in erythrocyte cAMP activity. Subsequently, the erythrocyte membrane becomes more resistant to deformity. Along with erythrocyte activity, enprofylline also decreases blood viscosity by reducing plasma fibrinogen concentrations and increasing fibrinolytic activity."
519,"For the treatment of initial and recurrent urinary tract infections in adults caused by the following susceptible microorganisms: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiella species (including K. pneumoniae), and Enterobacter species.Synthetic antimicrobial related to oxolinic acid and nalidixic acid and used in urinary tract infections.Cinoxacin is a synthetic antibacterial agent with in vitro activity against many gram-negative aerobic bacteria, particularly strains of the Enterobacteriaceae family. Cinoxacin inhibits bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis, is bactericidal, and is active over the entire urinary pH range. Cross resistance with nalidixic acid has been demonstrated.Evidence exists that cinoxacin binds strongly, but reversibly, to DNA, interfering with synthesis of RNA and, consequently, with protein synthesis. It appears to also inhibit DNA gyrase. This enzyme is necessary for proper replicated DNA separation. By inhibiting this enzyme, DNA replication and cell division is inhibited."
520,"Fosfomycin is indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated cases of cystitis caused by susceptible strains of _Escherichia coli_ and _Enterococcus faecalis_.[L31818] Fosfomycin is not officially indicated for the treatment of pyelonephritis or perinephric abscess, although there have been reported cases of off-label usage in these situations.[L31818]Fosfomycin was discovered in 1969 by scientists at the Spanish Penicillin and Antibiotics Company and is produced by _Streptomyces fradiae_.[A229338,A230348] It may also be produced synthetically and is commercially available as the disodium salt for intravenous administration and as the calcium or trometamol salt for oral administration.[A230348] In terms of chemical structure, fosfomycin is a phosphoenolpyruvate analog and contains a phosphonic group and an epoxide ring.[A230348]    Due to its ease of administration as a single 3-gram oral dose and desirable safety profile, fosfomycin has largely become a first-line therapeutic option for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) in females.[A230378] Despite being FDA approved only for urinary tract infections, fosfomycin actually has a broad spectrum of activity and is active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.[A230348] As such there is great interest in exploring the usefulness of fosfomycin for indications beyond the treatment of UTIs.[A230353,A230358]Although used primarily to treat urinary tract infections, fosfomycin has been shown to act synergistically with other antibiotics against clinically relevant bacteria.[A229338] There is also growing interest in the potential of fosfomycin to treat more complex infections since it has retained activity against many difficult-to-treat strains of bacteria including methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant enterobacteria.[A230358] Further, since fosfomycin has a unique and singular mechanism of action, the risk of cross-resistance with other antibiotics is low.[A230353,A230348]    Fosfomycin also demonstrates immunomodulating properties. For example, the antibiotic may influence components of the acute inflammatory cytokine response and enhances neutrophil phagocytic destruction of pathogens.[A229338,A230343]    Fosfomycin penetrates biofilms effectively and is capable of not only reducing or eliminating microorganisms in biofilms but can also alter the biofilm structure.[A229338,A230358]Fosfomycin exerts its bactericidal effects by binding covalently to a cysteine in the active site of the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase (MurA) enzyme, rendering it inactive. By preventing MurA from catalyzing the condensation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) with UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UNAG), fosfomycin inhibits the production of the peptidoglycan precursor UDP N-acetylmuramic acid (UDP-MurNAc).[A229338,L31818] Ultimately, the first step of bacterial cell wall synthesis is disrupted.[A230348]    In _Escherichia coli_, fosfomycin gains entry into bacterial cells via two mechanisms: the L-alpha-glycerophosphate system and the hexose-6-phosphate transporter system.[A229338]    Fosfomycin also has important effects on cell adhesion. For example, the adhesion of bacterial cells to urinary epithelial cells is reduced in the presence of fosfomycin. The adhesion of _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ and _Haemophilus influenzae_ to respiratory epithelial cells is also reduced[A229338]"
521,"In general, diazepam is useful in the symptomatic management of mild to moderate degrees of anxiety in conditions dominated by tension, excitation, agitation, fear, or aggressiveness such as may occur in psychoneurosis, anxiety reactions due to stress conditions, and anxiety states with somatic expression.[F3160]    Moreover, in acute alcoholic withdrawal, diazepam may be useful in the symptomatic relief of acute agitation, tremor, and impending acute delirium tremens.[F3160]    Furthermore, diazepam is a useful adjunct for the relief of skeletal muscle spasm due to reflex spasm to local pathologies, such as inflammation of the muscle and joints or secondary to trauma; spasticity caused by upper motor neuron disorders, such as cerebral palsy and paraplegia; athetosis and the rare ""stiff man syndrome"".[F3160]    Particular label information from the United Kingdom also lists particular age-specific indications, including for adults: (1) The short-term relief (2-4 weeks) only, of anxiety which is severe, disabling, or subjecting the individual to unacceptable distress, occurring alone or in association with insomnia or short-term psychosomatic, organic or psychotic illness, (2) cerebral palsy, (3) muscle spasm, (4) as an adjunct to certain types of epilepsy (eg. myoclonus), (5) symptomatic treatment of acute alcohol withdrawal, (6) as oral premedication for the nervous dental patient, and (7) for premedication before surgery.[L5188]    In the same UK label information, diazepam is indicated in children for: (1) control of tension and irritability in cerebral spasticity in selected cases, (2) as an adjunct to the control of muscle spasm in tetanus, and for (3) oral premedication.[L5188]    A diazepam nasal spray is indicated in patients 6 years and older to treat intermittent, stereotypic episodes of frequent seizure activity that are different than the patient's usual seizure pattern.[L11247]A benzodiazepine with anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, sedative, muscle relaxant, and amnesic properties and a long duration of action. Its actions are mediated by enhancement of gamma-aminobutyric acid activity. It is used in the treatment of severe anxiety disorders, as a hypnotic in the short-term management of insomnia, as a sedative and premedicant, as an anticonvulsant, and in the management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p589)    Given diazepam's storied history as a commonly used and effective medication for a variety of indications, contemporary advancements in the formulation and administration of the agent include the development and US FDA approval of an auto-injectable formulation for the rapid treatment of uncontrolled seizures in 2015-2016 [L5200]. Combining diazepam, a proven effective therapy for acute repetitive seizures, with an auto-injector designed for subcutaneous administration that is quickly and easily administered offers the potential for complete, consistent drug absorption and rapid onset of effect [L5200]. This current development is subsequently an important addition to the rescue therapy tool chest for patients with epilepsy [L5200].Diazepam is a benzodiazepine that exerts anxiolytic, sedative, muscle- relaxant, anticonvulsant and amnestic effects [F3157, F3160, L5188]. Most of these effects are thought to result from facilitation of the action of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system [F3157, F3160, L5188].Diazepam is a benzodiazepine tranquilliser with anticonvulsant, sedative, muscle relaxant and amnesic properties [F3157, F3160, L5188].    Benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, bind to receptors in various regions of the brain and spinal cord. This binding increases the inhibitory effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) [F3157, F3160, L5188]. GABAs functions include CNS involvement in sleep induction. Also involved in the control of hypnosis, memory, anxiety, epilepsy and neuronal excitability [F3157, F3160, L5188]."
522,"For the treatment of anxiety disorders, depressive symptoms secondary to anxiety and agitation.A phenothiazine with actions similar to chlorpromazine. It is used as an antipsychotic and an antiemetic.Trifluoperazine is a trifluoro-methyl phenothiazine derivative intended for the management of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Trifluoperazine has not been shown effective in the management of behaviorial complications in patients with mental retardation.Trifluoperazine blocks postsynaptic mesolimbic dopaminergic D1 and D2 receptors in the brain; depresses the release of hypothalamic and hypophyseal hormones and is believed to depress the reticular activating system thus affecting basal metabolism, body temperature, wakefulness, vasomotor tone, and emesis."
523,"For the treatment of epilepsy.Phensuximide is a member of the succinimide class with anticonvulsant properties. It suppresses the paroxysmal three cycle per second spike and wave EEG pattern associated with lapses of consciousness in petit mal seizures. The frequency of attacks is reduced by depression of nerve transmission in the motor cortex.Phensuximide suppresses the paroxysmal three cycle per second spike and wave EEG pattern associated with lapses of consciousness in absence (petit mal) seizures. The frequency of attacks is reduced by depression of nerve transmission in the motor cortex.Phensuximide's mechanism of action not understood, but may act in inhibitory neuronal systems that are important in the generation of the three per second rhythm. It's effects may be related to its ability to inhibit depolarization-induced accumulation of cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP in brain tissue."
524,"For the treatment of certain infections caused by bacteria such as pneumonia and ear, lung, skin, throat, and urinary tract infections.Semisynthetic, broad-spectrum antibiotic derivative of cephalexin.Cefaclor is a second generation cephalosporin antibiotic with a spectrum resembling first-generation cephalosporins. In vitro tests demonstrate that the bactericidal action of the cephalosporins results from inhibition of cell-wall synthesis. As indicated by _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ clinical studies, cefaclor was shown to be effective against most strains of Gram positive aerobes - Staphylococci (including coagulase-positive, coagulase-negative, and penicillinase-producing strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes (group A &szlig;-hemolytic streptococci), as well as Gram-negative aerobes - Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae (including &szlig;-lactamase-producing ampicillin-resistant strains), Klebsiella sp, and Proteus mirabilis.Cefaclor, like the penicillins, is a beta-lactam antibiotic. By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, it inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins. It is possible that cefaclor interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."
525,"For the medical termination of intrauterine pregnancy through 49 days' pregnancy. Also indicated to control hyperglycemia secondary to hypercortisolism in adult patients with endogenous Cushing's syndrome who have type 2 diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance and are not candidates for surgery or have had unsuccessful surgery.Mifepristone is a progestational and glucocorticoid hormone antagonist. Its inhibition of progesterone induces bleeding during the luteal phase and in early pregnancy by releasing endogenous prostaglandins from the endometrium or decidua. As a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, the drug has been used to treat hypercortisolism in patients with nonpituitary cushing syndrome. The two marketed forms of mifepristone are Mifeprex® (mifepristone 200mg) and Korlym™ (mifepristone 300mg). Currently under investigation for use in psychotic depression (phase 3 trials).Mifepristone is a synthetic steroid with antiprogestational effects indicated for the medical termination of intrauterine pregnancy through 49 days' pregnancy. Doses of 1 mg/kg or greater of mifepristone have been shown to antagonize the endometrial and myometrial effects of progesterone in women. During pregnancy, the compound sensitizes the myometrium to the contraction-inducing activity of prostaglandins. Mifepristone also exhibits antiglucocorticoid and weak antiandrogenic activity. The activity of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone in rats was inhibited following doses of 10 to 25 mg/kg of mifepristone. Doses of 4.5 mg/kg or greater in human beings resulted in a compensatory elevation of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol.The anti-progestational activity of mifepristone results from competitive interaction with progesterone at progesterone-receptor sites. Based on studies with various oral doses in several animal species (mouse, rat, rabbit and monkey), the compound inhibits the activity of endogenous or exogenous progesterone. The termination of pregnancy results.    In the treatment of Cushing's syndrome, Mifepristone blocks the binding of cortisol to its receptor. It does not decrease cortisol production but reduces the effects of excess cortisol, such as high blood sugar levels."
526,"For the treatment of the symptoms of the common cold and allergic rhinitis, such as runny nose, itchy eyes, watery eyes, and sneezing.Histamine H1 antagonist used in treatment of allergies, rhinitis, and urticaria.Brompheniramine is an antihistaminergic medication of the propylamine class. It is a first-generation antihistamine. In allergic reactions an allergen interacts with and cross-links surface IgE antibodies on mast cells and basophils. Once the mast cell-antibody-antigen complex is formed, a complex series of events occurs that eventually leads to cell-degranulation and the release of histamine (and other chemical mediators) from the mast cell or basophil. Once released, histamine can react with local or widespread tissues through histamine receptors. Histamine, acting on H1-receptors, produces pruritis, vasodilatation, hypotension, flushing, headache, tachycardia, and bronchoconstriction. Histamine also increases vascular permeability and potentiates pain. Brompheniramine is a histamine H1 antagonist (or more correctly, an inverse histamine agonist) of the alkylamine class. It provides effective, temporary relief of sneezing, watery and itchy eyes, and runny nose due to hay fever and other upper respiratory allergies.Brompheniramine is an antagonist of the H1 histamine receptors with moderate antimuscarinic actions, as with other common antihistamines such as diphenhydramine. Due to its anticholindergic effects, brompheniramine may cause drowsiness, sedation, dry mouth, dry throat, blurred vision, and increased heart rate."
527,"Loperamide is indicated for the relief of diarrhea, including Travelers’ Diarrhea.[L42785] As an off-label use, it is often used to manage chemotherapy-related diarrhea.[A251610]Loperamide is an anti-diarrheal agent that is available as various over-the-counter products for treating diarrhea.[L42785] The drug was first synthesized in 1969 and used medically in 1976.[A251610] It is a highly lipophilic synthetic phenylpiperidine opioid [A251610] that is structurally similar to opiate receptor agonists such as [diphenoxylate] and [haloperidol].[A6249] Due to pharmacological properties, loperamide has been misused and abused to self-manage opioid withdrawal symptoms and to induce euphoria.[A251610, A251625] However, loperamide is associated with a risk for experiencing a range of adverse effects, often life-threatening, if taking for non-therapeutic reasons or at doses higher than the recommended dose.[L42790]Loperamide is an anti-diarrheal agent that provides symptomatic relief of diarrhea.[L42790] It decreases peristalsis and fluid secretion in the gastrointestinal tract, delays colonic transit time, and increases the absorption of fluids and electrolytes from the gastrointestinal tract.[A6249, A251610, A251630] Loperamide also increases rectal tone,[A251610] reduces daily fecal volume, and increases the viscosity and bulk density of feces.[L42790] It also increases the tone of the anal sphincter, thereby reducing incontinence and urgency.[A251615, L42790] The onset of action is about one hour and the duration of action can be up to three days.[A251615]    While loperamide is a potent mu-opioid receptor agonist,[A251615] it does not mediate significant analgesic activity at therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses.[A6249, A251615] However, at high doses of loperamide, inhibition of P-glycoprotein-mediated drug efflux may allow loperamide to cross the blood-brain barrier, where loperamide can exert central opioid effects and toxicity.[A251610]    At very high plasma concentrations, loperamide can interfere with cardiac conduction.[A251625] Because loperamide inhibits the Na+-gated cardiac channels [A251610] and ether-a-go-go–related gene potassium channels,[A251625] the drug can prolong the QRS complex and the QTc interval, which can lead to ventricular dysrhythmias, monomorphic and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, torsade de pointes, ventricular fibrillation, Brugada syndrome, cardiac arrest, and death.[A251610]Enteric neurons synthesize and release endogenous opioid peptides and other neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine and substance P. Endogenous opioids bind to opioid receptors expressed on these neurons to regulate gastrointestinal signalling, motility, and balance of fluids and electrolytes.[A251630]    Loperamide acts on the mu-opioid receptor expressed on the circular and longitudinal intestinal muscle.[A251610] Receptor binding leads to the recruitment of G-protein receptor kinases and the activation of downstream molecular cascades that inhibit enteric nerve activity.[A251630] By inhibiting the excitability of enteric neurons, loperamide suppresses neurotransmitter release, pre-synaptic and post-synaptic inhibition of transmission of excitatory and inhibitory motor pathways, and secretomotor pathways.[A251630] Loperamide inhibits the release of acetylcholine and prostaglandins,[L42790] thereby reducing propulsive peristalsis and increasing intestinal transit time.[A251615, L42790] Loperamide stimulates the intestinal absorption of water and electrolytes by inhibiting calmodulin.[A251615] Loperamide can bind to and hyperpolarize submucosal secretomotor neurons, promoting dry, hard stools.[A251630]"
528,"Indicated for the treatment of epilepsy.Progabide is an analog and prodrug of gamma-aminobutyric acid. It is commonly used in the treatment of epilepsy. It has agonistic activity for both the GABAA and GABAB receptors. In clinical trials, progabide has been investigated for Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, clinical depression and anxiety disorder; its therapeutic effectiveness in these conditions is not fully elucidated.Progabide, a fatty acid derivative, is a GABA receptor agonist used to treat the symptoms of epilepsy.Progabide binds to both GABAA and GABAB receptors located on the terminals of primary afferent fibers. Binding to GABAA results in an increased affinity of the GABA receptor for the amino acid, an augmented flux of chloride ions across the terminal membrane, and an increase in the amount of presynaptic inhibition. Activation of the GABAB receptors retards the influx of calcium ions into the terminals, thereby reducing the evoked release of excitatory amino acids and possibly other transmitters."
529,"For short-term topical treatment of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of moderate to severe corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses of the scalp.Clocortolone is a medium potency corticosteroid that is often used as a topical cream for the relief of inflammatory oand pruritic (itching) arising from steroid-responsive dermatoses of the scalp.Like other topical corticosteroids, clocortolone has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Clocortolone is a moderate potency topical corticosteroid that should not be used with occlusive dressings. It is recommended that treatment should be limited to 2 consecutive weeks and therapy should be discontinued when adequate results have been achieved.The precise mechanism of the antiinflammatory activity of topical steroids in the treatment of steroid-responsive dermatoses, in general, is uncertain. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2. These enzyme transcriptional changes are mediated by the drug binding first to the glucocorticoid receptor. This complex can migrate to the cell nucleus which then binds to DNA initiating genetic activation and repression of various genes."
530,"For use as an adjunct to diet to lower the blood glucose in patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (Type II) whose hyperglycemia cannot be satisfactorily controlled by diet alone.A sulphonylurea hypoglycemic agent with actions and uses similar to those of chlorpropamide.Tolazamide is an oral blood glucose lowering drug of the sulfonylurea class. Tolazamide appears to lower the blood glucose acutely by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas, an effect dependent upon functioning beta cells in the pancreatic islets. The mechanism by which tolazamide lowers blood glucose during long-term administration has not been clearly established. With chronic administration in Type II diabetic patients, the blood glucose lowering effect persists despite a gradual decline in the insulin secretory response to the drug. Extrapancreatic effects may be involved in the mechanism of action of oral sulfonylurea hypoglycemic drugs. Some patients who are initially responsive to oral hypoglycemic drugs, including tolazamide, may become unresponsive or poorly responsive over time. Alternatively, tolazamide may be effective in some patients who have become unresponsive to one or more other sulfonylurea drugs. In addition to its blood glucose lowering actions, tolazamide produces a mild diuresis by enhancement of renal free water clearance.Sulfonylureas likely bind to ATP-sensitive potassium-channel receptors on the pancreatic cell surface, reducing potassium conductance and causing depolarization of the membrane. Depolarization stimulates calcium ion influx through voltage-sensitive calcium channels, raising intracellular concentrations of calcium ions, which induces the secretion, or exocytosis, of insulin."
531,"Indicated when parenteral therapy is necessary for inotropic support in the short-term treatment of patients with cardiac decompensation due to depressed contractility resulting either from organic heart disease or from cardiac surgical procedures.A beta-1 agonist catecholamine that has cardiac stimulant action without evoking vasoconstriction or tachycardia. It is proposed as a cardiotonic after myocardial infarction or open heart surgery.Dobutamine is a direct-acting inotropic agent whose primary activity results from stimulation of the beta-adrenoceptors of the heart while producing comparatively mild chronotropic, hypertensive, arrhythmogenic, and vasodilative effects. Dobutamine acts primarily on beta-1 adrenergic receptors, with negligible effects on beta-2 or alpha receptors. It does not cause the release of endogenous norepinephrine, as does dopamine. Dobutamine directly stimulates beta-1 receptors of the heart to increase myocardial contractility and stroke volume, resulting in increased cardiac output."
532,"Oxazepam is indicated for the management of anxiety disorders and for the short-term relief of symptoms of anxiety.[L13895] It may also be used in the management of alcohol withdrawal symptoms.[L13895]Oxazepam is an intermediate-acting, 3-hydroxybenzodiazepine used in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal and anxiety disorders. Oxazepam, like related 3-hydroxybenzodiazepine [lorazepam], is considered less susceptible to pharmacokinetic variability based on patient-specific factors (e.g. age, liver disease) - this feature is advantageous as compared to other benzodiazepines, and is likely owing in part to oxazepam's relatively simple metabolism.[A203516] It is an active metabolite of both [diazepam] and [temazepam][A39486] and undergoes very little biotransformation following absorption, making it unlikely to participate in pharmacokinetic interactions.[L13895]Benzodiazepines, including oxazepam, exert their sedative and anxiolytic effects by potentiating the effects of endogenous GABA, the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS.[A34430] Compared to other benzodiazepines, it has relatively low potency and a moderate duration of action.[A34430] Oxazepam should be administered with caution to patients for whom a drop in blood pressure may lead to cardiac complications as, in rare cases, it may cause hypotension.[L13895]Like other benzodiazepines, oxazepam exerts its anxiolytic effects by potentiating the effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on GABA(A) receptors, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the mammalian brain.[A198957] GABA(A) receptors are a component of GABA-gated ionotropic chloride channels that produce inhibitory postsynaptic potentials - following activation by GABA, the channel undergoes a conformational change that allows the passage of chloride ions through the channel. The inhibitory potentials produced by GABA neurotransmission play an integral role in the suppression and control of epileptiform nerve firing such as that seen in epilepsy, which makes the GABA system a desirable target in the treatment of epilepsy.    Benzodiazepines are positive allosteric modulators of GABA(A) function. They bind to the interface between alpha (α) and gamma (γ) subunits on the receptor, commonly referred to as the benzodiazepine binding site, and modulate the receptor such that its inhibitory response to GABA binding is dramatically increased.[A198957]"
533,"Donepezil, administered orally[L7916] or via transdermal delivery system,[L41125] is indicated for the treatment of dementia of the Alzheimer's type.L7937]     Off-label uses include the management of vascular dementia, Parkinson's Disease-associated dementia, and Lewy body dementia, amongst others.[A182333,T668]In 2016, the global burden of dementia was estimated to be 43.8 million, demonstrating a significant increase from a global prevalence of 20.2 million in 1990.[A182411] Donepezil, also known as Aricept, is a piperidine derivative acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used in the management of the dementia of Alzheimer's Disease, and in some cases, is used to manage other types of dementia.     Donepezil was first approved by the FDA in 1996, and its extended-release form was approved in combination with [Memantine] in 2014 to manage moderate and severe forms of Alzheimer's dementia.[L7916,L7937] A donepezil transdermal delivery system, Adlarity, was approved by the FDA in March 2022 for the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia.[L41125] Though it does not alter the progression of Alzheimer's disease, donepezil is effective in managing the symptoms of its associated dementia.[T668]By inhibiting the acetylcholinesterase enzyme, donepezil improves the cognitive and behavioral signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease, which may include apathy, aggression, confusion, and psychosis.[A182333,A182408]  The commonly accepted cholinergic hypothesis[A182369] proposes that a portion of the cognitive and behavioral decline associated with Alzheimer's are the result of decreased cholinergic transmission in the central nervous system. Donepezil selectively and reversibly inhibits the acetylcholinesterase enzyme, which normally breaks down acetylcholine. The main pharmacological actions of this drug are believed to occur as the result of this enzyme inhibition, enhancing cholinergic transmission, which relieves the symptoms of Alzheimer's dementia. In addition to the above, other mechanisms of action of donepezil are possible, including the opposition of glutamate-induced excitatory transmission via downregulation of NMDA receptors and the regulation of amyloid proteins, which have demonstrated significant effects on the disease process of Alzheimer's.[A182333,A182351,A182444] Other possible targets for donepezil may also include the inhibition various inflammatory signaling pathways, exerting neuroprotective effects.[A182339,A182393]"
534,"For the relief of moderate to severe pain.A narcotic used as a pain medication. It appears to be an agonist at kappa opioid receptors and an antagonist or partial agonist at mu opioid receptors. Nalbuphine is the only opioid analgesic that is not a controlled substance in the United States.Nalbuphine is a synthetic opioid agonist-antagonist analgesic of the phenanthrene series. Nalbuphine's analgesic potency is essentially equivalent to that of [morphine] on a milligram basis. The opoioid antagonist activity of nalbuphine is about one-fourth to that of [nalorphine] and 10 times to that of [pentazocine]. Nalbuphine by itself has potent opioid antagonist activity at doses equal to or lower than its analgesic dose. When administered following or concurrent with mu agonist opioid analgesics (e.g., morphine, oxymorphone, fentanyl), nalbuphine may partially reverse or block opioid-induced respiratory depression from the mu agonist analgesic. Nalbuphine may precipitate withdrawal in patients dependent on opioid drugs. Nalbuphine should be used with caution in patients who have been receiving mu opioid analgesics on a regular basis.The exact mechanism of action is unknown, but is believed to interact with an opiate receptor site in the CNS (probably in or associated with the limbic system). The opiate antagonistic effect may result from competitive inhibition at the opiate receptor, but may also be a result of other mechanisms. Nalbuphine is thought primarily to be a kappa agonist. It is also a partial mu antagonist analgesic, with some binding to the delta receptor and minimal agonist activity at the sigma receptor."
535,"For relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses, particularly dry, scaling localized lesionsA corticosteroid used topically in the treatment of various skin disorders. It is usually employed as a cream or an ointment, and is also used as a polyethylene tape with an adhesive. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p733)Flurandrenolide is primarily effective because of its anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive actions.Flurandrenolide is a topical corticosteroid.  It is normally applied to a plastic tape called Cordran.  Cordran is primarily effective because of its anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive actions. Flurandrenolide, which is slowly released from the Cordran tape, binds to the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor. After binding the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific target genes. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Specifically glucocorticoids induce lipocortin-1 (annexin-1) synthesis, which then binds to cell membranes preventing the phospholipase A2 from coming into contact with its substrate arachidonic acid. This leads to diminished eicosanoid production. Cyclooxygenase (both COX-1 and COX-2) expression is also suppressed, potentiating the effect. In another words, the two main products in inflammation Prostaglandins and Leukotrienes are inhibited by the action of Glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids also stimulate the lipocortin-1 escaping to the extracellular space, where it binds to the leukocyte membrane receptors and inhibits various inflammatory events: epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, respiratory burst and the release of various inflammatory mediators (lysosomal enzymes, cytokines, tissue plasminogen activator, chemokines etc.) from neutrophils, macrophages and mastocytes. Additionally the immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference with antigen-antibody binding.  Like other glucocorticoid agents Fluocinolone acetonide acts as a physiological antagonist to insulin by decreasing glycogenesis (formation of glycogen).  It also promotes the breakdown of lipids (lipolysis), and proteins, leading to the mobilization of extrahepatic amino acids and ketone bodies. This leads to increased circulating glucose concentrations (in the blood). There is also decreased glycogen formation in the liver.    "

537,"For the relief of anxiety, tension, and apprehension, also used as an anticonvulsant for the treatment of epilepsy.A barbiturate that is metabolized to phenobarbital. It has been used for similar purposes, especially in epilepsy, but there is no evidence mephobarbital offers any advantage over phenobarbital.Methylphenobarbital, a barbiturate, is used in combination with acetaminophen or aspirin and caffeine for its sedative and relaxant effects in the treatment of tension headaches, migraines, and pain. Barbiturates act as nonselective depressants of the central nervous system (CNS), capable of producing all levels of CNS mood alteration from excitation to mild sedation, hypnosis, and deep coma. In sufficiently high therapeutic doses, barbiturates induce anesthesia.Methylphenobarbital binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl- ionopore at the GABAA receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl- ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged."
538,"For use in the management of the manifestations of psychotic disorders and for the control of severe nausea and vomiting in adults.An antipsychotic phenothiazine derivative with actions and uses similar to those of chlorpromazine.Perphenazine is a piperazinyl phenothiazine, acts on the central nervous system, and has a greater behavioral potency than other phenothiazine derivatives whose side chains do not contain a piperazine moiety. It is a member of a class of drugs called phenothiazines, which are dopamine D1/D2 receptor antagonists. Perphenazine is 10 to 15 times as potent as chlorpromazine; that means perphenazine is a highly potent antipsychotic. In equivalent doses it has approximately the same frequency and severity of early and late extrapypramidal side-effects compared to Haloperidol.Binds to the dopamine D1 and dopamine D2 receptors and inhibits their activity. The mechanism of the anti-emetic effect is due predominantly to blockage of the dopamine D2 neurotransmitter receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone and vomiting centre. Perphenazine also binds the alpha andrenergic receptor. This receptor's action is mediated by association with G proteins that activate a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system."
539,"For the treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma.An antineoplastic agent. It has significant activity against melanomas. (from Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 31st ed, p564). Dacarbazine with Oblimersen is in clinical trials for the treatment of malignant melanoma.Dacarbazine is a synthetic analog of naturally occurring purine precursor 5-amino-1H-imidazole-4-carboxamide (AIC). After intravenous administration of dacarbazine, the volume of distribution exceeds total body water content suggesting localization in some body tissue, probably the liver. Its disappearance from the plasma is biphasic with initial half-life of 19 minutes and a terminal half-life of 5 hours. 1 In a patient with renal and hepatic dysfunctions, the half-lives were lengthened to 55 minutes and 7.2 hours. 1 The average cumulative excretion of unchanged DTIC in the urine is 40% of the injected dose in 6 hours. 1 DTIC is subject to renal tubular secretion rather than glomerular filtration. At therapeutic concentrations dacarbazine is not appreciably bound to human plasma protein.The mechanism of action is not known, but appears to exert cytotoxic effects via its action as an alkylating agent. Other theories include DNA synthesis inhibition by its action as a purine analog, and interaction with SH groups. Dacarbazine is not cell cycle-phase specific."

541,"Temozolomide is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma concomitantly with radiotherapy and for use as maintenance treatment thereafter. It is also indicated for the treatment of refractory anaplastic astrocytoma in adult patients or adjuvant therapy for adults with newly diagnosed anaplastic astrocytoma.[L48265]Refractory anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO grade III) and Glioblastoma multiforme (WHO grade IV) are primary malignant brain tumours with poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Despite considerable genetic heterogeneity, these tumours often have impaired DNA repair systems, rendering them initially sensitive to alkylating agents, although they invariably develop resistance to these agents over time.[A229848, A229858, L32033] Temozolomide is an imidazotetrazine prodrug that is stable at acidic pH but undergoes spontaneous nonenzymatic hydrolysis at neutral or slightly basic pH; these properties allow for both oral and intravenous administration.[A229853, A229888, A229923, L32033] Following initial hydrolysis, further reactions liberate a highly reactive methyl diazonium cation capable of methylating various residues on adenosine and guanine bases leading to DNA lesions and eventual apoptosis.[A229853, A229923] Temozomolide as an adjunct to radiotherapy followed by maintenance dosing remains the standard of care for both Glioblastoma and refractory anaplastic astrocytoma.[L32033]    Temozolomide was granted FDA approval on August 11, 1999, as an oral capsule and subsequently on February 27, 2009, as an intravenous injection. It is currently marketed under the trademark TEMODAR® by Merck.[L32033]Temozolomide is a prodrug of the imidazotetrazine class that requires nonenzymatic hydrolysis at physiological pH _in vivo_ to perform alkylation of adenine/guanine residues, leading to DNA damage through futile repair cycles and eventual cell death. Temozolomide treatment is associated with myelosuppression, which is likely to be more severe in females and geriatric patients. Patients must have an ANC of ≥1.5 x 109/L and a platelet count of ≥100 x 109/L before starting therapy and must be monitored weekly during the concomitant radiotherapy phase, on days one and 22 of maintenance cycles, and weekly at any point where the ANC/platelet count falls below the specified values until recovery. Cases of myelodysplastic syndrome and secondary malignancies, including myeloid leukemia, have been observed following temozolomide administration. Pneumocystis pneumonia may occur in patients undergoing treatment, and prophylaxis should be provided for patients in the concomitant phase of therapy with monitoring at all stages. Severe hepatotoxicity has also been reported, and liver testing should be performed at baseline, midway through the first cycle, before each subsequent cycle, and approximately two to four weeks after the last dose. Animal studies suggest that temozolomide has significant embryo-fetal toxicity; male and female patients should practice contraception up to three and six months following the last dose of temozolomide, respectively.[L32033]Glioblastoma (glioblastoma multiforme) is the most common and aggressive adult primary brain tumour, accounting for 45.6% of all primary malignant brain tumours. Primarily defined histopathologically by necrosis and microvascular proliferation (WHO grade IV classification), glioblastomas are commonly treated through radiotherapy and concomitant alkylation-based chemotherapy with temozolomide.[A229848] Temozolomide (TMZ) is a small (194 Da) lipophilic alkylating agent of the imidazotetrazine class that is stable at acidic pH, allowing for both oral and intravenous dosing, and can cross the blood-brain barrier to affect CNS tumours.[A229853, A229858, L32033, A229893] After absorption, TMZ undergoes spontaneous nonenzymatic breakdown at physiological pH to form 5-(3-methyltriazen-1-yl) imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC), which then reacts with water to produce 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide (AIC) and a highly reactive methyl diazonium cation.[A229853] Brain tumours such as glioblastoma typically possess a more alkaline pH than healthy tissue, favouring TMZ activation within tumour tissue.[A229853]    The methyl diazonium cation is highly reactive and methylates DNA at the N7 position of guanine (N7-MeG, 70%), the N3 position of adenine (N3-MeA, 9%), and the O6 position of guanine (O6-MeG, 6%). Although more prevalent, N7-MeG and N3-MeA are rapidly repaired by the base excision repair pathway and are not primary mediators of temozolomide toxicity, although N3-MeA lesions are lethal if not repaired. By comparison, repair of O6-MeG requires action by the suicide enzyme methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), which removes the methyl group to restore guanine. If not repaired by MGMT, O6-MeG mispairs with thymine, activating the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) pathway that removes the thymine (not the O6-MeG), resulting in futile cycles of repair and eventual DNA strand breaks leading to apoptosis.[A229853] As MMR activity is crucial for temozolomide cytotoxicity, cells that have reduced or absent MGMT function and an intact MMR pathway are the most sensitive to temozolomide treatment.[A229853, A229858] Glioblastomas that upregulate MGMT downregulate MMR or alter both are resistant to TMZ, leading to treatment failure.[A229853]    More recently, increased interest has also been shown in the immunomodulatory effects of TMZ, related to its myelosuppressive effects. Counterintuitively, lymphodepletion may enhance the antitumour effects of cellular immunotherapy and improve the dynamics of memory cells by altering tumour-specific versus tumour-tolerant populations. The depletion of tumour-localized immunosuppressive T<sub>reg</sub> cells may contribute to an improved response to immunotherapy. Hence, TMZ treatment may also form the backbone of immunotherapy strategies against glioblastoma in the future.[A229873]"

Levorphanol is similar to morphine in its actions, however it is up to 8 times more potent than morphine. Levorphanol produces a degree of respiratory depression similar to that produced by morphine at equianalgesic doses, and like many mu-opioid drugs, levorphanol produces euphoria or has a positive effect on mood in many individuals.Like other mu-agonist opioids it is believed to act at receptors in the periventricular and periaqueductal gray matter in both the brain and spinal cord to alter the transmission and perception of pain."

544,"For treatment of Wilson's disease, cystinuria and active rheumatoid arthritis.Penicillamine is a pharmaceutical of the chelator class. The pharmaceutical form is D-penicillamine, as L-penicillamine is toxic (it inhibits the action of pyridoxine). It is an α-amino acid metabolite of penicillin, although it has no antibiotic properties.Penicillamine is a chelating agent used in the treatment of Wilson's disease. It is also used to reduce cystine excretion in cystinuria and to treat patients with severe, active rheumatoid arthritis unresponsive to conventional therapy. Penicillamine is used as a form of immunosuppression to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Penicillamine inhibits macrophages, decreases IL-1 and the number of T-lymphocytes, and prevents collagen cross linkage. In Wilson's disease it binds copper, allowing it to be eliminated in the urine.Penicillamine is a chelating agent recommended for the removal of excess copper in patients with Wilson's disease. From in vitro studies which indicate that one atom of copper combines with two molecules of penicillamine. Penicillamine also reduces excess cystine excretion in cystinuria. This is done, at least in part, by disulfide interchange between penicillamine and cystine, resulting in formation of penicillamine-cysteine disulfide, a substance that is much more soluble than cystine and is excreted readily. Penicillamine interferes with the formation of cross-links between tropocollagen molecules and cleaves them when newly formed. The mechanism of action of penicillamine in rheumatoid arthritis is unknown although it appears to suppress disease activity. Unlike cytotoxic immunosuppressants, penicillamine markedly lowers IgM rheumatoid factor but produces no significant depression in absolute levels of serum immunoglobulins. Also unlike cytotoxic immunosuppressants which act on both, penicillamine in vitro depresses T-cell activity but not B-cell activity."

Though its mechanism of action has not been clearly established, most of its actions appear to be associated with inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis via the arachidonic acid pathway. Diflunisal is used to relieve pain accompanied with inflammation and in the symptomatic treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.Diflunisal is a nonsteroidal drug with analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties. It is a peripherally-acting non-narcotic analgesic drug. Habituation, tolerance and addiction have not been reported. Diflunisal is a difluorophenyl derivative of salicylic acid. Chemically, diflunisal differs from aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) in two respects. The first of these two is the presence of a difluorophenyl substituent at carbon 1. The second difference is the removal of the 0-acetyl group from the carbon 4 position. Diflunisal is not metabolized to salicylic acid, and the fluorine atoms are not displaced from the difluorophenyl ring structure.The precise mechanism of the analgesic and anti-inflammatory actions of diflunisal is not known. Diflunisal is a prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor. In animals, prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain. Since prostaglandins are known to be among the mediators of pain and inflammation, the mode of action of diflunisal may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues."
547,"Vardenafil is indicated for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.[L45563,L45568,L45573]Vardenafil is a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) and an oral therapy for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.[L45563,L45568] During sexual stimulation, nitric oxide (NO) is released from nerve endings and endothelial cells in the corpus cavernosum, activating the enzyme guanylate cyclase and increasing the synthesis of cGMP in the smooth muscle cells of the corpus cavernosum. PDE5 inhibitors, such as vardenafil, inhibit the degradation of cGMP and allow increased blood flow into the penis, resulting in an erection.[A258303,L45563,L45568]. Compared to [sildenafil] and [tadalafil], vardenafil is a more potent inhibitor of PDE5; however, its selectivity for other PDE isoforms is lower than the one detected for tadalafil.[A258318]    The FDA approved the use of vardenafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in 2003. Although other PDE5 inhibitors such as [sildenafil] and [tadalafil] have been associated with rare cases of acute liver injury, the use of vardenafil has not been linked to hepatotoxic effects.[A258313] The use of vardenafil as a monotherapy for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension has also been evaluated.[A258308]Vardenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), an enzyme responsible for the degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. The presence of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum leads to smooth muscle relaxation, an increased inflow of blood and an erection. Therefore, in patients with erectile dysfunction given vardenafil, normal sexual stimulation will increase cGMP levels in the corpus cavernosum. Without sexual stimulation and no cGMP production, vardenafil should not cause an erection.[L45563,L45568]     Vardenafil should not be used in men for whom sexual activity is not recommended due to their underlying cardiovascular status. There is also a risk of developing prolonged erections that last longer than 4 hours, as well as priapism. In the event of a sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes, patients should stop using vardenafil. Patients taking PDE5 inhibitors, such as vardenafil, may also develop sudden hearing loss and experience a prolonged QT interval.[L45563,L45568]Vardenafil inhibits cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP) specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for the degradation of cyclic GMP in the corpus cavernosum located around the penis. Penile erection during sexual stimulation is caused by increased penile blood flow resulting from the relaxation of penile arteries and corpus cavernosal smooth muscle. This response is mediated by the release of nitric oxide (NO) from nerve terminals and endothelial cells, which stimulates the synthesis of cyclic GMP in smooth muscle cells. Cyclic GMP causes smooth muscle relaxation and increased blood flow into the corpus cavernosum. The tissue concentration of cyclic GMP is regulated by both the rates of synthesis and degradation via phosphodiesterases (PDEs), and the most abundant PDE in the human corpus cavernosum is PDE5. Therefore, the inhibition of PDE5 by vardenafil enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cyclic GMP.[L45563]"
548,"It also used in the short term treatment of active benign gastric ulcers and maintenance therapy of gastric ulcers at a reduced dose. In addition to the above, ranitidine can be used for the treatment of GERD symptoms, treatment of erosive esophagitis (endoscopically diagnosed) and the maintenance of gastric or duodenal ulcer healing.[L10818,L10821]Ranitidine is a commonly used drug, classified as a histamine H2-receptor antagonist, and belongs to the same drug class as [cimetidine] and [famotidine]. This drug helps to prevent and treat gastric-acid associated conditions, including ulcers, because of its ability to decrease gastric acid secretion.[A176759,L10818] Ranitidine is often referred to as Zantac, and is available in various forms, including tablet, injection, and effervescent tablet preparations.[L10818,F4253]    The prevalence of GERD is thought to be 10-20% in western countries.[A176843] Ranitidine has proven to be an effective treatment for relieving uncomfortable symptoms of gastric acid associated conditions and is therefore widely used in GERD and other gastric-acid related conditions.[A176849,L10818]Ranitidine decreases the secretion of gastric acid stimulated by food and drugs.  It also reduces the secretion of gastric acid in hypersecretory conditions such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.[A176852,L10818] Marked improvements in the appearance of the esophageal tissues have been observed by endoscopic imaging after ranitidine therapy.[A176849,L10818]      After a meal, the hormone gastrin, produced by cells in the lining of the stomach, stimulates the release of histamine, which then binds to histamine H2 receptors, leading to the secretion of gastric acid. Ranitidine reduces the secretion of gastric acid by reversible binding to histamine (H2) receptors, which are found on gastric parietal cells. This process leads to the inhibition of histamine binding to this receptor, causing the reduction of gastric acid secretion. The relief of gastric-acid related symptoms can occur as soon as 60 minutes after administration of a single dose, and the effects can last from 4-10 hours, providing fast and effective symptomatic relief.[A176774,T533,L10818]"
549,"Immediate-release formulations of tacrolimus are indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in adult and pediatric patients receiving allogeneic liver, kidney, heart, or lung transplants, in combination with other immunosuppressants.[L41005]    Topical tacrolimus ointment is indicated as second-line therapy for short-term and non-continuous treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in non-immunocompromised adults and children who have failed to respond adequately to other topical treatments or for whom alternative treatments are not advisable.[L3935] Both available strengths are indicated in adult patients, while only the lower strength (0.03%) formulation is indicated in pediatric patients between 2 and 15 years of age.[L3935]Tacrolimus (also FK-506 or Fujimycin) is an immunosuppressive drug whose main use is after organ transplant to reduce the activity of the patient's immune system and so the risk of organ rejection. It is also used in a topical preparation in the treatment of severe atopic dermatitis, severe refractory uveitis after bone marrow transplants, and the skin condition vitiligo. It was discovered in 1984 from the fermentation broth of a Japanese soil sample that contained the bacteria Streptomyces tsukubaensis. Tacrolimus is chemically known as a macrolide. It reduces peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity by binding to the immunophilin FKBP-12 (FK506 binding protein) creating a new complex. This FKBP12-FK506 complex inhibits calcineurin which inhibits T-lymphocyte signal transduction and IL-2 transcription.Tacrolimus acts by reducing peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity by binding to the immunophilin FKBP-12 (FK506 binding protein) creating a new complex. This inhibits both T-lymphocyte signal transduction and IL-2 transcription. Tacrolimus has similar activity to cyclosporine but rates of rejection are lower with tacrolimus. Tacrolimus has also been shown to be effective in the topical treatment of eczema, particularly atopic eczema. It suppresses inflammation in a similar way to steroids, but is not as powerful. An important dermatological advantage of tacrolimus is that it can be used directly on the face; topical steroids cannot be used on the face, as they thin the skin dramatically there. On other parts of the body, topical steroid are generally a better treatment.The mechanism of action of tacrolimus in atopic dermatitis is not known. While the following have been observed, the clinical significance of these observations in atopic dermatitis is not known. It has been demonstrated that tacrolimus inhibits T-lymphocyte activation by first binding to an intracellular protein, FKBP-12. A complex of tacrolimus-FKBP-12, calcium, calmodulin, and calcineurin is then formed and the phosphatase activity of calcineurin is inhibited. This prevents the dephosphorylation and translocation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NF-AT), a nuclear component thought to initiate gene transcription for the formation of lymphokines. Tacrolimus also inhibits the transcription for genes which encode IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, GM-CSF, and TNF-, all of which are involved in the early stages of T-cell activation. Additionally, tacrolimus has been shown to inhibit the release of pre-formed mediators from skin mast cells and basophils, and to downregulate the expression of FceRI on Langerhans cells."
550,"For the treatment of hypertension, angina, and arrhythmiaOne of the adrenergic beta-antagonists used as an antihypertensive, anti-anginal, and anti-arrhythmic agent. Alprenolol is no longer marketed by AstraZeneca, but may still be available in generic varieties.Alprenolol is a non-selective beta-blocker used in the treatment of hypertension, edema, ventricular tachycardias, and atrial fibrillation. Alprenolol impairs AV node conduction and decreases sinus rate and may also increase plasma triglycerides and decrease HDL-cholesterol levels. Alprenolol is nonpolar and hydrophobic, with low to moderate lipid solubility. Alprenolol has little to no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and, unlike some other beta-adrenergic blocking agents, alprenolol has little direct myocardial depressant activity and does not have an anesthetic-like membrane-stabilizing action.Alprenolol non-selectively blocks beta-1 adrenergic receptors mainly in the heart, inhibiting the effects of epinephrine and norepinephrine resulting in a decrease in heart rate and blood pressure. Also, with a more minor effect, by binding beta-2 receptors in the juxtaglomerular apparatus, alprenolol inhibits the production of renin, thereby inhibiting angiotensin II and aldosterone production and therefore inhibits the vasoconstriction and water retention due to angiotensin II and aldosterone, respectively."
551,"For the treatment and prophylaxis of premature labourAdrenergic beta-agonist used to control premature labor.Beta-2 adrenergic receptors are located at sympathetic neuroeffector junctions of many organs, including uterus. Ritodrine is beta-2 adrenergic agonist. It stimulates beta-2 adrenergic receptor, increases cAMP level and decreases intracellular calcium concentration. The decrease of calcium concentration leads to a relaxation of uterine smooth muscle and, therefore, a decrease in premature uterine contractions. Ritodrine is beta-2 adrenergic agonist. It binds to beta-2 adrenergic receptors on outer membrane of myometrial cell, activates adenyl cyclase to increase the level of cAMP which decreases intracellular calcium and leads to a decrease of uterine contractions."
552,"Dorzolamide is indicated for the management of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma.[L11380]    Its pre-operative use was also investigated to prevent elevated intraocular pressure after neodynium yttrium aluminum garnet laser posterior capsulotomy.[A190183]Dorzolamide is a non-bacteriostatic sulfonamide derivative [A1304] and topical carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitor that treats elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) associated with open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension.[L11377] It works by blocking an enzyme in the ciliary process that regulates ion balance and fluid pressure in the eyes.[A1303] Unlike oral CA inhibitors, dorzolamide has negligible effects of acid-base or electrolyte disturbances and other systemic adverse effects.[A1304] First marketed in 1995,[A190624] dorzolamide is available in ophthalmic solutions as monotherapy marketed as Trusopt [L11377] or in combination with [timolol] as Cosopt PF.[L11380]Dorzolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that reduces elevated intraocular pressure in open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. When used in combination with topic beta-adrenergic antagonists, dorzolamide has an additive effect of lowering intraocular pressure. The peak ocular hypotensive effect of dorzolamide is observed at about 2 hours following ophthalmic administration.[A1304]Elevated intraocular pressure is a characteristic manifestation of ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma. The level of intraocular pressure (IOP) is governed by the balance between the production of aqueous humour (by ocular ciliary processes) and its outflow from the anterior segment of the eye via trabecular (conventional) or uveoscleral (unconventional) pathways. When there is an increase in the resistance to the trabecular outflow of aqueous humour, the intraocular pressure is elevated. Subsequently, optic nerve damage can occur from blood flow restrictions and mechanical distortion of ocular structures. Optic nerve damage can further result in optic disc cupping and progressive visual field loss (and blindness in some cases).[A1304]     Carbonic anhydrase (CA) is a ubiquitous enzyme that catalyzes the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate ions and dehydration of carbonic acid.[A1304,L11377] In the ocular ciliary processes, the local production of bicarbonate by CAs promotes sodium and fluid transport. CA-II is a key isoenzyme found primarily in red blood cells (RBCs) that regulates aqueous humour production.[A1304] Dorzolamide is a highly specific CA-II inhibitor, where it displays a 4000-fold higher affinity for carbonic anhydrase II than carbonic anhydrase I.[A1304] The inhibition of CA-II in the ciliary process disrupts the formation of bicarbonate ions and reduces sodium and fluid transport, which leads to decreased aqueous humour secretion and reduced intraocular pressure.[A1304,L11377]"
553,"Used as eye drops to inhibit the miosis (pupil constriction) that may occur during ocular surgery.An ibuprofen-type anti-inflammatory analgesic and antipyretic. It inhibits prostaglandin synthesis and has been proposed as an anti-arthritic. It is no longer approved for use in the United States.Suprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory analgesic and antipyretic. Ophthalmic anti-inflammatory medicines are used in the eye to lessen problems that can occur during or after some kinds of eye surgery. Sometimes, the pupil of the eye gets smaller during an operation (pupil constriction), making it more difficult for the surgeon to reach some areas of the eye. Suprofen is used to help prevent this.Suprofen binds to the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) isoenzymes, preventing the synthesis of prostaglandins and reducing the inflammatory response. Cyclooxygenase catalyses the formation of prostaglandins and thromboxane from arachidonic acid (itself derived from the cellular phospholipid bilayer by phospholipase A2). Prostaglandins act (among other things) as messenger molecules in the process of inflammation. The overall result is a reduction in pain and inflammation in the eyes and the prevention of pupil constriction during surgery. Normally trauma to the anterior segment of the eye (especially the iris) increases endogenous prostaglandin synthesis which leads to constriction of the iris sphincter."
554,"For the treatment of euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia (e.g. the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, or in the setting of hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, pulmonary disorders, etc.) in hospitalized patients.Conivaptan is a non-peptide inhibitor of antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin). It was approved in 2004 for hyponatremia (low blood sodium levels) caused by syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Conivaptan inhibits both isotypes of the vasopressin receptor (V1a and V2).Conivaptan is a nonpeptide, dual antagonist of arginine vasopressin (AVP) V1A and V2 receptors. The level of AVP in circulating blood is critical for the regulation of water and electrolyte balance and is usually elevated in both euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. The AVP effect is mediated through V2 receptors, which are functionally coupled to aquaporin channels in the apical membrane of the collecting ducts of the kidney. These receptors help to maintain plasma osmolality within the normal range by increasing permeability of the renal collecting ducts to water. Vasopressin also causes vasoconstriction through its actions on vascular 1A receptors. The predominant pharmacodynamic effect of conivaptan in the treatment of hyponatremia is through its V2 antagonism of AVP in the renal collecting ducts, an effect that results in aquaresis, or excretion of free water. Conivaptan's antagonist activity on V1A receptors may also cause splanchnic vasodilation, resulting in possible hypotension or variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis. The pharmacodynamic effects of conivaptan include increased free water excretion (i.e., effective water clearance [EWC]) generally accompanied by increased net fluid loss, increased urine output, and decreased urine osmolality.Conivaptan is a dual AVP antagonist with nanomolar affinity for human arginine vasopressin V1A and V2 receptors in vitro. This antagonism occurs in the renal collecting ducts, resulting in aquaresis, or excretion of free water. "
555,"A number of prescription loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic products are specifically indicated for the treatment of post-operative inflammation and pain following ocular surgery [FDA Label]. Loteprednol Etabonate (LE) is a topical corticoid anti-inflammatory. It is used in ophthalmic solution for the treatment of steroid responsive inflammatory conditions of the eye such as allergic conjunctivitis, uveitis, acne rosacea, superficial punctate keratitis, herpes zoster keratitis, iritis, cyclitis, and selected infective conjunctivitides. As a nasal spray, it can be used for the treatment and management of seasonal allergic rhinitis.    Most prescription LE products, however, tend to be indicated for the treatment of post-operative inflammation and pain following ocular surgery [FDA Label]. A number of such new formulations that have been approved include Kala Pharmaceutical's Inveltys - the first twice-daily (BID) ocular corticosteroid approved for this indication, designed specifically to enhance patient compliance and simplified dosing compared to all other similar ocular steroids that are dosed four times daily [L4545].    Moreover, LE was purposefully engineered to be a 'soft drug', one that is designed to be active locally at the site of administration and then rapidly metabolized to inactive components after eliciting its actions at the desired location, thereby subsequently minimizing the chance for adverse effects [A38693].Loteprednol etabonate (LE) belongs to a unique class of corticosteroids with potent anti-inflammatory effects designed to be active at the site of action [A1312, L4539]. Animal studies have shown that LE has a binding affinity to steroid receptors that is 4.3 times greater than dexamethasone [L4539]. This particular class of steroids consists of bioactive molecules whose in-vivo transformation to non-toxic substances can be predicted from their chemistry and knowledge of enzymatic pathways in the body [L4539]. Cortienic acid is an inactive metabolite of hydrocortisone and analogs of cortienic acid are also devoid of corticosteroid activity [L4539]. Specifically, LE is an ester derivative of one of these analogs, cortienic acid etabonate [L4539]. In particular, LE possesses a metabolically labile 17 beta-chloromethyl ester function which was designed in order to be hydrolyzed to an inactive carboxylic acid moiety [A1312]. This inactive metabolite is more hydrophilic and is thus readily eliminated from the body [A1312]. LE also exhibits good ocular permeation properties and good skin permeation properties [A1312].Corticosteroids like loteprednol etabonate inhibit the inflammatory response to a variety of inciting agents and likely delay or slow healing [FDA Label, L4539, A1312]. They inhibit the edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation that are commonly associated with inflammation [FDA Label, A1312]. While glucocorticoids are known to bind to and activate the glucocorticoid receptor, the molecular mechanisms involved in glucocorticoid/glucocorticoid receptor-dependent modulation of inflammation are not clearly established [FDA Label, L4539, A1312]. Moreover, corticosteroids are thought to inhibit prostaglandin production through several independent mechanisms [FDA Label, A1312]. In particular, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins [F1467]. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid [F1467]. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2 [F1467].      The use of LE subsequently treats post-operative inflammation and pain following ocular surgery by managing the prostaglandin release, recruitment and travel of neutrophils and macrophages, and production of other inflammatory mediators that are intrinsically associated with the physical trauma of surgery [A1312]."
556,"Flupentixol is indicated for maintenance therapy of chronic schizophrenic patients whose main manifestations do not include excitement, agitation or hyperactivity.[L31808]    It is indicated for the management of depression in adult patients who may, or may not, also be showing signs of anxiety.[L31923]Flupentixol is an antipsychotic drug of the thioxanthene group. It exists in two geometric isomers, the trans(E) and pharmacologically active cis(Z) forms. Flupentixol decanoate is one of the active ingredients found in injectable drug formulations: it is produced by esterification of cis(Z)‐flupentixol with decanoic acid.[A229083] Flupentixol is an antagonist of both D1 and D2 dopamine receptors.[A229083]    Available as oral tablets or long-acting intramuscular injections, flupentixol is marketed under brand names such as Depixol and Fluanxol. It is approved for use in Canada and other countries around the world, but not in the US. It is used for the management of chronic schizophrenia in patients whose main manifestations do not include excitement, agitation or hyperactivity.[L31808] It has been marketed to manage symptoms of depression in patients who may or may not exhibit signs of anxiety.[L31923]Flupentixol is an antipsychotic agent with anxiolytic and mild sedative actions. It exerts weak anticholinergic and adrenergic effects. It possesses antiemetic actions. As flupentixol works by antagonizing dopamine actions, it can cause extrapyramidal effects,[L31808] mostly at doses greater than 10 mg. In clinical trials, flupentixol-induced extrapyramidal effects have been managed with anti-Parkinsonian drugs.[A229403] Drug esterification in the intramuscular formulation of the drug results in slow release of the drug from the injection site and a prolonged duration of action.[L31808] Flupentixol has been investigated for use in mild to moderate depression: compared to other antidepressant agents, flupentixol has a rapid onset of action, where antidepressive effects were observed within the first two to three days after administration.[A229403]    As with other antipsychotic agents, flupentixol can cause QTc prolongation and increase the risk of arrhythmias. In clinical trials, flupentixol was associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular adverse events, stroke, and venous thromboembolism. Flupentixol can elevate the levels of prolactin; however, the clinical significance of hyperprolactinemia caused by neuroleptic drugs is unclear. Long-term hyperprolactinemia, when associated with hypogonadism, may lead to decreased bone mineral density in both female and male subjects.One study demonstrated that _in vitro_, flupentixol docks to the ATP binding pocket of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), a lipid kinase that activates signalling pathways that are often hyperactivated in some cancers. Flupentixol inhibited the PI3K/AKT pathway and survival of lung cancer cells _in vitro_ and _in vivo_.[A229408]The mechanism of action of flupentixol is not completely understood. The antipsychotic actions are mainly thought to arise from cis(Z)-flupentixol, the active stereoisomer, acting as an antagonist at both dopamine D1 and D2 receptors with equal affinities.[A229398] Schizophrenia is a mental illness characterized by positive (such as hallucinations and delusions) and negative (such as affect flattening and apathy) symptoms. While several neurotransmitter systems are implicated in the pathophysiologic processes leading to the development of symptoms, the dopamine and glutamate systems have been extensively studied. It is generally understood that positive symptoms of schizophrenia arise from a dysregulated striatal dopamine pathway, leading to hyperstimulation of D2 receptors. Many antipsychotic agents work by blocking D2 receptors as antagonists;[A229428] similarly, cis(Z)-flupentixol, the active stereoisomer, is an antagonist at D2 receptors.[A229398] However, there is now evidence that antipsychotic agents can work by blocking other dopamine receptor subtypes, such as D1, D3, or D4 receptors.[A229413, A229433, A229438] One study showed that cis(Z)-flupentixol is an antagonist at both dopamine D1 and D2 receptors with equal affinities,[A229398] and binds to D3 and D4 receptors with lower affinities. It also binds to alpha-1 adrenoceptors.[A229083] Antidepressant effects of flupentixol are understood to be mediated by antagonism at 5-HT2A receptors, which are commonly downregulated following repeated antidepressant treatment.[A177847] Flupentixol also binds to 5-HT2C receptors.[A229083] "
557,"Also used as a first-line agent in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy, as well as a second-line agent in the treatment of congestive heart failure (only in those intolerant of ACE inhibitors).Eprosartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist used to treat hypertension. It performs 2 actions on the renin angiotensin system. By preventing the binding of angiotensin II to AT1, vascular smooth muscle relaxes and vasodilation occurs. By inhibiting norepinephrine production, blood pressure is further reduced.Angiotensin II, the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme [kininase II]. It is responsible for effects such as vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Eprosartan selectively blocks the binding of angiotensin II to the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor, which in turn leads to multiple effects including vasodilation, a reduction in the secretion of vasopressin, and reduction in the production and secretion of aldosterone. The resulting effect is a decrease in blood pressure.Eprosartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues (e.g., vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). There is also an AT2receptor found in many tissues but it is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Eprosartan does not exhibit any partial agonist activity at the AT1 receptor. Its affinity for the AT1 receptor is 1,000 times greater than for the AT2 receptor. In vitro binding studies indicate that eprosartan is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor. Eprosartan has also been shown to bind to AT1 receptors both presynaptically and synaptically. Its action on presynaptic AT1 receptors results in the inhibition of sympathetically stimulated noradrenaline release. Unlike ACE inhibitors, eprosartan and other ARBs do not interfere with response to bradykinins and substance P, which allows for the absence of adverse effects that are present in ACE inhibitors (eg. dry cough)."
558,"Sirolimus is indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients aged 13 years or older receiving renal transplants.cyclosporine should be withdrawn two to four months after transplantation. In patients at high-immunologic risk (defined as Black recipients and/or repeat renal transplant recipients who lost a previous allograft for immunologic reason and/or patients with high panel-reactive antibodies [PRA; peak PRA level > 80%]), it is recommended that sirolimus be used in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids for the first year following transplantation.[L19809]    It is also used to treat lymphangioleiomyomatosis.[L19809]     In the US, albumin-bound sirolimus for intravenous injection is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic malignant perivascular epithelioid cell tumour (PEComa).[L39267]    In Europe, it is recommended that sirolimus for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in renal transplants is used in combination with cyclosporin microemulsion and corticosteroids for two to three months. Sirolimus may be continued as maintenance therapy with corticosteroids only if cyclosporin microemulsion can be progressively discontinued.[L7021]    Topical sirolimus is indicated for the treatment of facial angiofibroma associated with tuberous sclerosis in adults and pediatric patients six years of age and older.[L41489]Sirolimus, also known as rapamycin, is a macrocyclic lactone antibiotic produced by bacteria _Streptomyces hygroscopicus_, which was isolated from the soil of the Vai Atari region of Rapa Nui (Easter Island).[A242412] It was first isolated and identified as an antifungal agent with potent anticandida activity; however, after its potent antitumor and immunosuppressive activities were later discovered, it was extensively investigated as an immunosuppressive and antitumour agent.[A13448] Its primary mechanism of action is the inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase that regulates cell growth, proliferation, and survival. mTOR is an important therapeutic target for various diseases, as it was shown to regulate longevity and maintain normal glucose homeostasis.[A242417] Targeting mTOR received more attention especially in cancer, as mTOR signalling pathways are constitutively activated in many types of human cancer.[A1320]    Sirolimus was first approved by the FDA in 1999 for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients aged 13 years and older receiving renal transplants.[A242372] In November 2000, the drug was recognized by the European Agency as an alternative to calcineurin antagonists for maintenance therapy with corticosteroids.[A242412] In May 2015, the FDA approved sirolimus for the treatment of patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis.[L39292] In November 2021, albumin-bound sirolimus for intravenous injection was approved by the FDA for the treatment of adults with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic malignant perivascular epithelioid cell tumour (PEComa).[L39267] Sirolimus was also investigated in other cancers such as skin cancer, Kaposi’s Sarcoma, cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, and tuberous sclerosis.[A242372] The topical formulation of sirolimus, marketed as HYFTOR, was approved by the FDA in April 2022: this marks the first topical treatment approved in the US for facial angiofibroma associated with tuberous sclerosis complex.[L41494]Sirolimus is an immunosuppressant drug with antifungal and antitumour effects.[A1321] In animal models, sirolimus prolonged allograft survival following various organ transplants and reversed an acute rejection of heart and kidney allografts in rats. Upon oral administration of 2 mg/day and 5 mg/day, sirolimus significantly reduced the incidence of organ rejection in low- to moderate-immunologic risk renal transplant patients at six months following transplantation compared with either azathioprine or placebo. In some studies, the immunosuppressive effect of sirolimus lasted up to six months after discontinuation of therapy: this tolerization effect is alloantigen-specific.[L19809] Sirolimus potently inhibits antigen-induced proliferation of T cells, B cells, and antibody production.[A13448]    In rodent models of autoimmune disease, sirolimus suppressed immune-mediated events associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, collagen-induced arthritis, autoimmune type I diabetes, autoimmune myocarditis, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, graft-versus-host disease, and autoimmune uveoretinitis.[L19809]Sirolimus works by inhibiting T-lymphocyte activation and proliferation stimulated by antigens and cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, and IL-15. In target cells, sirolimus binds to the cytoplasmic receptor FK506-binding protein-12 (FKBP12), an immunophilin, to form an immunosuppressive complex. FKBP12-sirolimus complex binds to and inhibits the activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR),[A1321, L19809] which is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase that regulates cell growth, proliferation, survival, mobility, and angiogenesis.[A1320, A1321] mTOR regulates the downstream signalling pathways involved in cell survival, such as the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signalling pathway.[A1320] Inhibition of mTOR leads to the suppression of cytokine-driven T-cell proliferation, thus the progression from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle is inhibited. Sirolimus also inhibits antibody production. _In vitro_, sirolimus and other mTOR inhibitors inhibit the production of certain growth factors that may affect angiogenesis, fibroblast proliferation, and vascular permeability.[L19809]     Lymphangioleiomyomatosis is a disorder that primarily affects the lungs. It is characterized by lung tissue infiltration, unregulated alveolar smooth muscle proliferation, and cystic destruction of parenchyma. Although infrequent, it occurs as a symptomatic pulmonary complication in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), which is an inherited disorder caused by mutations in TSC genes.[A242437] Loss of functional TSC gene leads to the aberrant activation of the mTOR signalling pathway, resulting in cellular proliferation and release of lymphangiogenic growth factors. Sirolimus inhibits the activated mTOR pathway and proliferation of alveolar smooth muscle cell proliferation.[L19809]"

Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of  lactic acidosis and hepatomegaly with steatosis.[L9019]Emtricitabine is a cytidine analog which, when phosphorylated to emtricitabine 5'-triphosphate, competes with deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate for HIV-1 reverse transcriptase.[L9019] As HIV-1 reverse transcriptase incorporates emtricitabine into forming DNA strands, new nucleotides are unable to be incorporated, leading to  viral DNA chain termination.[L9019] Inhibition of reverse transcriptase prevents transcription of viral RNA into DNA, therefore the virus is unable to incorporate its DNA into host DNA and replicate using host cell machinery. This reduces viral load.[A187688]"
560,"Chlorothiazide is indicated as adjunctive therapy in edema associated with congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, and corticosteroid and estrogen therapy. It is also indicated in the management of hypertension either as the sole therapeutic agent or to enhance the effectiveness of other antihypertensive drugs in the more severe forms of hypertension.A thiazide diuretic with actions and uses similar to those of hydrochlorothiazide. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p812)Like other thiazides, chlorothiazide promotes water loss from the body (diuretics). It inhibits Na+/Cl- reabsorption from the distal convoluted tubules in the kidneys. Thiazides also cause loss of potassium and an increase in serum uric acid. Thiazides are often used to treat hypertension, but their hypotensive effects are not necessarily due to their diuretic activity. Thiazides have been shown to prevent hypertension-related morbidity and mortality although the mechanism is not fully understood. Thiazides cause vasodilation by activating calcium-activated potassium channels (large conductance) in vascular smooth muscles and inhibiting various carbonic anhydrases in vascular tissue. Chlorothiazide affects the distal renal tubular mechanism of electrolyte reabsorption. At maximal therapeutic dosages, all thiazides are approximately equal in their diuretic efficacy. Chlorothiazide increases excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Natriuresis may be accompanied by some loss of potassium and bicarbonate. After oral doses, 10-15 percent of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Chlorothiazide crosses the placental but not the blood-brain barrier and is excreted in breast milk.As a diuretic, chlorothiazide inhibits active chloride reabsorption at the early distal tubule via the Na-Cl cotransporter, resulting in an increase in the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water. Thiazides like chlorothiazide also inhibit sodium ion transport across the renal tubular epithelium through binding to the thiazide sensitive sodium-chloride transporter. This results in an increase in potassium excretion via the sodium-potassium exchange mechanism. The antihypertensive mechanism of chlorothiazide is less well understood although it may be mediated through its action on carbonic anhydrases in the smooth muscle or through its action on the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (KCa) channel, also found in the smooth muscle."
561,"Quinapril is indicated for the treatment of hypertension and as an adjunct therapy in the treatment of heart failure.[L8420] Quinapril in combination with hydrochlorothiazide is indicated for the treatment of hypertension.[L8423]Quinapril is the ethyl ester prodrug of the non-sulfhydryl angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor quinaprilat.[L8420,L8423] It is used to treat hypertension and heart failure.[L8420,L8423] ACE inhibitors are commonly used as a first line therapy in the treatment of hypertension, along with thiazide diuretics or beta blockers.[A184844]    Quinapril was granted FDA approval on 19 November 1991.[L8420] A combination tablet with [hydrochlorothiazide] was also approved on 28 December 1999.[L8423]Quinapril is a prodrug of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor used in the treatment of hypertension or adjunct in the treatment of heart failure.[A1329,A1331,L8420] Quinapril has a wide therapeutic window and a long duration of action as it is given in doses of 10-80mg once daily.[L8420]Angiotensin II constricts coronary blood vessels and is positively inotropic, which under normal circumstances, would increase vascular resistance and oxygen consumption.[A184781] This action can eventually lead to myocyte hypertrophy and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation.[A184781] Angiotensin II also stimulates production of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), increasing the risk of thrombosis.[A1331]    Quinaprilat prevents the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II by inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme, and also reduces the breakdown of bradykinin.[A1329,A1331] Reduced levels of angiotensin II lead to lower levels of PAI-1, reducing the risk of thrombosis, especially after a myocardial infarction.[A1331]"
562,"Used mainly in female infertility due to anovulation (e.g. due to polycystic ovary syndrome) to induce ovulation. A triphenyl ethylene stilbene derivative which is an estrogen agonist or antagonist depending on the target tissue.Clomifene (previously clomiphene) is an orally administered, non steroidal, ovulatory stimulant that acts as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). Clomifene can lead to multiple ovulation, and hence increase the risk of conceiving twins. In comparison to purified FSH, the rate of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is low. There may be an increased risk of ovarian cancer and weight gain. Clomifene is capable of interacting with estrogen-receptor-containing tissues, including the hypothalamus, pituitary, ovary, endometrium, vagina, and cervix. It may compete with estrogen for estrogen-receptor-binding sites and may delay replenishment of intracellular estrogen receptors. Clomifene initiates a series of endocrine events culminating in a preovulatory gonadotropin surge and subsequent follicular rupture. The first endocrine event, in response to a course of clomifene therapy, is an increase in the release of pituitary gonadotropins. This initiates steroidogenesis and folliculogenesis resulting in growth of the ovarian follicle and an increase in the circulating level of estradiol. Following ovulation, plasma progesterone and estradiol rise and fall as they would in a normal ovulatory cycle.Clomifene has both estrogenic and anti-estrogenic properties, but its precise mechanism of action has not been determined. Clomifene appears to stumulate the release of gonadotropins, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and leuteinizing hormone (LH), which leads to the development and maturation of ovarian follicle, ovulation, and subsequent development and function of the coprus luteum, thus resulting in pregnancy. Gonadotropin release may result from direct stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis or from a decreased inhibitory influence of estrogens on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis by competing with the endogenous estrogens of the uterus, pituitary, or hypothalamus. Clomifene has no apparent progestational, androgenic, or antrandrogenic effects and does not appear to interfere with pituitary-adrenal or pituitary-thyroid function."
563,"For the prevention of angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease.A vasodilator used in the treatment of angina pectoris. Its actions are similar to nitroglycerin but with a slower onset of action.Isosorbide Dinitrate is a moderate to long acting oral organic nitrate used for the relief and prophylactic management of angina pectoris. It relaxes the vascular smooth muscle and consequent dilatation of peripheral arteries and veins, especially the latter. Dilatation of the veins promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end- diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance, systolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure.Isosorbide dinitrate is converted to the active nitric oxide to activate guanylate cyclase. This activation increases levels of cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP). cGMP activates protein kinases and causes a series of phosphorylation reactions which leads to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains of smooth muscle fibres. Finally there is a release of calcium ions which causes smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation."
564,"Risedronic acid is indicated for the treatment of osteoperosis in men, treatment of Paget's disease, treatment and prevention of osteoperosis in postmenopausal women, and treatment and prevention of glucocorticoid-induced osteoperosis[FDA Label].Risedronic acid is a third generation bisphosphonate that is used for the treatment of some forms of osteoperosis and Paget's disease[FDA Label][A959,A203111]. It functions by preventing resorption of bone[FDA Label][A959].Risedronate is a pyridine-based bisphosphonate that inhibits bone resorption caused by osteoclasts[FDA Label].Risedronatic acid binds to bone hydroxyapatite[FDA Label]. Bone resorption causes local acidification, releasing risedronic acid which is that taken into osteoclasts by fluid-phase endocytosis[A959]. Endocytic vesicles are acidified, releasing risedronic acid to the cytosol of osteoclasts where they induce apoptosis through inhbition of farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase[A959]. Inhibition of osteoclasts results in decreased bone resorption[A959]."
565,"For the treatment of edema associated with congestive heart failure, hepatic and renal disease including the nephrotic syndrome.Bumetanide  is a sulfamyl diuretic.Bumetanide is a loop diuretic of the sulfamyl category to treat heart failure. It is often used in patients in whom high doses of furosemide are ineffective. There is however no reason not to use bumetanide as a first choice drug. The main difference between the two substances is in bioavailability. Bumetanide has more predictable pharmacokinetic properties as well as clinical effect. In patients with normal renal function, bumetanide is 40 times more effective than furosemide.Bumetanide interferes with renal cAMP and/or inhibits the sodium-potassium ATPase pump. Bumetanide appears to block the active reabsorption of chloride and possibly sodium in the ascending loop of Henle, altering electrolyte transfer in the proximal tubule. This results in excretion of sodium, chloride, and water and, hence, diuresis."
566,"For the palliative treatment of Hodgkin's disease (Stages III and IV), lymphosarcoma, chronic myelocytic or chronic lymphocytic leukemia, polycythemia vera, mycosis fungoides, and bronchogenic carcinoma. Also for the palliative treatment of metastatic carcinoma resulting in effusion.A vesicant and necrotizing irritant destructive to mucous membranes, mechlorethamine is an alkylating drug. It was formerly used as a war gas. The hydrochloride is used as an antineoplastic in Hodgkin's disease and lymphomas. It causes severe gastrointestinal and bone marrow damage.    The FDA granted marketing approval for the orphan drug Valchlor (mechlorethamine) gel on August 23, 2013 for the topical treatment of stage IA and IB mycosis fungoides-type cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) in patients who have received prior skin-directed therapy. Each tube of Valchlor contains 0.016% of mechlorethamine which is equivalent to 0.02% mechlorethamine HCl.Mechlorethamine also known as mustine, nitrogen mustard, and HN2, is the prototype anticancer chemotherapeutic drug. Successful clinical use of mechlorethamine gave birth to the field of anticancer chemotherapy. The drug is an analogue of mustard gas and was derived from toxic gas warfare research. Mechlorethamine is a nitrogen mustard alkylating agent. Alkylating agents work by three different mechanisms all of which achieve the same end result - disruption of DNA function and cell death.Alkylating agents work by three different mechanisms: 1) attachment of alkyl groups to DNA bases, resulting in the DNA being fragmented by repair enzymes in their attempts to replace the alkylated bases, preventing DNA synthesis and RNA transcription from the affected DNA, 2) DNA damage via the formation of cross-links (bonds between atoms in the DNA) which prevents DNA from being separated for synthesis or transcription, and 3) the induction of mispairing of the nucleotides leading to mutations. Mechlorethamine is cell cycle phase-nonspecific."
567,"For the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of emetogenic cancer therapy (including high dose cisplatin), postoperation, and radiation (including total body irradiation and daily fractionated abdominal radiation).A serotonin receptor (5HT-3 selective) antagonist that has been used as an antiemetic and antinauseant for cancer chemotherapy patients.Granisetron is a selective inhibitor of type 3 serotonergic (5-HT3) receptors. Granisetron has little or no affinity for other serotonin receptors, including 5-HT 1 , 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 1B/C , or 5-HT 2 ; for alpha 1 -, alpha 2 -, or beta-adrenoreceptors; for dopamine D 2 receptors; for histamine H 1 receptors; for benzodiazepine receptors; for picrotoxin receptors; or for opioid receptors. In most human studies, granisetron has had little effect on blood pressure, heart rate, or electrocardiogram (ECG). The drug is structurally and pharmacologically related to ondansetron, another selective inhibitor of 5-HT3 receptors. The serontonin 5-HT3 receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery, and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. The temporal relationship between the emetogenic action of emetogenic drugs and the release of serotonin, as well as the efficacy of antiemetic agents suggest that chemotherapeutic agents release serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine by causing degenerative changes in the GI tract. The serotonin then stimulates the vagal and splanchnic nerve receptors that project to the medullary vomiting center, as well as the 5-HT3 receptors in the area postrema, thus initiating the vomiting reflex, causing nausea and vomiting.Granisetron is a potent, selective antagonist of 5-HT3 receptors. The antiemetic activity of the drug is brought about through the inhibition of 5-HT3 receptors present both centrally (medullary chemoreceptor zone) and peripherally (GI tract). This inhibition of 5-HT3 receptors in turn inhibits the visceral afferent stimulation of the vomiting center, likely indirectly at the level of the area postrema, as well as through direct inhibition of serotonin activity within the area postrema and the chemoreceptor trigger zone."
568,"For the treatment of dermatitis herpetiformis, benign mucous membrane pemphigoid and pyoderma gangrenosumAntibacterial, potentially toxic, and previously used to treat certain skin diseases. No longer prescribed.Sulfapyridine is a sulfonamide antibiotic. The sulfonamides are synthetic bacteriostatic antibiotics with a wide spectrum against most gram-positive and many gram-negative organisms. However, many strains of an individual species may be resistant. Sulfonamides inhibit multiplication of bacteria by acting as competitive inhibitors of <i>p</i>-aminobenzoic acid in the folic acid metabolism cycle. Bacterial sensitivity is the same for the various sulfonamides, and resistance to one sulfonamide indicates resistance to all. Most sulfonamides are readily absorbed orally. However, parenteral administration is difficult, since the soluble sulfonamide salts are highly alkaline and irritating to the tissues. The sulfonamides are widely distributed throughout all tissues. High levels are achieved in pleural, peritoneal, synovial, and ocular fluids. Although these drugs are no longer used to treat meningitis, CSF levels are high in meningeal infections. Their antibacterial action is inhibited by pus.Sulfapyridine is a competitive inhibitor of the bacterial enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase. The inhibited reaction is necessary in these organisms for the synthesis of folic acid by means of processing the substrate para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). Dihydropteroate synthetase activity is vital in the synthesis of folate, and folate is required for cells to make nucleic acids, such as DNA or RNA. So if DNA molecules cannot be built, the cell cannot divide.  "
569,"Used to temporarily numb the front surface of the eye so that the eye pressure can be measured or a foreign body removed.Oxybuprocaine (also known as Benoxinate) is a local anesthetic, which is used especially in ophthalmology and otolaryngology. Oxybuprocaine binds to sodium channels and reversibly stabilizes the neuronal membrane which decreases its permeability to sodium ions.Oxybuprocaine is a local anaesthetic. It may be less irritating than tetracaine, and the onset and duration of action are similar to tetracaine.Oxybuprocaine binds to sodium channel and reversibly stabilizes the neuronal membrane which decreases its permeability to sodium ions. Depolarization of the neuronal membrane is inhibited thereby blocking the initiation and conduction of nerve impulses."
570,"For treatment of patients with documented iron deficiency in whom oral administration is unsatisfactory or impossible. Also used to replenish body iron stores in Non-Dialysis Dependent-Chronic Kidney Disease (NDD-CKD) patients receiving or not receiving erythropoietin and in Hemodialysis Dependent (HDD-CKD) and Peritoneal Dialysis Dependent (PDD-CKD) - Chronic Kidney Disease patients receiving an erythropoietin.Iron dextran is a dark brown, slightly viscous liquid complex of ferric hydroxide and dextran for intravenous or intramuscular use. Iron Dextran is used for the treatment of patients with documented iron deficiency in which oral administration is unsatisfactory or impossible.Iron dextran is a dark brown, slightly viscous sterile liquid complex of ferric hydroxide and dextran for intravenous or intramuscular use. It is for treatment of patients with documented iron deficiency in whom oral administration is unsatisfactory or impossible. Iron is essential to the formation of hemoglobin and to the function and formation of other heme and nonheme compounds. Untreated depletion of iron stores leads to iron-deficient erythropoiesis and, in turn, to iron deficiency anemia.After iron dextran is injected, the circulating iron dextran is removed from the plasma by cells of the reticuloendothelial system, which split the complex into its components of iron and dextran. The iron is immediately bound to the available protein moieties to form hemosiderin or ferritin, the physiological forms of iron, or to a lesser extent to transferrin. This iron which is subject to physiological control replenishes hemoglobin and depleted iron stores."
571,"For the treatment of postoperative inflammation following ocular surgery and in the treatment of anterior uveitis.Rimexolone is a 1% eye drop solution is a glucocorticoid steroid. It is used to treat inflammation in the eye. It is marketed as Vexol.Rimexolone is a glucocorticoid corticosteroid for systemic use. Corticosteroids suppress the inflammatory response to a variety of inciting agents of a mechanical, chemical, or immunological nature. They inhibit edema, cellular infiltration, capillary dilatation, fibroblastic proliferation, deposition of collagen and scar formation associated with inflammation.Rimexolone is a glucocorticoid receptor agonist. The antiinflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition of arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. By binding to the glucocorticoid receptor, this drug ultimately leads to changes in genetic transcription involving the lipocortins and prostaglandins."
572,"For the short-term treatment of insomnia.Withdrawn in the United Kingdom due to risk of psychiatric adverse drug reactions. This drug continues to be available in the U.S. Internationally, triazolam is a Schedule IV drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances.A short-acting benzodiazepine used as a hypnotic agent in the treatment of insomnia. Some countries temporarily withdrew triazolam from the market because of concerns about adverse reactions, mostly psychological, associated with higher dose ranges. Its use at lower doses with appropriate care and labeling has been reaffirmed by the FDA and most other countries. Triazolam has a shorter half-life than chlordiazepoxide, flurazepam, and prazepam and does not generate active metabolites.Benzodiazepines bind nonspecifically to bezodiazepine receptors BNZ1, which mediates sleep, and BNZ2, which affects affects muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, motor coordination, and memory. As benzodiazepine receptors are thought to be coupled to gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptors, this enhances the effects of GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA receptor. Binding of GABA to the site opens the chloride channel, resulting in a hyperpolarized cell membrane that prevents further excitation of the cell."
573,"For therapeutic neurolysis of nerves or ganglia for the relief of intractable chronic pain in such conditions as inoperable cancer and trigeminal neuralgia (tic douloureux), in patients for whom neurosurgical procedures are contraindicated.A clear, colorless liquid rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and distributed throughout the body. It has bactericidal activity and is used often as a topical disinfectant. It is widely used as a solvent and preservative in pharmaceutical preparations as well as serving as the primary ingredient in alcoholic beverages.Alcohol produces injury to cells by dehydration and precipitation of the cytoplasm or protoplasm. This accounts for its bacteriocidal and antifungal action. When alcohol is injected in close proximity to nerve tissues, it produces neuritis and nerve degeneration (neurolysis). Ninety to 98% of ethanol that enters the body is completely oxidized. Ethanol is also used as a cosolvent to dissolve many insoluble drugs and to serve as a mild sedative in some medicinal formulations. Ethanol also binds to GABA, glycine, NMDA receptors and modulates their effects. Ethanol is also metabolised by the hepatic enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase.Ethanol affects the brain’s neurons in several ways. It alters their membranes as well as their ion channels, enzymes, and receptors. Alcohol also binds directly to the receptors for acetylcholine, serotonin, GABA, and the NMDA receptors for glutamate.   The sedative effects of ethanol are mediated through binding to GABA receptors and glycine receptors (alpha 1 and alpha 2 subunits). It also inhibits NMDA receptor functioning. In its role as an anti-infective, ethanol acts as an osmolyte or dehydrating agent that disrupts the osmotic balance across cell membranes."
574,"For use during the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia.Remifentanil (marketed by Abbott as Ultiva) is a potent ultra short-acting synthetic opioid given to patients during surgery for pain relief and adjunctive to an anaesthetic. Remifentanil is a specific mu-type-opioid receptor agonist which means it reduces sympathetic nervous system tone, and causes respiratory depression and analgesia.Remifentanil is an opioid agonist with rapid onset and peak effect and ultra-short duration of action. The opioid activity of remifentanil is antagonized by opioid antagonists such as naloxone. The analgesic effects of remifentanil are rapid in onset and offset. Its effects and side effects are dose dependent and similar to other opioids. Remifentanil in humans has a rapid blood-brain equilibration half-time of 1 &plusmn; 1 minutes (mean &plusmn; SD) and a rapid onset of action.Remifentanil is a &micro;-opioid agonist with rapid onset and peak effect, and short duration of action. The &micro;-opioid activity of remifentanil is antagonized by opioid antagonists such as naloxone."
575,"A dideoxynucleoside compound in which the 3&#39;-hydroxy group on the sugar moiety has been replaced by a hydrogen. This modification prevents the formation of phosphodiester linkages which are needed for the completion of nucleic acid chains. Didanosine is a potent inhibitor of HIV replication, acting as a chain-terminator of viral DNA by binding to reverse transcriptase; ddI is then metabolized to dideoxyadenosine triphosphate, its putative active metabolite.Didanosine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) with activity against Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1). Didanosine is a hypoxanthine attached to the sugar ring, unlike other nucleoside analogues. Didanosine is phosphorylated to active metabolites that compete for incorporation into viral DNA. They inhibit the HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme competitively and act as a chain terminator of DNA synthesis. Didanosine is effective against HIV, and usually used in combination with other antiviral therapy. Switching from long term AZT treatment to didanosine has been shown to be beneficial. Didanosine has weak acid stability and therefore, it is often combined with an antacid.Didanosine (ddI) is metabolized intracellularly by a series of cellular enzymes to its active moiety, dideoxyadenosine triphosphate (ddATP), which inhibits the HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme competitively by competing with natural dATP. It also acts as a chain terminator by its incorporation into viral DNA as the lack of a 3'-OH group in the incorporated nucleoside analogue prevents the formation of the 5' to 3' phosphodiester linkage essential for DNA chain elongation, and therefore, the viral DNA growth is terminated."
576,"Used to dilate air passages in the lungs that have become narrowed as a result of disease or inflammation. It is used in the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).Bitolterol mesylate was used to treat bronchospasms in asthma and COPD. It is a beta-2-adrenergic receptor agonist. Bitolterol was withdrawn from the market by Elan Pharmaceuticals in 2001.Bitolterol, an adrenergic bronchodilator, is a prodrug that widens constricted airways in the lungs by relaxing the smooth muscles that surround the bronchial passages. Bitolterol probably does not affect the inflammation in the lung, such as in bronchitis. Bitolterol is unique in that it is a prodrug because it must first be metabolized by the body before it becomes active.Bitolterol is an adrenergic beta-2 agonist. Asthma results from a narrowing of the bronchial tubes. This narrowing is caused by muscle spasm and inflammation within the bronchial tubes. Agonism of the beta-2 adrenergic receptors by bitolterol leads to a relaxation of the smooth muscles surrounding these airway tubes which then increases the diameter and ease of air flow through the tubes."
577,"For the treatment of high blood pressure and edema caused by diseases like congestive heart failure, liver failure, and kidney failure.A compound that inhibits symport of sodium, potassium, and chloride primarily in the ascending limb of Henle, but also in the proximal and distal tubules. This pharmacological action results in excretion of these ions, increased urinary output, and reduction in extracellular fluid. This compound has been classified as a loop or high ceiling diuretic.Ethacrynic acid is a monosulfonamyl loop or high ceiling diuretic. Ethacrynic acid acts on the ascending limb of the loop of Henle and on the proximal and distal tubules. Urinary output is usually dose dependent and related to the magnitude of fluid accumulation. Water and electrolyte excretion may be increased several times over that observed with thiazide diuretics, since ethacrynic acid inhibits reabsorption of a much greater proportion of filtered sodium than most other diuretic agents. Therefore, ethacrynic acid is effective in many patients who have significant degrees of renal insufficiency. Ethacrynic acid has little or no effect on glomerular filtration or on renal blood flow, except following pronounced reductions in plasma volume when associated with rapid diuresis.Ethacrynic acid inhibits symport of sodium, potassium, and chloride primarily in the ascending limb of Henle, but also in the proximal and distal tubules. This pharmacological action results in excretion of these ions, increased urinary output, and reduction in extracellular fluid. Diuretics also lower blood pressure initially by reducing plasma and extracellular fluid volume; cardiac output also decreases, explaining its antihypertensive action. Eventually, cardiac output returns to normal with an accompanying decrease in peripheral resistance. Its mode of action does not involve carbonic anhydrase inhibition."
578,"In the adult patient population:  i) orally administered ondansetron tablets and orally disintegrating tablets (ODT) are indicated for:  - the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including high dose (ie. greater than or equal to 50 mg/m2) cisplatin therapy, and radiotherapy, and  - the prevention and treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting    ii) intravenously administered ondansetron injection formulations are indicated for:  - the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including high dose (ie. greater than or equal to 50 mg/m2) cisplatin therapy, and  - the prevention and treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting    In the pediatric (4-18 years of age) patient population:  i) ondansetron was effective and well tolerated when given to children 4-12 years of age for the treatment of post-chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting,  ii) ondansetron tablets, ondansetron ODT, ondansetron injection are not indicated for the treatment of children 3 years of age or younger,  iii) ondansetron tablets, ondansetron ODT, ondansetron injection are not indicated for use in any age group of the pediatric population for the treatment of post-radiotherapy induced nausea and vomiting, and  iV) ondansetron tablets, ondansetron ODT, ondansetron injection are not indicated for use in any age group of the pediatric population for the treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting    In the geriatric (>65 years of age) patient population:  i) efficacy and tolerance of ondansetron were similar to that observed in younger adults for the treatment of post-chemotherapy and radiotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and  ii) clinical experience in the use of ondansetron in the prevention and treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting is limited and is not indicated for use in the geriatric patient population A competitive serotonin type 3 receptor antagonist. It is effective in the treatment of nausea and vomiting caused by cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs, including cisplatin, and has reported anxiolytic and neuroleptic properties.    Having been developed in the 1980s by GlaxoSmithKline and approved by the US FDA since January 1991, ondansetron has demonstrated a long history of use and efficacy. Commonly formulated as oral tablets, orally disintegrating tablets (ODT), and injections, and available as generic products as well, ondansetron continues to see contemporary innovations in its formulation and use, including the development of orally soluble films that are both discreet in administration and less of a burden in comparison to having patients attempt to swallow pills during emesis.[L5221]    The FDA withdrew its approval for the use of all intravenous drug products containing more than 16 mg of ondansetron hydrochloride in a single dose, due to a high risk of QT prolongation.[L44067,L43942]Ondansetron is a highly specific and selective serotonin 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist, not shown to have activity at other known serotonin receptors and with low affinity for dopamine receptors [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161]. The serotonin 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery, and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161]. The temporal relationship between the emetogenic action of emetogenic drugs and the release of serotonin, as well as the efficacy of antiemetic agents, suggest that chemotherapeutic agents release serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine by causing degenerative changes in the GI tract [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161]. The serotonin then stimulates the vagal and splanchnic nerve receptors that project to the medullary vomiting center, as well as the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors in the area postrema, thus initiating the vomiting reflex, causing nausea and vomiting [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161].    Moreover, the effect of ondansetron on the QTc interval was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo and positive (moxifloxacin) controlled, crossover study in 58 healthy adult men and women [F3181, F3184]. Ondansetron was tested at single doses of 8 mg and 32 mg infused intravenously over 15 minutes [F3181, F3184]. At the highest tested dose of 32 mg, prolongation of the Fridericia-corrected QTc interval (QT/RR0.33=QTcF) was observed from 15 min to 4 h after the start of the 15 min infusion, with a maximum mean (upper limit of 90% CI) difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline-correction of 19.6 (21.5) msec at 20 min [F3181, F3184]. At the lower tested dose of 8 mg, QTc prolongation was observed from 15 min to 1 h after the start of the 15-minute infusion, with a maximum mean (upper limit of 90% CI) difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline-correction of 5.8 (7.8) msec at 15 min [F3181, F3184]. The magnitude of QTc prolongation with ondansetron is expected to be greater if the infusion rate is faster than 15 minutes [F3181, F3184]. The 32 mg intravenous dose of ondansetron must not be administered [F3181, F3184]. No treatment-related effects on the QRS duration or the PR interval were observed at either the 8 or 32 mg dose [F3181, F3184].    An ECG assessment study has not been performed for orally administered ondansetron [F3181, F3184]. On the basis of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling, an 8 mg oral dose of ondansetron is predicted to cause a mean QTcF increase of 0.7 ms (90% CI -2.1, 3.3) at steady-state, assuming a mean maximal plasma concentration of 24.7 ng/mL (95% CI 21.1, 29.0) [F3181, F3184]. The magnitude of QTc prolongation at the recommended 5 mg/m2 dose in pediatrics has not been studied, but pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling predicts a mean increase of 6.6 ms (90% CI 2.8, 10.7) at maximal plasma concentrations [F3181, F3184].     In healthy subjects, single intravenous doses of 0.15 mg/kg of ondansetron had no effect on esophageal motility, gastric motility, lower esophageal sphincter pressure, or small intestinal transit time [F3178]. Multiday administration of ondansetron has been shown to slow colonic transit in healthy subjects [F3178]. Ondansetron has no effect on plasma prolactin concentrations [F3178].Ondansetron is a selective antagonist of the serotonin receptor subtype, 5-HT3 [F3178, F3181, F3184].    Cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy are associated with the release of serotonin (5-HT) from enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine, presumably initiating a vomiting reflex through stimulation of 5-HT3 receptors located on vagal afferents [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Ondansetron may block the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a central release of serotonin from the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Thus, the antiemetic effect of ondansetron is probably due to the selective antagonism of 5-HT3 receptors on neurons located in either the peripheral or central nervous systems, or both [F3178, F3181, F3184].    Although the mechanisms of action of ondansetron in treating postoperative nausea and vomiting and cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting may share similar pathways, the role of ondansetron in opiate-induced emesis has not yet been formally established [F3181, F3184]."
579,"Bimatoprost is used for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.  These patients must be intolerant to other intraocular pressure lowering medications or inadequately responsive to other treatments.[L6877]    Bimatoprost is also indicated to treat eyelash hypotrichosis.[L6910]Bimatoprost, also known as Latisse or Lumigan, belongs to a group of drugs called prostamides, which are synthetic structural analogs of prostaglandin. Bimatoprost, marketed by Allergan, is administered in both the ophthalmic solution and implant form. It has the ability to reduce ocular hypotension, proving effective in conditions such as ocular hypertension and glaucoma.[L6877,L6892,L6898,L12069] Bimatoprost is also used to treat eyelash hypotrichosis, or sparse eyelash growth.[L6910] It was initially approved by the FDA in 2001 for ocular hypertension and later approved for hypothrichosis in 2008, as eyelash growth became a desirable adverse effect for patients using this drug.[L4894]High intraocular pressure is a major risk factor for glaucoma-related visual field loss. A linear relationship exists between intraocular pressure and the risk of damaging the optic nerve, which can lead to considerable visual impairment.[L6877] Therefore, conditions such as ocular hypertension and glaucoma can cause dangerous elevations of intraocular pressure. Bimatoprost rapidly decreases intraocular pressure and reduces the risk for visual field loss from ocular hypertension due to various causes.[L6877]    Other effects of this drug may include gradual changes in eyelid pigmentation, changes in iris pigmentation, changes in eyelash pigmentation, growth and thickness.[L6877] Patients should be informed of these possible effects, especially if this drug is only administered to one eye, which may noticeably change in appearance with bimatoprost treatment.[L6877]Bimatoprost imitates the effects of prostamides, specifically prostaglandin F2α.[L6892] Bimatoprost mildly stimulates aqueous humor outflow, relieving elevated intraocular pressure and decreasing the risk of optic nerve damage. It is thought that bimatoprost reduces intraocular pressure (IOP) in humans by causing an increase in outflow of the aqueous humor via the trabecular meshwork and uveoscleral pathways.[L6877] It achieves the above effects by decreasing tonographic resistance to aqueous humor outflow.[A1367]  Bimatoprost does not affect aqueous humor production.[A416]"
580,"For the introduction of local (topical) anesthesia of accessible mucous membranes of the oral, laryngeal and nasal cavities.An alkaloid ester extracted from the leaves of plants including coca. It is a local anesthetic and vasoconstrictor and is clinically used for that purpose, particularly in the eye, ear, nose, and throat. It also has powerful central nervous system effects similar to the amphetamines and is a drug of abuse. Cocaine, like amphetamines, acts by multiple mechanisms on brain catecholaminergic neurons; the mechanism of its reinforcing effects is thought to involve inhibition of dopamine uptake.Cocaine is a local anesthetic indicated for the introduction of local (topical) anesthesia of accessible mucous membranes of the oral, laryngeal and nasal cavities.Cocaine produces anesthesia by inhibiting excitation of nerve endings or by blocking conduction in peripheral nerves. This is achieved by reversibly binding to and inactivating sodium channels. Sodium influx through these channels is necessary for the depolarization of nerve cell membranes and subsequent propagation of impulses along the course of the nerve. Cocaine is the only local anesthetic with vasoconstrictive properties. This is a result of its blockade of norepinephrine reuptake in the autonomic nervous system. Cocaine binds differentially to the dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine transport proteins and directly prevents the re-uptake of dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine into pre-synaptic neurons. Its effect on dopamine levels is most responsible for the addictive property of cocaine."
581,"Quinidine is indicated for the management and prophylactic therapy of atrial fibrillation/flutter, as well as the suppression of recurrent documented ventricular arrhythmias.[L42420,L3719] It is also used in the treatment of Brugada syndrome, short QT syndrome and idiopathic ventricular fibrillation.[A250050,A250055].Quinidine is a D-isomer of [quinine] present in the bark of the Cinchona tree and similar plant species. This alkaloid was first described in 1848 and has a long history as an antiarrhythmic medication.[A38016,A250050] Quinidine is considered the first antiarrhythmic drug (class Ia) and is moderately efficacious in the acute conversion of atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm.[A38016] It prolongs cellular action potential by blocking sodium and potassium currents. A phenomenon known as “quinidine syncope” was first described in the 1950s, characterized by syncopal attacks and ventricular fibrillation in patients treated with this drug.[A38016] Due to its side effects and increased risk of mortality, the use of quinidine was reduced over the next few decades. However, it continues to be used in the treatment of Brugada syndrome, short QT syndrome and idiopathic ventricular fibrillation.[A250050]Quinidine is an antimalarial schizonticide, and a class Ia antiarrhythmic agent used to interrupt or prevent reentrant arrhythmias and arrhythmias due to increased automaticity, such as atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.[L3719] In most patients, quinidine can lead to an increase in the sinus rate. Quinidine also causes a marked prolongation of the QT interval in a dose-related manner,[A38016,L42420] acts peripherally as an α-adrenergic antagonist, and has anticholinergic and negative inotropic activity.[L3719]    The QT interval prolongation caused by quinidine can lead to increased ventricular automaticity and polymorphic ventricular tachycardias, such as _torsades de pointes_. The risk of _torsades_ is increased by bradycardia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia or high serum levels of quinidine. However, this type of rhythm disturbance may appear in the absence of any of them.[L42420,L3719] Patients treated with quinidine may also be at risk of a paradoxical increase in ventricular rate in atrial flutter/fibrillation, and patients with sick sinus syndrome treated with quinidine may develop marked sinus node depression and bradycardia.[L42420,L3719]Quinidine has a complex electrophysiological profile that has not been fully elucidated. The antiarrhythmic actions of this drug are mediated through effects on sodium channels in Purkinje fibers. Quinidine blocks the rapid sodium channel (INa), decreasing the phase zero of rapid depolarization of the action potential.[A250050] Quinidine also reduces repolarizing K+ currents (IKr, IKs), the inward rectifier potassium current (IK1), and the transient outward potassium current Ito, as well as the L-type calcium current ICa and the late INa inward current.[A250050] The reduction of these currents leads to the prolongation of the action potential duration. By shortening the plateau but prolonging late depolarization, quinidine facilitates the formation of early afterdepolarisation (EAD).[A250050] Additionally, in patients with malaria, quinidine acts primarily as an intra-erythrocytic schizonticide, and is gametocidal to _Plasmodium vivax_ and _P. malariae_, but not to _P. falciparum_.[L42420,L3719]"
582,"Zonisamide capsules are indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial seizures in adults with epilepsy.[L42530] Zonisamide oral suspension is indicated as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in adults and pediatric patients 16 years of age and older.[L42535]Zonisamide is a sulfonamide anticonvulsant used as an adjunctive therapy in adults with partial-onset seizures.[L42530,L42535]  Zonisamide may act by blocking repetitive firing of voltage-gated sodium channels, leading to a reduction of T-type calcium channel currents or by binding allosterically to GABA receptors. This latter action may inhibit the uptake of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA while enhancing the uptake of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate.[L42530,L42535] Zonisamide represents an alternative for patients that remain refractory to established antiepileptic drugs. In 1989, it was approved for commercial use in Japan. The US and Europe approved it in 2000 and 2005, respectively.[A1379,A1383]By stopping the spread of seizure discharges, zonisamide prevents the extensor component of tonic convulsion, restricts the spread of focal seizures and prevents the propagation of seizures from the cortex to subcortical structures.[A1383,A1384] In animal models, zonisamide was effective against tonic extension seizures but ineffective against clonic seizures. It also increased the threshold for generalized seizures and reduced the duration of cortical focal seizures.[L42530] Aside from its antiepileptic effects, zonisamide is capable of activating neuroprotective mechanisms. It inhibits nitric oxide synthase and ​​reduces ischemia-induced memory impairment and lipid peroxidation.[A1383]    The use of zonisamide may lead to potentially fatal reactions. Severe reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, fulminant hepatic necrosis, agranulocytosis, and aplastic anemia have been reported in patients treated with sulfonamides such as zonisamide. Zonisamide may also lead to the development of serious hematological events, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and multi-organ hypersensitivity, acute myopia and secondary angle closure glaucoma, as well as suicidal behaviour and ideation.[L42530,L42535] Zonisamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, which may lead to metabolic acidosis in patients treated with this drug. Its therapeutic effects due to this pharmacological action are unknown.[L42530]The mechanism of action by which zonisamide controls seizures has not been fully established. However, its antiepileptic properties may be due to its effects on sodium and calcium channels.[L42530,L42535] Zonisamide blocks sodium channels and reduces voltage-dependent, transient inward currents, stabilizing neuronal membranes and suppressing neuronal hypersynchronization.[L42530,L42535] It affects T-type calcium currents, but has no effect on L-type calcium currents.[A1382,A1383,A1385]     Zonisamide suppresses synaptically-driven electrical activity by altering the synthesis, release, and degradation of neurotransmitters, such as glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), dopamine, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]), and acetylcholine.[A1383,A1380] Furthermore, it binds to the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor ionophore complex without producing changes in chloride flux.[L42530,L42535] _In vitro_ studies have suggested that zonisamide does not affect postsynaptic GABA or glutamate responses, nor the neuronal or glial uptake of [<sup>3</sup>H]-GABA."
583,"For treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) Stage 3 and 4Paricalcitol is a synthetic vitamin D analog. Paricalcitol has been used to reduce parathyroid hormone levels. Paricalcitol is indicated for the prevention and treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with chronic renal failure.Secondary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by an elevation in parathyroid hormone (PTH) associated with inadequate levels of active vitamin D hormone. The source of vitamin D in the body is from synthesis in the skin and from dietary intake. Vitamin D requires two sequential hydroxylations in the liver and the kidney to bind to and to activate the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The endogenous VDR activator, calcitriol [1,25(OH)2 D3], is a hormone that binds to VDRs that are present in the parathyroid gland, intestine, kidney, and bone to maintain parathyroid function and calcium and phosphorus homeostasis, and to VDRs found in many other tissues, including prostate, endothelium and immune cells. VDR activation is essential for the proper formation and maintenance of normal bone. In the diseased kidney, the activation of vitamin D is diminished, resulting in a rise of PTH, subsequently leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism and disturbances in the calcium and phosphorus homeostasis.1 Decreased levels of 1,25(OH)2 D3 have been observed in early stages of chronic kidney disease. The decreased levels of 1,25(OH)2 D3 and resultant elevated PTH levels, both of which often precede abnormalities in serum calcium and phosphorus, affect bone turnover rate and may result in renal osteodystrophy. An in vitro study indicates that paricalcitol is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 or CYP3A at concentrations up to 50 nM (21 ng/mL).Paricalcitol is a synthetic, biologically active vitamin D analog of calcitriol with modifications to the side chain (D2) and the A (19-nor) ring. Preclinical andin vitro studies have demonstrated that paricalcitol's biological actions are mediated through binding of the VDR, which results in the selective activation of vitamin D responsive pathways. Vitamin D and paricalcitol have been shown to reduce parathyroid hormone levels by inhibiting PTH synthesis and secretion."
584,"For the treatment of trichomoniasis caused by T. vaginalis in both female and male patients. Also for the treatment of giardiasis caused by G. duodenalis in both adults and pediatric patients older than three years of age and for the treatment of intestinal amebiasis and amebic liver abscess caused by E. histolytica in both adults and pediatric patients older than three years of age.A nitroimidazole antitrichomonal agent effective against _Trichomonas vaginalis_, _Entamoeba histolytica_, and _Giardia lamblia_ infections.Tinidazole is a synthetic antiprotozoal agent. Tinidazole demonstrates activity both in vitro and in clinical infections against the following protozoa: Trichomonas vaginalis, Giardia duodenalis (also termed G. lamblia), and Entamoeba histolytica. Tinidazole does not appear to have activity against most strains of vaginal lactobacilli.Tinidazole is a prodrug and antiprotozoal agent. The nitro group of tinidazole is reduced in Trichomonas by a ferredoxin-mediated electron transport system. The free nitro radical generated as a result of this reduction is believed to be responsible for the antiprotozoal activity. It is suggested that the toxic free radicals covalently bind to DNA, causing DNA damage and leading to cell death. The mechanism by which tinidazole exhibits activity against Giardia and Entamoeba species is not known, though it is probably similar."
585,"As an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Repaglinide is an oral antihyperglycemic agent used for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It belongs to the meglitinide class of short-acting insulin secretagogues, which act by binding to β cells of the pancreas to stimulate insulin release. Repaglinide induces an early insulin response to meals decreasing postprandial blood glucose levels. It should only be taken with meals and meal-time doses should be skipped with any skipped meal. Approximately one month of therapy is required before a decrease in fasting blood glucose is seen. Meglitnides may have a neutral effect on weight or cause a slight increase in weight. The average weight gain caused by meglitinides appears to be lower than that caused by sulfonylureas and insulin and appears to occur only in those naïve to oral antidiabetic agents. Due to their mechanism of action, meglitinides may cause hypoglycemia although the risk is thought to be lower than that of sulfonylureas since their action is dependent on the presence of glucose. In addition to reducing postprandial and fasting blood glucose, meglitnides have been shown to decrease glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, which are reflective of the last 8-10 weeks of glucose control. Meglitinides appear to be more effective at lowering postprandial blood glucose than metformin, sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones. Repaglinide is extensively metabolized in the liver and excreted in bile. Repaglinide metabolites do not possess appreciable hypoglycemic activity. Approximately 90% of a single orally administered dose is eliminated in feces and 8% in urine.Insulin secretion by pancreatic &beta; cells is partly controlled by cellular membrane potential. Membrane potential is regulated through an inverse relationship between the activity of cell membrane ATP-sensitive potassium channels (ABCC8) and extracellular glucose concentrations. Extracellular glucose enters the cell via GLUT2 (SLC2A2) transporters. Once inside the cell, glucose is metabolized to produce ATP. High concentrations of ATP inhibit ATP-sensitive potassium channels causing membrane depolarization. When extracellular glucose concentrations are low, ATP-sensitive potassium channels open causing membrane repolarization. High glucose concentrations cause ATP-sensitive potassium channels to close resulting in membrane depolarization and opening of L-type calcium channels. The influx of calcium ions stimulates calcium-dependent exocytosis of insulin granules. Repaglinide increases insulin release by inhibiting ATP-sensitive potassium channels in a glucose-dependent manner. Repaglinide activity is dependent on the presence functioning &beta; cells and glucose. In contrast to sulfonylurea insulin secretatogogues, repaglinide has no effect on insulin release in the absence of glucose. Rather, it potentiates the effect of extracellular glucose on ATP-sensitive potassium channel and has little effect on insulin levels between meals and overnight. As such, repaglinide is more effective at reducing postprandial blood glucose levels than fasting blood glucose levels and requires a longer duration of therapy (approximately one month) before decreases in fasting blood glucose are observed. The insulinotropic effects of repaglinide are highest at intermediate glucose levels (3 to 10 mmol/L) and it does not increase insulin release already stimulated by high glucose concentrations (greater than 15 mmol/L). Repaglinide appears to be selective for pancreatic &beta; cells and does not appear to affect skeletal or cardiac muscle or thyroid tissue. "
586,"For treatment and management of pain (systemic) and for use as an anesthesia adjunct.Anileridine is a synthetic opioid and strong analgesic medication. It is a narcotic pain reliever used to treat moderate to severe pain. Narcotic analgesics act in the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain. Some of their side effects are also caused by actions in the CNS.Anileridine, a potent analgesic, is an analog of pethidine. Anileridine is useful for the relief of moderate to severe pain. It may also be used as an analgesic adjunct in general anesthesia in the same manner as meperidine to reduce the amount of anesthetic needed, to facilitate relaxation, and to reduce laryngospasm. In addition, anileridine exerts mild antihistaminic, spasmolytic and antitussive effects. Anileridine's main pharmacologic action is exerted on the CNS. Respiratory depression, when it occurs, is of shorter duration than that seen with morphine or meperidine when equipotent analgesic doses are used.Opiate receptors are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as both positive and negative regulators of synaptic transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine and noradrenaline is inhibited. Opioids also inhibit the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin and glucagon. Opioids such as anileridine close N-type voltage-operated calcium channels (OP2-receptor agonist) and open calcium-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channels (OP3 and OP1 receptor agonist). This results in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability."
587,"For the reatment of type II diabetes mellitus.A biguanide hypoglycemic agent with actions and uses similar to those of metformin. Although it is generally considered to be associated with an unacceptably high incidence of lactic acidosis, often fatal, it is still available in some countries. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p290)Used to treat diabetes, phenformin is a biguanide (contains 2 guanidino groups) hypoglycemic agent with actions and uses similar to those of metformin (Glucophage). Both drugs work by (1) decreasing the absorption of glucose by the intestines, (2) decreasing the production of glucose in the liver, and by (3) increasing the body's ability to use insulin more effectively. More specifically, phenformin improves glycemic control by improving insulin sensitivity. Phenformin is generally considered to be associated with an unacceptably high incidence of actic acidosis. In general biguanides should be used only in stable type II diabetics who are free of liver, kidney and cardiovascular problems and who cannot be controlled with diet.Phenformin binds to the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK is an ultra-sensitive cellular energy sensor that monitors energy consumption and down-regulates ATP-consuming processes when activated. The biguanide phenformin has been shown to independently decrease ion transport processes, influence cellular metabolism and activate AMPK. Phenformin's hypoglycemic activity is related the effect it has in activating AMPK and fooling insulin sensitive cells into thinking that insulin levels are low and causing the body to use glucose as if in a state of low caloric consumption. This drug also seems to inhibit several varients of ATP-sensitive potassium channels (namely the receptor subtype Kir6.1)."
588,"Metronidazole is indicated for the treatment of confirmed trichomoniasis caused by Trichomonas vaginalis (except for in the first trimester of pregnancy) and the patient's sexual partners, bacterial vaginosis,[L7432, L49811] certain types of amebiasis, and various anaerobic infections.[A181057, L49811] The above anaerobic infections may occur on the skin and skin structures, the abdomen, the heart, reproductive organs, central nervous system, and the respiratory system. Some may also be present in the bloodstream in cases of septicemia. Common infections treated by metronidazole are Bacteroides species infections, Clostridium infections, and Fusobacterium infections, as well as Peptococcus and Peptostreptococcus infections.[L3754] Topical formulations of metronidazole are indicated for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea.[L45166]    It is also used off-label in the treatment of Crohn's disease, as a prophylactic agent after surgery[A181039], and in the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection.[A181045] It has also been studied in the prevention of preterm births and to treat periodontal disease.[A1391,A181078]Metronidazole is a commonly used antibiotic, belonging to the nitroimidazole class of antibiotics.[L3754] It is frequently used to treat gastrointestinal infections as well as trichomoniasis and giardiasis, and amebiasis which are parasitic infections.[A181036,A181039] Metronidazole has been used as an antibiotic for several decades[L7429], with added antiparasitic properties that set it apart from many other antibacterial drugs, allowing it to treat a wide variety of infections. It is available in capsule form, tablet form, and topical form, and suppository preparations for the treatment of various infections.Metronidazole treats amebiasis, trichomoniasis, and giardiasis, exerting both antibacterial and antiprotozoal activities.[L7432] Metronidazole is an effective treatment for some anaerobic bacterial infections.[A181057] Metronidazole has shown antibacterial activity against the majority of obligate anaerobes, however, during in vitro studies, it does not demonstrate significant action against facultative anaerobes or obligate aerobes.[L3754] The nitro group reduction of metronidazole by anaerobic organisms is likely responsible for the drug's antimicrobial cytotoxic effects, causing DNA strand damage to microbes.[A181039,A181045]    A note on convulsions and neuropathy and carcinogenesis    It is important to be aware of the risk of peripheral neuropathy and convulsions associated with metronidazole, especially at higher doses. If convulsions or numbness of an extremity occur, discontinue the drug immediately.[L3754] Metronidazole has been found to be carcinogenic in mice and rats. The relevance to this effect in humans is unknown. It is advisable to only administer metronidazole when clinically necessary and only for its approved indications.[L7474]The exact mechanism of action of metronidazole has not been fully established, however, it is possible that an intermediate in the reduction of metronidazole which is only made by anaerobic bacteria and protozoa, binds deoxyribonucleic acid and electron-transport proteins of organisms, blocking nucleic acid synthesis.[L3754]  After administration, metronidazole enters cells by passive diffusion. Following this, ferredoxin or flavodoxin reduce its nitro group to nitro radicals.  The redox potential of the electron transport portions of anaerobic or microaerophilic microorganisms renders metronidazole selective to these organisms, which cause nitro group reduction, leading to the production of toxic metabolites. These include N-(2-hydroxyethyl) oxamic acid and acetamide, which may damage DNA of replicating organisms.[A181039]"
589,"For the termination of pregnancy during the second trimester (from the 12th through the 20th gestational week as calculated from the first day of the last normal menstrual period), as well as for evacuation of the uterine contents in the management of missed abortion or intrauterine fetal death up to 28 weeks of gestational age as calculated from the first day of the last normal menstrual period. Also used in the management of nonmetastatic gestational trophoblastic disease (benign hydatidiform mole). Other indications include improving the cervical inducibility (cervical ""ripening"") in pregnant women at or near term with a medical or obstetrical need for labor induction, and the management of postpartum hemorrhage.Dinoprostone is a naturally occurring prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). It has important effects in labour. It also stimulates osteoblasts to release factors which stimualtes bone resorption by osteoclasts. As a prescription drug it is used as a vaginal suppository, to prepare the cervix for labour and to induce labour.Dinoprostone is equivalent to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). It stimulates labor and delivery by stimulating the uterine, and thus terminates pregnancy. Dinoprostone is also capable of stimulating the smooth muscle of the gastrointestinal tract of man. This activity may be responsible for the vomiting and/or diarrhea that is not uncommon when dinoprostone is used to terminate pregnancy.Dinoprostone administered intravaginally stimulates the myometrium of the gravid uterus to contract in a manner that is similar to the contractions seen in the term uterus during labor, resulting in the evacuation of the products of conception from the uterus. It is believed that dinoprostone exerts its uterine effects via direct myometrial stimulation, but the exact mechanism of action is unkown. Other suggested mechanisms include the regulation of cellular membrane calcium transport and of intracellular concentrations of cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate. Dinoprostone also appears to produce local cervical effects including softening, effacement, and dilation. The exact mechanism of action for this effect is also unknown, but it has been suggested that this effect may be associated with collagen degradation caused by secretion of the enzyme collagenase as a partial response to locally administered dinoprostone."
590,"Administered orally, ketotifen is indicated as an add-on medication in the chronic treatment of mild atopic asthma in children.[L32283] It is also available as an over-the-counter ophthalmic solution which is indicated for the temporary prevention of itching of the eye due to allergic conjunctivitis.[L32278]Ketotifen is a benzocycloheptathiophene derivative[A231204] with potent antihistaminic and mast cell stabilizing properties. It has a similar structure to some other first-generation antihistamines such as [cyproheptadine] and [azatadine].[A231204]    Ketotifen was first developed in Switzerland in 1970 by Sandoz Pharmaceuticals and was initially marketed for the treatment of anaphylaxis.[A231204] In the US, it is now used in an over-the-counter ophthalmic formulation for the treatment of itchy eyes associated with allergies,[L32278] and in Canada a prescription-only oral formulation is available and indicated as an add-on therapy for children with atopic asthma.[L32283] In addition, oral ketotifen is used in Mexico and across Europe for the treatment of various allergic symptoms and disorders,[A231204] including urticaria, mastocytosis, and food allergy.Ketotifen is a non-competitive histamine antagonist and mast cell stabilizer.[L32278] Administered orally, it functions as a non-bronchodilator antiasthmatic drug by inhibiting the effects of endogenous substances known to be inflammatory mediators.[L32283] While effects can take 6 to 12 weeks to become apparent,[A231214] the use of ketotifen has been demonstrated to reduce the frequency, severity, and duration of asthma symptoms, and may allow for a reduction in the use of other asthma therapies.[L32283]The precise mechanism(s) through which ketotifen exerts its therapeutic effects are unclear. Ketotifen is a potent and non-competitive antagonist of H1 histamine receptors, which is likely to be a significant contributor to its anti-allergic activity.[L32283] In addition, ketotifen stabilizes mast cells and has demonstrated _in vitro_ the ability to inhibit the release of allergic and inflammatory mediators such as histamine, leukotrienes C<sub>4</sub> and D<sub>4</sub> (i.e. SRS-A), and platelet-activating factor (PAF).[L32283]    Other _in vivo_ observations thought to contribute to ketotifen's efficacy in asthma include the inhibition of various PAF-mediated processes (e.g. airway hyperreactivity, eosinophil and platelet accumulation in the airways), prevention of leukotriene-induced bronchoconstriction, and suppression of eosinophil priming.[L32283]"
591,"The buccal film, intramuscular or intravenous injection, and transdermal formulation are indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternate treatments are inadequate.[L46566, L46576, L46581]    The extended-release subcutaneous injections of buprenorphine are indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe opioid use disorder in patients who have initiated treatment with a single dose of a transmucosal buprenorphine product or who are already being treated with buprenorphine. Injections are part of a complete treatment plan that includes counselling and psychosocial support.[L42285, L46571]Buprenorphine is a weak partial mu-opioid receptor agonist and a weak kappa-opioid receptor antagonist used for the treatment of severe pain.[A186283,A186292] It is also commonly used as an alternative to [methadone] for the treatment of severe opioid addiction. [A186289,L46571] Buprenorphine has poor gastrointestinal absorption and is therefore formulated as a sublingual tablet.    Buprenorphine has a number of unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that make it a preferred agent for the treatment of conditions requiring high doses of strong opioids.[A186286] For example, buprenorphine dissociates from opioid receptors very slowly, resulting in a long duration of action and relief from pain or withdrawal symptoms for upwards of 24-36 hours. Use of once-daily buprenorphine may benefit individuals who have developed tolerance to other potent opioids and who require larger and more frequent doses. Buprenorphine may also be a preferred agent over [methadone] (which is also commonly used to treat severe pain and opioid use disorder), as it has less effect on Qtc interval prolongation,[A186271,A186274] fewer drug interactions, reduced risk of sexual side effects,[A186298] and an improved safety profile with a lower risk of overdose and respiratory depression.[A186263,A186266,A186269]    Buprenorphine acts as a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist with a high affinity for the receptor, but lower intrinsic activity compared to other full mu-opioid agonists such as [heroin], [oxycodone], or [methadone].[A186292] This means that buprenorphine preferentially binds the opioid receptor and displaces lower affinity opioids without activating the receptor to a comparable degree. Clinically, this results in a slow onset of action and a clinical phenomenon known as the ""ceiling effect"" where once a certain dose is reached, buprenorphine's effects plateau. This effect can be beneficial, however, as dose-related side effects such as respiratory depression, sedation, and intoxication also plateau at around 32mg, resulting in a lower risk of overdose compared to [methadone] and other full agonist opioids.[A186215,A186218] It also means that opioid-dependent patients do not experience sedation or euphoria at the same rate that they might experience with more potent opioids, improving quality of life for patients with severe pain and reducing the reinforcing effects of opioids which can lead to drug-seeking behaviours.[A186280]    Treatment of opioid addiction with buprenorphine, [methadone], or slow-release oral [morphine] (SROM) is termed Opioid Agonist Treatment (OAT) or Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST). The intention of substitution of illicit opioids with the long-acting opioids used in OAT is to prevent withdrawal symptomns for 24-36 hours following dosing to ultimately reduce cravings and drug-seeking behaviours. Use of OAT is also intended to improved social stabilization including a reduction in crime rates, marginalization, incarceration, and use of illicit substances such as [heroin] or [fentanyl]. Illegally purchased opioids can often be injected and may be laced with other substances that increase the risk of harm or overdose. Provision of OAT is often combined with education about harm reduction including use of clean needles and injection supplies in an effort to reduce the risks associated with injection drug use which includes contraction of HIV and Hepatitis C and other complications including skin infections, abscesses, or endocarditis.[A186295]Buprenorphine interacts predominately with the opioid mu-receptor. These mu-binding sites are discretely distributed in the human brain, spinal cord, and other tissues. In clinical settings, buprenorphine exerts its principal pharmacologic effects on the central nervous system. Its primary actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation. In addition to analgesia, alterations in mood, euphoria and dysphoria, and drowsiness commonly occur. Buprenorphine depresses the respiratory centers, depresses the cough reflex, and constricts the pupils.       **Dependence**    Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and chronic administration produces physical dependence of the opioid type, characterized by withdrawal signs and symptoms upon abrupt discontinuation or rapid taper. The withdrawal syndrome is typically milder than seen with full agonists and may be delayed in onset. Buprenorphine can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing buprenorphine in situations when the clinician is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion.[F4718]      **Withdrawal**    Abrupt discontinuation of treatment is not recommended as it may result in an opioid withdrawal syndrome that may be delayed in onset. Signs and symptoms may include body aches, diarrhea, gooseflesh, loss of appetite, nausea, nervousness or restlessness, anxiety, runny nose, sneezing, tremors or shivering, stomach cramps, tachycardia, trouble with sleeping, unusual increase in sweating, palpitations, unexplained fever, weakness and yawning.[F4718]      **Risk of Respiratory and Central Nervous System (CNS) Depression and Overdose**    Buprenorphine has been associated with life-threatening respiratory depression and death. Many, but not all, post-marketing reports regarding coma and death involved misuse by self-injection or were associated with the concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressant, including alcohol. Use buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets with caution in patients with compromised respiratory function (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cor pulmonale, decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression).[L46571]      **Risk of Overdose in Opioid Na茂ve Patients**    There have been reported deaths of opioid-na茂ve individuals who received a 2 mg dose of buprenorphine as a sublingual tablet for analgesia. Buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets are not appropriate as an analgesic in opioid-na茂ve patients.[L46571]      **Precipitation of Opioid Withdrawal Signs and Symptoms**    If buprenorphine is started in opioid-dependent individuals, it will displace the other opioids and cause a phenomenon known as ""precipitated withdrawal"" which is characterized by a rapid and intense onset of withdrawal symptoms. Individuals must therefore be in a state of mild to moderate withdrawal before starting therapy with buprenorphine.     Because it contains naloxone, buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets are also highly likely to produce marked and intense withdrawal signs and symptoms if misused parenterally by individuals dependent on full opioid agonists such as heroin, morphine, or methadone.[L46571]      **Gastrointestinal Effects**    Buprenorphine and other morphine-like opioids have been shown to decrease bowel motility and cause constipation. Buprenorphine may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions and should be administered with caution to patients with dysfunction of the biliary tract.[L46571]      **Effects on the Endocrine System**    Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date. Patients presenting with symptoms of androgen deficiency should undergo laboratory evaluation.[L46571]      **Adrenal Insufficiency**    Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.[L46571]      **Use in Patients With Impaired Hepatic Function**    Buprenorphine/naloxone products are not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment and may not be appropriate for patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The doses of buprenorphine and naloxone in this fixed-dose combination product cannot be individually titrated, and hepatic impairment results in a reduced clearance of naloxone to a much greater extent than buprenorphine. Therefore, patients with severe hepatic impairment will be exposed to substantially higher levels of naloxone than patients with normal hepatic function. This may result in an increased risk of precipitated withdrawal at the beginning of treatment (induction) and may interfere with buprenorphine鈥檚 efficacy throughout treatment. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, the differential reduction of naloxone clearance compared to buprenorphine clearance is not as great as in subjects with severe hepatic impairment. However, buprenorphine/naloxone products are not recommended for initiation of (treatment induction) in patients with moderate hepatic impairment due to the increased risk of precipitated withdrawal. Buprenorphine/naloxone products may be used with caution for maintenance treatment in patients with moderate hepatic impairment who have initiated treatment on a buprenorphine product without naloxone. However, patients should be carefully monitored and consideration given to the possibility of naloxone interfering with buprenorphine鈥檚 efficacy.[L46571]      **Risk of Hepatitis, Hepatic Events**    Cases of cytolytic hepatitis and hepatitis with jaundice have been observed in individuals receiving buprenorphine in clinical trials and through post-marketing adverse event reports. The spectrum of abnormalities ranges from transient asymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases to case reports of death, hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy. In many cases, the presence of pre-existing liver enzyme abnormalities, infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus, concomitant usage of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs, and ongoing injecting drug use may have played a causative or contributory role. In other cases, insufficient data were available to determine the etiology of the abnormality. Withdrawal of buprenorphine has resulted in amelioration of acute hepatitis in some cases; however, in other cases no dose reduction was necessary. The possibility exists that buprenorphine had a causative or contributory role in the development of the hepatic abnormality in some cases. Liver function tests, prior to initiation of treatment is recommended to establish a baseline. Periodic monitoring of liver function during treatment is also recommended. A biological and etiological evaluation is recommended when a hepatic event is suspected. Depending on the case, buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets may need to be carefully discontinued to prevent withdrawal signs and symptoms and a return by the patient to illicit drug use, and strict monitoring of the patient should be initiated.[L46571]      **Orthostatic Hypotension**    Like other opioids, buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients.      **Elevation of Cerebrospinal Fluid Pressure**    Buprenorphine, like other opioids, may elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure and should be used with caution in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions, and other circumstances when cerebrospinal pressure may be increased. Buprenorphine can produce miosis and changes in the level of consciousness that may interfere with patient evaluation.      **Elevation of Intracholedochal Pressure**    Buprenorphine has been shown to increase intracholedochal pressure, as do other opioids, and thus should be administered with caution to patients with dysfunction of the biliary tract.Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and an antagonist at the kappa-opioid receptor. It demonstrates a high affinity for the mu-opioid receptor but has lower intrinsic activity compared to other full mu-opioid agonists such as [heroin], [oxycodone], or [methadone].[A186292] This means that buprenorphine preferentially binds the opioid receptor and displaces lower affinity opioids without activating the receptor to a comparable degree. Clinically, this results in a slow onset of action and a clinical phenomenon known as the ""ceiling effect"" where once a certain dose is reached buprenorphine's effects plateau. This effect can be beneficial, however, as dose-related side effects such as respiratory depression, sedation, and intoxication also plateau at around 32mg, resulting in a lower risk of overdose compared to [methadone] and other full agonist opioids.[A186215,A186218] It also means that opioid-dependent patients do not experience sedation or euphoria at the same rate that they might experience with more potent opioids, improving quality of life for patients with severe pain and reducing the reinforcing effects of opioids which can lead to drug-seeking behaviours.[A186280]    Buprenorphine's high affinity, but low intrinsic activity for the mu-opioid receptor also means that if it is started in opioid-dependent individuals, it will displace the other opioids without creating an equal opioid effect and cause a phenomenon known as ""precipitated withdrawal"" which is characterized by a rapid and intense onset of withdrawal symptoms (i.e. anxiety, restlessness, gastrointestinal distress, diaphoresis, intense drug cravings, and tachycardia). Individuals must therefore be in a state of mild to moderate withdrawal before starting therapy with buprenorphine.     Buprenorphine is commercially available as the brand name product Suboxone which is formulated in a 4:1 fixed-dose combination product along with [naloxone], a non-selective competitive opioid receptor antagonist. Combination of an opioid agonist with an opioid antagonist may seem counterintuitive, however this combination with naloxone is intended to reduce the abuse potential of Suboxone, as naloxone is poorly absorbed by the oral route (and has no effect when taken orally), but would reverse the opioid agonist effects of buprenorphine if injected intravenously.[A186289,L46571]

592,"For short term treatment of acutely decompensated severe chronic heart failure (CHF). Also being investigated for use/treatment in heart disease.Levosimendan increases calcium sensitivity to myocytes by binding to troponin C in a calcium dependent manner. This increases contractility without raising calcium levels. It also relaxes vascular smooth muscle by opening adenosine triphosphate sensitive potassium channels. Levosimendan is used to manage acutely decompensated congestive heart failure.Levosimendan is a new Ca+-sensitizing inotropic agent. Ca2+ sensitizers represent a new class of inotropic agents, which overcome the disadvantages associated with currently available inotropic agents in as they are not associated with an increased risk of arrhythmias, cell injury and death due to Ca2+ overload in myocardial cells; they do not increase the activation energy; and they have the potential to reverse contractile dysfunction under pathophysiologic conditions, such as acidosis or myocardial stunning. Levosimendan has not been approved for use in the U.S. or Canada.Levosimendan appears to increase myofilament calcium sensitivity by binding to cardiac troponin C in a calcium-dependent manner. This stabilizes the calcium-induced conformational change of troponin C, thereby (1) changing actin-myosin cross-bridge kinetics apparently without increasing the cycling rate of the cross-bridges or myocardial ATP consumption, (2) increasing the effects of calcium on cardiac myofilaments during systole and (3) improving contraction at low energy cost (inotropic effect). Calcium concentration and, therefore, sensitization decline during diastole, allowing normal or improved diastolic relaxation. Levosimendan also leads to vasodilation through the opening of ATP-sensitive potassium channels. By these inotropic and vasodilatory actions, levosimendan increases cardiac output without increasing myocardial oxygen demand. Levosimendan also has a selective phosphodiesterase (PDE)-III inhibitory action that may contribute to the inotropic effect of this compound under certain experimental conditions. It has been reported that levosimendan may act preferentially as a Ca2+ sensitizer at lower concentrations, whereas at higher concentrations its action as a PDE-III inhibitor becomes more prominent in experimental animals and humans."
593,"For the treatment of infections caused by susceptible organisms.Ceforanide is administered parenterally. It has a longer elimination half-life than any currently available cephalosporin. Its activity is very similar to that of cefamandole, another second-generation cephalosporin antibiotic, except that ceforanide is less active against most gram-positive organisms. Many coliforms, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Proteus, are susceptible to ceforanide, as are most strains of Salmonella, Shigella, Hemophilus, Citrobacter and Arizona species.Ceforanide is a semisynthetic second-generation cephalosporin. The cephalosporins are bactericidal drugs with both gram-positive and gram-negative activity. They inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis in a way similar to the penicillins.The bactericidal activity of ceforanide results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs)."
594,"Cyclobenzaprine is indicated as a short-term (2-3 weeks) adjunct therapy, along with rest and physical therapy, for relief of muscle spasm associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions. It has not been found effective in the treatment of spasticity originating from cerebral or spinal cord disease, or spasticity in children with cerebral palsy.[L8408,L8411] Cyclobenzaprine is also occasionally used off-label for reducing pain and sleep disturbances in patients with fibromyalgia.[A184946]Cyclobenzaprine, a centrally-acting muscle relaxant, was first synthesized in 1961[A185039] and has been available for human use since 1977.[A184982] It was initially studied for use as antidepressant given its structural similarity to tricyclic antidepressants - it differs from [Amitriptyline] by only a single double bond.[A185039,A184982] Since its approval, it has remained relatively popular as an adjunctive, short-term treatment for acute skeletal muscle spasms secondary to musculoskeletal injury.Cyclobenzaprine is a skeletal muscle relaxant that works on areas of the brainstem to reduce skeletal muscle spasm, though its exact pharmacodynamic behaviour is currently unclear.[L8408,L8411,A184982] Despite its long half-life, it is relatively short-acting with a typical duration of action of 4-6 hours.[A184982] Cyclobenzaprine has been reported to contribute to the development of serotonin syndrome when used in combination with other serotonergic medications.[L8408,L8411,A36339] Symptoms of serotonin syndrome may include autonomic instability, changes to mental status, neuromuscular abnormalities, or gastrointestinal symptoms - treatment with cyclobenzaprine should be discontinued immediately if any of these reactions occur during therapy.[L8408,L8411]The exact mechanism of action of cyclobenzaprine has not been fully elucidated in humans, and much of the information available regarding its mechanism has been ascertained from early animal studies. There is some evidence that cyclobenzaprine exerts its effects at the supraspinal level, specifically within the locus coeruleus of the brainstem, with little-to-no action at neuromuscular junctions or directly on skeletal musculature[L8411,A184982]. Action on the brainstem is thought to result in diminished activity of efferent alpha and gamma motor neurons, likely mediated by inhibition of coeruleus-spinal or reticulospinal pathways, and ultimately depressed spinal cord interneuron activity.[A184982]    More recently it has been suggested that inhibition of descending serotonergic pathways in the spinal cord via action on 5-HT2 receptors may contribute to cyclobenzaprine’s observed effects.[A5896,A184982,A4862]"
595,"For the treatment of severe psoriasis in adults.Etretinate is a medication used to treat severe psoriasis. It is a synthetic aromatic retinoid. The mechanism of action of etretinate is still incompletely understood although, like retinoic acid, it is thought to interfere with the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes. It is thought to bind to the retinoic acid receptors. Etretinate is also believed to enhance the binding of cAMP to the regulatory RI subunit of cAMP dependent protein kinases. Etretinate was taken off the market in Canada in 1996 and America in 1998 due to the risk of birth defects. Etretinate is now used to treat T-cell lymphomas. It also appears to inhibit NADH oxidase activity.The active metabolite responsible for etretinate's effects, acitretin, is a retinoid. Retinoids have a structure similar to vitamin A and are involved in the normal growth of skin cells. Acitretin works by inhibiting the excessive cell growth and keratinisation (process by which skin cells become thickened due to the deposition of a protein within them) seen in psoriasis. It therefore reduces the thickening of the skin, plaque formation and scaling.The mechanism of action of the active metabolite, acitretin, is unknown, however it is believed to work by targeting specific receptors (retinoid receptors) in the skin which help normalize the growth cycle of skin cells."
596,"Famotidine is indicated in pediatric and adult patients (with the bodyweight of 40 kg and above) for the management of active duodenal ulcer (DU), active gastric ulcer, symptomatic non-erosive gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and erosive esophagitis due to GERD, diagnosed by biopsy.[L11139]    It is also indicated in adult patients for the treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions (e.g., Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, multiple endocrine neoplasias) and reduction of the risk of DU recurrence.[L11139]    The intravenous formulation of famotidine is available for some hospitalized patients with pathological hypersecretory conditions or intractable ulcers or as an alternative to the oral dosage form for short-term use in patients who are unable to take oral medication.[L11142]    Over-the-counter famotidine is used for the management and prevention of heartburn caused by gastroesophageal reflux in children and adults. Off-label uses of famotidine include the reduction of NSAIDs-associated gastrointestinal effects, treatment of refractory urticarial, prevention of stress ulcer in critically-ill patients, and symptomatic relief of gastritis.[L11166,L11172]Famotidine is a competitive histamine-2 (H2) receptor antagonist that works to inhibit gastric acid secretion. It is commonly used in gastrointestinal conditions related to acid secretion, such as gastric ulcers and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), in adults and children.[L11166] Compared to other H2 receptor antagonists, famotidine displays high selectivity towards this receptor; in a study consisting of healthy volunteers and patients with acid hypersecretory disease, famotidine was about 20 to 50 times more potent at inhibiting gastric acid secretion than [cimetidine] and eight times more potent than [ranitidine] on a weight basis.[A189462] Famotidine is used in various over-the-counter and off-label uses.[L11166] While oral formulations of famotidine are more commonly used, the intravenous solution of the drug is available for use in hospital settings.[L11142]Famotidine decreases the production of gastric acid, suppresses acid concentration and pepsin content, and decreases the volume of gastric secretion. Famotidine inhibits both basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, as well as acid secretion stimulated by food, caffeine, insulin, and pentagastrin.[L11139,L11142]    Famotidine has a dose-dependent therapeutic action, with the highest dose having the most extended duration of action and the highest inhibitory effect on gastric acid secretion. Following oral administration, the onset of action is within one hour, and the peak effect is reached within 1-3 hours. The duration of effect is about 10-12 hours.[A189459]Histamine acts as a local hormone that stimulates the acid output by parietal cells via a paracrine mechanism. Neuroendocrine cells called enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells lie close to the parietal cells and regulate the basal secretion of histamine. Histamine release is also promoted from stimulation by acetylcholine and gastrin, a peptide hormone. Gastrin (G) cells release gastrin, which works on CCK2 receptors on ECL cells. This action promotes the release of histamine from ECL cells. Upon release, histamine acts on H2 receptors expressed on the basolateral membrane of parietal cells, leading to increased intracellular cAMP levels and activated proton pumps on parietal cells. Proton pump releases more protons into the stomach, thereby increasing the secretion of acid. [T28] In conditions that are associated with acid hypersecretion such as ulcers, there is a loss of regulation of acid secretion. Famotidine works on H2 receptors and blocks the actions of histamine.[L11166]"
597,"Azacitidine (for subcutaneous or intravenous use) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with the following French-American-British (FAB) myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) subtypes: refractory anemia (RA) or refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) (if accompanied by neutropenia or thrombocytopenia or requiring transfusions), refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). Azacitidine is also indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients aged 1 month and older with newly diagnosed Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia (JMML).[L41910,L46861]    Azacitidine (for oral use) is indicated for continued treatment of adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who achieved first complete remission or complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery following intensive induction chemotherapy and are not able to complete intensive curative therapy.[L35335]Azacitidine is a pyrimidine nucleoside analogue with anti-neoplastic activity. It differs from cytosine by the presence of nitrogen in the C5-position, key in its hypomethylating activity.[A1406,A1413,A1415] Two main mechanisms of action have been proposed for azacitidine. One of them is the induction of cytotoxicity. As an analogue of cytidine, it is able to incorporate into RNA and DNA, disrupting RNA metabolism and inhibiting protein and DNA synthesis. The other one is through the inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, impairing DNA methylation.[A1407] Due to its anti-neoplastic activity and its ability to inhibit methylation in replicating DNA, azacytidine has been used mainly used in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), two types of cancer characterized by the presence of aberrant DNA methylation.[A1407,A1410,A1411,A1416,A1417]    In May 2004, the FDA approved the use of azacitidine administered subcutaneously for the treatment of MDS of all French-American-British (FAB) subtypes. In January 2007, the FDA approved the intravenous administration of azacitidine.[A1415] The use of oral azacitidine for the treatment of AML in patients in complete remission was approved by the FDA in September 2020.[L35335]The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis, and hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes critical for differentiation and proliferation.[L46861] Genome-wide DNA methylation levels in bone marrow granulocytes were reduced in patients with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia after the first treatment cycle of azacitidine (75 mg/m2 or 2.5 mg/kg), confirming the DNA-hypomethylating activity of azacitidine.[L46861]    The use of azacitidine causes anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in adult patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and pediatric patients with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Azacitidine may cause renal toxicity, tumor lysis syndrome and embryo-fetal toxicity. It may also lead to the development of hepatotoxicity in patients with severe pre-existing hepatic impairment.[L46861]Azacitidine (5-azacytidine) is a chemical analogue of the cytosine nucleoside present in DNA and RNA.[A1406,A1407] It induces antineoplastic activity by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase at low doses and inducing cytotoxicity by incorporating itself into RNA and DNA at high doses.[A1408,A1409,A1412]     Covalent binding to DNA methyltransferase results in DNA hypomethylation and prevents DNA synthesis.[A1412] On the other hand, the incorporation of azacitidine into RNA and DNA leads to cytotoxicity as follows: Following cellular uptake, azacitidine is phosphorylated by uridine-cytidine kinase to form 5-azacytidine monophosphate. Afterwards, pyrimidine monophosphate and diphosphate kinases phosphorylate 5-azacytidine monophosphate to form 5-azacytidine diphosphate and triphosphate, respectively. Azacitidine triphosphate is able to incorporate into RNA, disrupting RNA metabolism and protein synthesis. The reduction of azacytidine diphosphate leads to the formation of 5-aza-deoxycytidine diphosphate, which is then phosphorylated to form 5-azadeoxycitidine triphosphate, a compound able to incorporate into DNA and inhibit DNA synthesis.[A1407]    As a ribonucleoside, azacitidine incorporates into RNA to a larger extent than into DNA. Incorporating into RNA leads to the disassembly of polyribosomes, defective methylation and acceptor function of transfer RNA, and the inhibition of protein production, resulting in cell death. During the S-phase of the cell cycle, azacitidine exhibits the highest toxicity; however, the predominant mechanism of cytotoxicity has not been elucidated.[A1407]    The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine cause the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine. It is believed that azacitidine exerts its antineoplastic effects through direct cytotoxicity on abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow.[L46861]"

599,"For the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitisA broad-spectrum semisynthetic antibiotic related to tetracycline but excreted more slowly and maintaining effective blood levels for a more extended period.Methacycline is a tetracycline antibiotic. Similar to other tetracyclines, it has a wide spectrum of antimicrobial action. It is active against most Gram-positive bacteria (pneumococci, streptococci, staphylococci) and Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, salmonella, shigella, etc.), and towards agents causing onithosis, psittacosis, trachoma, and some Protozoa. Like other tetracyclines, the general usefulness of methacycline has been reduced with the onset of bacterial resistance.Methacycline, a tetracycline antibiotic, is a protein synthesis inhibitors, inhibiting the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex. Methacycline inhibits cell growth by inhibiting translation. It binds to the 16S part of the 30S ribosomal subunit and prevents the amino-acyl tRNA from binding to the A site of the ribosome. The binding is reversible in nature. Tetracyclines also have been found to inhibit matrix metalloproteinases. This mechanism does not add to their antibiotic effects, but has led to extensive research on chemically modified tetracyclines or CMTs (like incyclinide) for the treatmet of rosacea, acne, and various types of neoplasms."
600,"Used in the treatment of schizophrenia, organic brain disorders, alcoholism and psychoneuroses.A phenothiazine antipsychotic with effects similar to chlorpromazine.Mesoridazine, the besylate salt of a metabolite of thioridazine, is a phenothiazine tranquilizer. Pharmacological studies in laboratory animals have established that mesoridazine has a spectrum of pharmacodynamic actions typical of a major tranquilizer. In common with other tranquilizers it inhibits spontaneous motor activity in mice, prolongs thiopental and hexobarbital sleeping time in mice and produces spindles and block of arousal reaction in the EEG of rabbits. It is effective in blocking spinal reflexes in the cut and antagonizes d-amphetamine excitation and toxicity in grouped mice. It shows a moderate adrenergic blocking activity in vitro and in vivo and antagonizes 5-hydroxytryptamine in vivo. Intravenously administered, it lowers the blood pressure of anesthetized dogs. It has a weak antiacetylcholine effect in vitro.Based upon animal studies, mesoridazine, as with other phenothiazines, acts indirectly on reticular formation, whereby neuronal activity into reticular formation is reduced without affecting its intrinsic ability to activate the cerebral cortex. In addition, the phenothiazines exhibit at least part of their activities through depression of hypothalamic centers. Neurochemically, the phenothiazines are thought to exert their effects by a central adrenergic blocking action."
601,"For treatment of depression, including the depressed phase of bipolar depression, psychotic depression, and involutional melancholia, and may also be helpful in treating certain patients suffering severe depressive neurosis.Maprotiline is a tetracyclic antidepressant with similar pharmacological properties to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Similar to TCAs, maprotiline inhibits neuronal norepinephrine reuptake, possesses some anticholinergic activity, and does not affect monoamine oxidase activity. It differs from TCAs in that it does not appear to block serotonin reuptake. Maprotiline may be used to treat depressive affective disorders, including dysthymic disorder (depressive neurosis) and major depressive disorder. Maprotiline is effective at reducing symptoms of anxiety associated with depression.Maprotiline is a tetracyclic antidepressant. Although its main therapeutic use is in the treatment of depression, it has also been shown to exert a sedative effect on the anxiety component that often accompanies depression. In one sleep study, it was shown that maprotiline increases the duration of the REM sleep phase in depressed patients, compared to imipramine which reduced the REM sleep phase. Maprotiline is a strong inhibitor of noradrenaline reuptake in the brain and peripheral tissues, however it is worthy to note that it is a weak inhibitor of serotonergic uptake. In addition, it displays strong antihistaminic action (which may explain its sedative effects) as well as weak anticholinergic action. Maprotiline also has lower alpha adrenergic blocking activity than amitriptyline.Maprotiline exerts its antidepressant action by inhibition of presynaptic uptake of catecholamines, thereby increasing their concentration at the synaptic clefts of the brain. In single doses, the effect of maprotiline on the EEG revealed a rise in the alpha-wave density, a reduction of the alpha-wave frequency and an increase in the alpha-wave amplitude. However, as with other tricyclic antidepressants, maprotiline lowers the convulsive threshold. Maprotiline acts as an antagonist at central presynaptic &alpha;2-adrenergic inhibitory autoreceptors and hetero-receptors, an action that is postulated to result in an increase in central noradrenergic and serotonergic activity. Maprotiline is also a moderate peripheral &alpha;1 adrenergic antagonist, which may explain the occasional orthostatic hypotension reported in association with its use. Maprotiline also inhibits the amine transporter, delaying the reuptake of noradrenaline and norepinephrine. Lastly, maprotiline is a strong inhibitor of the histamine H1 receptor, which explains its sedative actions."
602,"Oxymetazoline is indicated for the topical treatment of persistent facial erythema associated with rosacea in adults.[L15062]    Ophthalmic oxymetazoline is indicated for the treatment of acquired blepharoptosis in adults.[L15057]    Oxymetazoline can be found in over-the-counter nasal products as a nasal decongestant.[L15092]    For off-label uses, oxymetazoline has been used during nasal intubation and during ear, nose, and throat surgery to improve visualization of the airway and to minimize post-operative bleeding.[A215542]Oxymetazoline is an imidazole derivative and a potent, direct-acting alpha (α)-adrenergic agonist with affinity to both α1- and α2-adrenoceptors.[A215542] Oxymetazoline is available in various formulations with a wide variety of clinical implications. The topical formulation of the drug is used to treat persistent facial redness in adults.[L15062] As an effective decongestant, oxymetazoline is available in over-the-counter intranasal sprays used to relieve nasal and sinus congestion caused by a wide variety of conditions, such as common cold, hay fever, and upper respiratory allergies.[A215587, L15092] In dentistry, oxymetazoline and tetracaine combination intranasal spray (Kovanaze) is used for regional anesthesia during dental procedures in children and adults.[L15057] In July 2020, the FDA approved the use of an ophthalmic formulation of oxymetazoline (Upneeq) in adults with acquired blepharoptosis, or ptosis, making it the first FDA-approved medical treatment for this medical condition.[L15042, L15067]Oxymetazoline is an adrenergic α1- and α2-agonist and a direct-acting sympathomimetic drug. By stimulating adrenergic receptors, oxymetazoline causes vasoconstriction of dilated arterioles and reduces blood flow.[L15057] In a radioligand competition study, oxymetazoline displayed higher affinity at α1A-adrenoceptors compared to α2B-adrenoceptors, but with higher potency at α2B-adrenoceptors.[A6969] When sprayed intranasally, oxymetazoline relieved relief nasal congestion and improved nasal airflow in patients with acute coryzal rhinitis for up to 12 hours following a single dose.[A226580]    An early _in vitro_ study demonstrated oxymetazoline to exert anti-oxidant actions, where it inhibited microsomal lipid peroxidation and mediated hydroxyl radical scavenging activity. This suggests that oxymetazoline has a beneficial effect against oxidants, which play a role in tissue damage in inflammation.[A228538]Oxymetazoline binds to α1- and α2-adrenoceptors, which are Gq- and Gi-protein-coupled receptors respectively. α1-adrenoceptors agonism promotes vascular smooth muscle contraction by increasing intracellular calcium levels through activating phospholipase C, while α2-adrenoceptors agonism, specifically the α2B-adrenoceptors, can also elicit vasoconstriction through the inhibition of adenyl cyclase.[L30438,A261986,A261991,A261996]    Rosacea is a condition characterized by transient and persistent facial erythema. By stimulating α1A-adrenoceptors and causing vasoconstriction, oxymetazoline is believed to diminish the symptoms of erythema.[A226570] In blepharoptosis, it is hypothesized that oxymetazoline works by stimulating α-adrenergic receptors on the Müller muscle that elevates the upper eyelid, causing muscle contraction.[A226575] Oxymetazoline is used in combination with tetracaine for local anesthesia in dentistry. Such combination use adds beneficial effects: the vasoconstrictor counteracts the local anesthetic agent's vasodilatory action, thereby constricting dilated arterioles and reducing blood flow to the application area.[A215572, L15057] Oxymetazoline relieves nasal congestion by vasoconstricting the respiratory microvasculature, in both resistance and capacitance blood vessels on the human nasal mucosa, leading to decreased nasal mucosal blood flow, edema, and airflow resistance.[A215592, L30438]"
603,"Key additive in many skin-care products for the treatment of acne, psoriasis, callouses, corns, keratosis pilaris and warts.A compound obtained from the bark of the white willow and wintergreen leaves, and also prepared synthetically. It has bacteriostatic, fungicidal, and keratolytic actions. Its salts, the salicylates, are used as analgesics.Salicylic acid treats acne by causing skin cells to slough off more readily, preventing pores from clogging up. This effect on skin cells also makes salicylic acid an active ingredient in several shampoos meant to treat dandruff. Use of straight salicylic solution may cause hyperpigmentation on unpretreated skin for those with darker skin types (Fitzpatrick phototypes IV, V, VI), as well as with the lack of use of a broad spectrum sunblock. Subsalicylate in combination with bismuth form the popular stomach relief aid known commonly as Pepto-Bismol. When combined the two key ingredients help control diarrhea, nausea, heartburn, and even gas. It is also very mildly anti-biotic.Salicylic acid directly irreversibly inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 to decrease conversion of arachidonic acid to precursors of prostaglandins and thromboxanes. Salicylate's use in rheumatic diseases is due to it's analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity. Salicylic acid is a key ingredient in many skin-care products for the treatment of acne, psoriasis, calluses, corns, keratosis pilaris, and warts. Salicylic acid allows cells of the epidermis to more readily slough off. Because of its effect on skin cells, salicylic acid is used in several shampoos used to treat dandruff. Salicylic acid is also used as an active ingredient in gels which remove verrucas (plantar warts). Salicylic acid competitively inhibits oxidation of uridine-5-diphosphoglucose (UDPG) with nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide (NAD) and noncompetitively with UDPG. It also competitively inhibits the transferring of the glucuronyl group of uridine-5-phosphoglucuronic acid (UDPGA) to a phenolic acceptor. Inhibition of mucopoly saccharide synthesis is likely responsible for the slowing of wound healing with salicylates."
604,"Used in the management of exogenous obesity as a short-term adjunct (a few weeks) in a regimen of weight reduction based on caloric restriction.A appetite depressant considered to produce less central nervous system disturbance than most drugs in this therapeutic category. It is also considered to be among the safest for patients with hypertension. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1994, p2290)Diethylpropion is a sympathomimetic stimulant drug marketed as an appetite suppressant. Chemically, it is the N,N-diethyl analog of cathinone. Its mechanism of action is similar to other appetite suppressants such as sibutramine, phentermine and dextroamphetamine.Diethylpropion is an amphetamine that stimulates neurons to release or maintain high levels of a particular group of neurotransmitters known as catecholamines; these include dopamine and norepinephrine. High levels of these catecholamines tend to suppress hunger signals and appetite. Diethylpropion (through catecholamine elevation) may also indirectly affect leptin levels in the brain. It is theorized that diethylpropion can raise levels of leptin which signal satiety. It is also theorized that increased levels of the catecholamines are partially responsible for halting another chemical messenger known as neuropeptide Y. This peptide initiates eating, decreases energy expenditure, and increases fat storage."

606,"For the relief of mild to moderate pain, for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea and for the treatment of idiopathic heavy menstrual blood loss. Also for relief of the signs and symptoms of acute and chronic rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent with antipyretic and antigranulation activities. It also inhibits prostaglandin biosynthesis.Meclofenamic acid is a nonsteroidal agent which has demonstrated anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activity in laboratory animals.The mode of action, like that of other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, is not known. Therapeutic action does not result from pituitary-adrenal stimulation. In animal studies, meclofenamic acid was found to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis and to compete for binding at the prostaglandin receptor site. In vitro meclofenamic acid was found to be an inhibitor of human leukocyte 5-lipoxygenase activity. These properties may be responsible for the anti-inflammatory action of meclofenamic acid. There is no evidence that meclofenamic acid alters the course of the underlying disease."
607,"Used as an adjunct with succinylcholine (or suxamethonium chloride) to prolong muscle relaxation and to prevent succinylcholine-induced muscle fasciculations.Hexafluronium bromide is a neuromuscular blocking agent used in anesthesiology to prolong and potentiate the skeletal muscle relaxing action of suxamethonium during surgery. It is known to bind and block the activity of plasma cholinesterases.Hexafluronium bromide is a cholinesterase antagonist that can be used to prolong the relaxation effects of succinylcholine or suxamethonium chloride. Suxamethonium acts as a depolarizing muscle relaxant. It imitates the action of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction and is degraded by pseudocholinesterase, a plasma cholinesterase. The prolonged stimulation of the acetylcholine receptor results first in disorganized muscle contractions, then in profound relaxation. Cholinesterases catalyze the hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into choline and acetic acid, a reaction necessary to allow a cholinergic neuron to return to its resting state after activation. There are two types of cholinesterase acetylcholinesterase and pseuodocholinesterase. The first hydrolyses acetylcholine more quickly; the latter hydrolyses butyrylcholine and succinylcholine more quickly. An absence or mutation of the pseudocholinesterase enzyme leads to a medical condition known simply as pseudocholinesterase deficiency. This is a silent condition that only manifests itself when people who have the deficiency receive the muscle relaxants succinylcholine or mivacurium during a surgery.Hexafluronium bromide is a non-competitive reversible inhibitor of human plasma cholinesterase or pseudocholinesterase.  Hexafluornium probably binds to anionic side receptors near the active center, causing a conformational change in the enzyme, preventing acylation of the esteratic site. The esteratic site on cholistereases is where acetylcholine is hydrolyzed to acetic acid and choline.   "
608,"For the treatment of Human immunovirus (HIV) infections in conjunction with other antivirals.A dideoxynucleoside compound in which the 3'-hydroxyl group on the sugar moiety has been replaced by a hydrogen. This modification prevents the formation of 5' to 3' phosphodiester linkages, which are needed for the elongation of DNA chains, thus resulting in the termination of viral DNA growth. The compound is a potent inhibitor of HIV replication at low concentrations, acting as a chain-terminator of viral DNA by binding to reverse transcriptase. Its principal toxic side effect is axonal degeneration resulting in peripheral neuropathy.Zalcitabine is an analog of 2'-deoxycytidine that is pharmacologically related to but structurally different from other nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Zalcitabine inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) both by competing with the natural substrate dGTP and by its incorporation into viral DNA.Zalcitabine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) with activity against Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1). Within cells, zalcitabine is converted to its active metabolite, dideoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate (ddCTP), by the sequential action of cellular enzymes. ddCTP interferes with viral RNA-directed DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase) by competing for utilization of the natural substrate deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate (dCTP), as well as incorpating into viral DNA. Due to it's lack of a 3'-OH group, the formation of a 5' to 3' phosphodiester linkage that is necessary for DNA chain elongation is inhibited, thus leading to the termination of viral DNA growth."
609,"For the topical treatment of chronic open-angle glaucoma.Demecarium is an indirect-acting parasympathomimetic agent that is used to treat glaucoma. It is a cholinesterase inhibitor or an anticholinesterase. Cholinesterase inhibitors prolong the effect of acetylcholine, which is released at the neuroeffector junction of parasympathetic postganglion nerves, by inactivating the cholinesterases that break it down. Demecarium inactivates both pseudocholinesterase and acetylcholinesterase. In the eye, this causes constriction of the iris sphincter muscle (causing miosis) and the ciliary muscle. The outflow of the aqueous humor is facilitated, which leads to a reduction in intraocular pressure.Demecarium is a long-acting cholinesterase inhibitor and potent miotic. Because of its toxicity, it should be reserved for use in patients with open-angle glaucoma or other chronic glaucomas not satisfactorily controlled with the short-acting miotics and other agents. Application of demecarium to the eye produces intense miosis and ciliary muscle contraction due to inhibition of cholinesterase, allowing acetylcholine to accumulate at sites of cholinergic transmission. These effects are accompanied by increased capillary permeability of the ciliary body and iris, increased permeability of the blood-aqueous barrier, and vasodilation. Myopia may be induced or, if present, may be augmented by the increased refractive power of the lens that results from the accommodative effect of the drug.Demecarium is an indirect-acting parasympathomimetic agent, also known as a cholinesterase inhibitor and anticholinesterase. Cholinesterase inhibitors prolong the effect of acetylcholine, which is released at the neuroeffector junction of parasympathetic postganglion nerves, by inactivating the cholinesterases that break it down. Demecarium inactivates both pseudocholinesterase and acetylcholinesterase. In the eye, this causes constriction of the iris sphincter muscle (causing miosis) and the ciliary muscle (affecting the accommodation reflex and causing a spasm of the focus to near vision). The outflow of the aqueous humor is facilitated, which leads to a reduction in intraocular pressure. Of the two actions, the effect on the accommodation reflex is the more transient and generally disappears before termination of the miosis."
610,"**Pain, fever, and inflammation**    Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), in the regular tablet form (immediate-release), is indicated to relieve pain, fever, and inflammation associated with many conditions, including the flu, the common cold, neck and back pain, dysmenorrhea, headache, tooth pain, sprains, fractures, myositis, neuralgia, synovitis, arthritis, bursitis, burns, and various injuries. It is also used for symptomatic pain relief after surgical and dental procedures [FDA label].     The _extra strength_ formulation of acetylsalicylic acid is also indicated for the management migraine pain with photophobia (sensitivity to light) and phonophobia (sensitivity to sound)[FDA label].    **Other indications**    ASA is also indicated for various other purposes, due to its ability to inhibit platelet aggregation. These include:     Reducing the risk of cardiovascular death in suspected cases of myocardial infarction (MI) [FDA label].     Reducing the risk of a first non-fatal myocardial infarction in patients, and for reducing the risk of morbidity and mortality in cases of unstable angina and in those who have had a prior myocardial infarction [FDA label].    For reducing the risk of transient ischemic attacks (TIA) and to prevent atherothrombotic cerebral infarction (in conjunction with other treatments) [FDA label].    For the prevention of thromboembolism after hip replacement surgery [FDA label].     For decreasing platelet to platelet adhesion following carotid endarterectomy, aiding in the prevention of transient ischemic attacks (TIA) [FDA label].    Used for patients undergoing hemodialysis with a silicone rubber arteriovenous cannula inserted to prevent thrombosis at the insertion site [FDA Label].     **Important note regarding use of the extended-release formulation [F4405]**    In the setting of acute myocardial infarction, or before percutaneous interventions, the extended-release form of acetylsalicylic acid should not be used. Use immediate-release formulations in scenarios requiring rapid onset of action [Label, F4405]. The extended-release form is taken to decrease the incidence of mortality and myocardial infarction (MI) for individuals diagnosed with chronic coronary artery disease (CAD), including patients with previous myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina or with chronic stable angina. Additionally, the extended-release form is used to decrease the risk of death and recurrent episodes of stroke in patients with a history of stroke or TIA [F4405].       Also known as _Aspirin_, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) is a commonly used drug for the treatment of pain and fever due to various causes. Acetylsalicylic acid has both anti-inflammatory and antipyretic effects.  This drug also inhibits platelet aggregation and is used in the prevention of blood clots stroke, and myocardial infarction (MI) [FDA label].      Interestingly, the results of various studies have demonstrated that long-term use of acetylsalicylic acid may decrease the risk of various cancers, including colorectal, esophageal, breast, lung, prostate, liver and skin cancer [A177325]. Aspirin is classified as a _non-selective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor_ [A32682, A177268] and is available in many doses and forms, including chewable tablets, suppositories, extended release formulations, and others [L5968].     Acetylsalicylic acid is a very common cause of accidental poisoning in young children. It should be kept out of reach from young children, toddlers, and infants [FDA label].**Effects on pain and fever**    Acetylsalicylic acid disrupts the production of prostaglandins throughout the body by targeting cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) [A177241, A10989, A32682]. Prostaglandins are potent, irritating substances that have been shown to cause headaches and pain upon injection into humans.  Prostaglandins increase the sensitivity of pain receptors and substances such as histamine and bradykinin. Through the disruption of the production and prevention of release of prostaglandins in inflammation, this drug may stop their action at pain receptors, preventing symptoms of pain. Acetylsalicylic acid is considered an antipyretic agent because of its ability to interfere with the production of brain prostaglandin E1. Prostaglandin E1 is known to be an extremely powerful fever-inducing agent [FDA label].     **Effects on platelet aggregation**    The inhibition of platelet aggregation by ASA occurs because of its interference with thromboxane A2 in platelets, caused by COX-1 inhibition. Thromboxane A2 is an important lipid responsible for platelet aggregation, which can lead to clot formation and future risk of heart attack or stroke  [FDA label].     **A note on cancer prevention**    ASA has been studied in recent years to determine its effect on the prevention of various malignancies [A177325]. In general, acetylsalicylic acid is involved in the interference of various cancer signaling pathways, sometimes inducing or upregulating tumor suppressor genes [A177325, A177403]. Results of various studies suggest that there are beneficial effects of long-term ASA use in the prevention of several types of cancer, including stomach, colorectal, pancreatic, and liver cancers [A177400].   Research is ongoing.Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) blocks prostaglandin synthesis. It is non-selective for COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes [A177241, A10989, A32682]. Inhibition of COX-1 results in the inhibition of platelet aggregation for about 7-10 days (average platelet lifespan). The acetyl group of acetylsalicylic acid binds with a serine residue of the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) enzyme, leading to irreversible inhibition. This prevents the production of pain-causing prostaglandins. This process also stops the conversion of arachidonic acid to thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which is a potent inducer of platelet aggregation [FDA label].  Platelet aggregation can result in clots and harmful venous and arterial thromboembolism, leading to conditions such as pulmonary embolism and stroke.     It is important to note that there is 60% homology between the protein structures of COX-1 and COX-2. ASA binds to serine 516 residue on the active site of COX-2 in the same fashion as its binding to the serine 530 residue located on the active site of COX-1. The active site of COX-2 is, however, slightly larger than the active site of COX-1, so that arachidonic acid (which later becomes prostaglandins) manages to bypass the aspirin molecule inactivating COX-2 [A32682, A177256].  ASA, therefore, exerts more action on the COX-1 receptor rather than on the COX-2 receptor [A177268]. A higher dose of acetylsalicylic acid is required for COX-2 inhibition [A177325]. "

Interestingly, the results of various studies have demonstrated that long-term use of acetylsalicylic acid may decrease the risk of various cancers, including colorectal, esophageal, breast, lung, prostate, liver and skin cancer [A177325]. Aspirin is classified as a _non-selective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor_ [A32682, A177268] and is available in many doses and forms, including chewable tablets, suppositories, extended release formulations, and others [L5968].     Acetylsalicylic acid is a very common cause of accidental poisoning in young children. It should be kept out of reach from young children, toddlers, and infants [FDA label].**Effects on pain and fever**    Acetylsalicylic acid disrupts the production of prostaglandins throughout the body by targeting cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) [A177241, A10989, A32682]. Prostaglandins are potent, irritating substances that have been shown to cause headaches and pain upon injection into humans.  Prostaglandins increase the sensitivity of pain receptors and substances such as histamine and bradykinin. Through the disruption of the production and prevention of release of prostaglandins in inflammation, this drug may stop their action at pain receptors, preventing symptoms of pain. Acetylsalicylic acid is considered an antipyretic agent because of its ability to interfere with the production of brain prostaglandin E1. Prostaglandin E1 is known to be an extremely powerful fever-inducing agent [FDA label].     **Effects on platelet aggregation**    The inhibition of platelet aggregation by ASA occurs because of its interference with thromboxane A2 in platelets, caused by COX-1 inhibition. Thromboxane A2 is an important lipid responsible for platelet aggregation, which can lead to clot formation and future risk of heart attack or stroke  [FDA label].     **A note on cancer prevention**    ASA has been studied in recent years to determine its effect on the prevention of various malignancies [A177325]. In general, acetylsalicylic acid is involved in the interference of various cancer signaling pathways, sometimes inducing or upregulating tumor suppressor genes [A177325, A177403]. Results of various studies suggest that there are beneficial effects of long-term ASA use in the prevention of several types of cancer, including stomach, colorectal, pancreatic, and liver cancers [A177400].   Research is ongoing.Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) blocks prostaglandin synthesis. It is non-selective for COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes [A177241, A10989, A32682]. Inhibition of COX-1 results in the inhibition of platelet aggregation for about 7-10 days (average platelet lifespan). The acetyl group of acetylsalicylic acid binds with a serine residue of the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) enzyme, leading to irreversible inhibition. This prevents the production of pain-causing prostaglandins. This process also stops the conversion of arachidonic acid to thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which is a potent inducer of platelet aggregation [FDA label].  Platelet aggregation can result in clots and harmful venous and arterial thromboembolism, leading to conditions such as pulmonary embolism and stroke.     It is important to note that there is 60% homology between the protein structures of COX-1 and COX-2. ASA binds to serine 516 residue on the active site of COX-2 in the same fashion as its binding to the serine 530 residue located on the active site of COX-1. The active site of COX-2 is, however, slightly larger than the active site of COX-1, so that arachidonic acid (which later becomes prostaglandins) manages to bypass the aspirin molecule inactivating COX-2 [A32682, A177256].  ASA, therefore, exerts more action on the COX-1 receptor rather than on the COX-2 receptor [A177268]. A higher dose of acetylsalicylic acid is required for COX-2 inhibition [A177325]. "
612,"Fulvestrant is a drug treatment of hormone receptor (HR)-positive metastatic breast cancer in post-menopausal women with disease progression following anti-estrogen therapy. It is an estrogen receptor antagonist with no agonist effects, which works both by down-regulating and by degrading the estrogen receptor.Fulvestrant competitively and reversibly binds to estrogen receptors present in cancer cells and achieves its anti-estrogen effects through two separate mechanisms. First, fulvestrant binds to the receptors and downregulates them so that estrogen is no longer able to bind to these receptors. Second, fulvestrant degrades the estrogen receptors to which it is bound. Both of these mechanisms inhibit the growth of tamoxifen-resistant as well as estrogen-sensitive human breast cancer cell lines."
613,"Used to treat serious gram&ndash;negative infections of the lungs, urinary tract, and skin.Semisynthetic ampicillin-derived acylureido penicillin. It has been proposed for infections with certain anaerobes and may be useful in inner ear, bile, and CNS infections.Mezlocillin is a penicillin beta-lactam antibiotic used in the treatment of bacterial infections caused by susceptible, usually gram-positive, organisms. The name ""penicillin"" can either refer to several variants of penicillin available, or to the group of antibiotics derived from the penicillins. Mezlocillin has <i>in vitro</i> activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The bactericidal activity of mezlocillin results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis and is mediated through mezlocillin binding to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). Mezlocillin is stable against hydrolysis by a variety of beta-lactamases, including penicillinases, and cephalosporinases and extended spectrum beta-lactamases. Mezlocillin can be used to treat susceptible strains of H. influenzae, Klebsiella species, Pseudomonas species, Proteus mirabilis, E. coli, Enterobacter species, Streptococcus faecelis, Peptococcus species, Peptostreptococcus species, Bacteriodes</i> species (including B. fragilis), Morganella morganii, Serratia species, N. gonorrhoeae, P. vulgaris, and Providencia rettgeri. This drug is discontinued in the U.S.By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, mezlocillin inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that mezlocillin interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."
614,"For use only in those patients who respond inadequately to alternative treatments and whose epilepsy is so severe that a substantial risk of aplastic anemia and/or liver failure is deemed acceptable in light of the benefits conferred by its use.Felbamate is an anticonvulsant drug used in the treatment of epilepsy. In particular, in the adult patient population, it can be employed to treat partial seizures (with and without generalization). Alternatively, it is used to treat partial and generalized seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in children. It has a weak inhibitory effect on GABA receptor binding sites.Felbamate is an antiepileptic indicated as monotherapy or as an adjunct to other anticonvulsants for the treatment of partial seizures resulting from epilepsy. Receptor-binding studies <i>in vitro</i> indicate that felbamate has weak inhibitory effects on GABA-receptor binding, benzodiazepine receptor binding, and is devoid of activity at the MK-801 receptor binding site of the NMDA receptor-ionophore complex. However, felbamate does interact as an antagonist at the strychnine-insensitive glycine recognition site of the NMDA receptor-ionophore complex.The mechanism by which felbamate exerts its anticonvulsant activity is unknown, but in animal test systems designed to detect anticonvulsant activity, felbamate has properties in common with other marketed anticonvulsants. <i>In vitro</i> receptor binding studies suggest that felbamate may be an antagonist at the strychnine-insensitive glycine-recognition site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-ionophore complex. Antagonism of the NMDA receptor glycine binding site may block the effects of the excitatory amino acids and suppress seizure activity. Animal studies indicate that felbamate may increase the seizure threshold and may decrease seizure spread. It is also indicated that felbamate has weak inhibitory effects on GABA-receptor binding, benzodiazepine receptor binding."
615,"In the United States, fexofenadine is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of allergic rhinitis in patients ≥2 years old and chronic idiopathic urticaria in patients ≥6 months old.[L4269] In Canada, fexofenadine carries the same indications but is approved only for patients ≥12 years old.[L10779] Fexofenadine is also available in combination with [pseudoephedrine] for the symptomatic treatment of season allergic rhinitis in patients ≥12 years old.[L10800]Fexofenadine is an over-the-counter second-generation antihistamine used in the treatment of various allergic symptoms.[L4269] It is selective for the H1 receptor, carries little-to-no activity at off-targets, and does not cross the blood-brain barrier[L10779] - this is in contrast to previous first-generation antihistamines, such as [diphenhydramine], which readily bind to off-targets that contribute to side effects such as sedation.[A1452] Fexofenadine is the major active metabolite of [terfenadine][A1495] and is administered as a racemic mixture in which both enantiomers display approximately equivalent antihistamine activity.[L10779]Fexofenadine relieves allergy symptoms by antagonizing the actions of histamine, an endogenous compound predominantly responsible for allergic symptomatology.[L4269] The relatively long duration of action of fexofenadine (approximately 24 hours)[A1495] allows for once or twice daily dosing, and its rapid absorption allows for an onset of action within 1-3 hours. Fexofenadine should not be taken with fruit juice, as this may impair its absorption.[L4269]The H1 histamine receptor is responsible for mediating hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. Exposure to an allergen results in degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes.[A1495]    Fexofenadine is considered an “inverse agonist” of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects.[A1495] It has a potent and selective affinity for H1 receptors, and there is no evidence that it carries antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, sedative, or adrenergic blocking activity.[L10779] Fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and thus is unlikely to cause significant CNS effects.[L10779]"
616,"Isoniazid is used for the treatment of all forms of tuberculosis in which organisms are susceptible.[L45369]Antibacterial agent used primarily as a tuberculostatic. It remains the treatment of choice for tuberculosis.Isoniazid is a bactericidal agent active against organisms of the genus Mycobacterium, specifically M. tuberculosis, M. bovis and M. kansasii. It is a highly specific agent, ineffective against other microorganisms. Isoniazid is bactericidal when mycobacteria grow rapidly and bacteriostatic when they grow slowly.Isoniazid is a prodrug and must be activated by bacterial catalase. Specficially, activation is associated with reduction of the mycobacterial ferric KatG catalase-peroxidase by hydrazine and reaction with oxygen to form an oxyferrous enzyme complex. Once activated, isoniazid inhibits the synthesis of mycoloic acids, an essential component of the bacterial cell wall. At therapeutic levels isoniazid is bacteriocidal against actively growing intracellular and extracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis organisms. Specifically isoniazid inhibits InhA, the enoyl reductase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, by forming a covalent adduct with the NAD cofactor. It is the INH-NAD adduct that acts as a slow, tight-binding competitive inhibitor of InhA."
617,"For the acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without aura in adults.Naratriptan is a triptan drug that is selective for the 5-hydroxytryptamine1 receptor subtype. It is typically used for the treatment of migraine headaches.Naratriptan is a selective agonist of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) type 1B and 1D receptors. It is structurally and pharmacologically related to other selective 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist. Naratriptan has only a weak affinity for 5-HT1A, 5-HT5A, and 5-HT7 receptors and no significant affinity or pharmacological activity at 5-HT2, 5-HT3 or 5-HT4 receptor subtypes or at alpha1-, alpha2-, or beta-adrenergic, dopamine1,; dopamine2; muscarinic, or benzodiazepine receptors. This action in humans correlates with the relief of migraine headache. In addition to causing vasoconstriction, experimental data from animal studies show that Naratriptan also activates 5-HT1 receptors on peripheral terminals of the trigeminal nerve innervating cranial blood vessels, which may also contribute to the antimigrainous effect of Naratriptan in humans.Three distinct pharmacological actions have been implicated in the antimigraine effect of the triptans: (1) stimulation of presynaptic 5-HT1D receptors, which serves to inhibit both dural vasodilation and inflammation; (2) direct inhibition of trigeminal nuclei cell excitability via 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonism in the brainstem and (3) vasoconstriction of meningeal, dural, cerebral or pial vessels as a result of vascular 5-HT1B receptor agonism."
618,"Rizatriptan is indicated for the acute treatment of diagnosed migraine with or without aura.[L46018, L46023, L46038, L46043] Rizatriptan is not indicated for the prophylactic therapy of migraine nor the treatment of cluster headache.[L46018]    In Canada, rizatriptan is approved in adults.[L46038, L46043] In the US, the oral tablet formulations are used in patients six years of age and older [L46018] and the oral film formation is approved for patients 12 years of age and older weighing 40 kg or more.[L46023] Rizatriptan is a second-generation triptan [A258918] and a selective 5-HT1B and 5-HT1Dreceptor agonist.[L46018] Used in the treatment of migraines, rizatriptan was first approved in the US in 1998.[L46018] Rizatriptan is available in oral tablets, orally disintegrating tablets (wafers), and oral film formulations.Rizatriptan relieves migraine-associated symptoms.[A1460, A258928, L46018] Rizatriptan is reported to reach the maximum plasma concentrations more quickly and produces a more rapid onset of pain relief than other triptans, such as [sumatriptan];[A1464, A258918, A258928] however, it has a relatively shorter elimination half-life than other triptans.[A258928] Rizatriptan causes transient increases in blood pressure to some extent.[A1460] _In vitro_, rizatriptan was shown to contract isolated human coronary arteries; however, since the EC50 for this effect is high, rizatriptan is not expected to cause myocardial ischemia at therapeutic plasma concentrations in patients with normal coronary circulation.[A258918]    Rizatriptan has a weak affinity for other 5-HT1 receptor subtypes (5-HT1A, 5-HT1E, 5-HT1F) and the 5-HT7 receptor but has no significant activity at 5-HT2, 5-HT3, alpha- and beta-adrenergic, dopaminergic, histaminergic, muscarinic or benzodiazepine receptors.[L46038]There are several physiological and molecular processes implicated in the pathophysiology of migraine. Vasodilation of intracranial extracerebral blood vessels, particularly those supplying the dura mater, has been associated with migraine pain.[A1460, A258928] Activation of the trigeminovascular system leads to the release of vasoactive neuropeptides (such as substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and neurokinin A) from the trigeminal nerve innervating the intracranial vessels and dura mater. Vasoactive neuropeptides cause perivascular inflammation and vasodilation in the periphery. Migraine-associated nausea and vomiting are thought to arise from the activation of central and nociceptive sensory neurons that project to autonomic brain-stem nuclei and higher subcortical and cortical pain processing centres.[A1460] An imbalance in serotonin (5-HT) levels has also been documented: 5-HT binds to 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors to promote trigeminal neuronal firing and vasoconstriction.[A1460, A258968]    Rizatriptan is a selective agonist at the 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system. It binds to these receptors with high affinity.[L46018] The exact mechanism of action of rizatriptan has not been fully elucidated; however, several documented pharmacological actions of rizatriptan may contribute to its antimigraine effects. Rizatriptan causes vasoconstriction of intracranial extracerebral blood vessels, which is thought to occur primarily via 5-HT1B receptors. Rizatriptan also inhibits nociceptive neurotransmission in trigeminal pain pathways. It attenuates the release of vasoactive neuropeptides by the trigeminal nerve, which is thought to occur via neurogenic and central 5-HT1D receptors.[A1460, A258918, A258928] Rizatriptan inhibited neurogenic dural vasodilation and plasma protein extravasation in animal studies.[A1460, A5971, A258918, A258928]"
619,"For the treatment of the following mild-to-moderate infections caused by susceptible strains of microorganisms: acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, secondary bacterial infection of acute bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia, pharyngitis/tonsilitis, and uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections.Dirithromycin is a macrolide glycopeptide antibiotic used to treat many different types of bacterial infections, such as bronchitis, pneumonia, tonsillitis, and even skin infections.Dirithromycin is a pro-drug which is converted non-enzymatically during intestinal absorption into the microbiologically active moiety erythromycylamine. Erythromycylamine exerts its activity by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunits of susceptible mircoorganisms resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis. Dirithromycin/erythromycylamine has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms both in vitro and in clinical infections: Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains only), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.Dirithromycin prevents bacteria from growing, by interfering with their protein synthesis. Dirithromycin binds to the 50S subunit of the 70S bacterial ribosome, and thus inhibits the translocation of peptides. Dirithromycin has over 10 times higher affinity to the subunit 50S than erythromycin. In addition, dirithromycin binds simultaneously in to two domains of 23S RNA of the ribosomal subunit 50S, where older macrolides bind only in one. Dirithromycin can also inhibit the formation of ribosomal subunits 50S and 30S."
620,"For the treatment of bacteremia, septicaemia, respiratory tract infections, skin and soft-tissue infection, burns, wounds, and peri-operative infections caused by susceptible strains.Netilmicin is a semisynthetic 1-N-ethyl derivative of sisomycin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic with action similar to gentamicin, but less ear and kidney toxicity. Netilmicin inhibits protein synthesis in susceptible organisms by binding to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit and interfering with mRNA binding and the acceptor tRNA site. The bactericidal effect of netilmiicin is not fully understood.Netilmicin is a semisynthetic, water soluble antibiotic of the aminoglycoside group, produced by the fermentation of Micromonospora inyoensis, a species of actinomycete. Aminoglycosides are useful primarily in infections involving aerobic, Gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and Enterobacter. It is active at low concentrations against a wide variety of pathogenic bacteria including Escherichia coli, bacteria of the Klebsiella-Enterobacter-Serratia group, Citrobacter sp., Proteus sp. (indole-positive and indole-negative), including Proteus mirabilis, P. morganii, P. rettgrei, P. vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Neisseria gonorrhoea. Netilmicin is also active in vitro against isolates of Hemophilus influenzae, Salmonella sp. Shigella sp. and against penicillinase and non-penicillinase-producing Staphylococcus including methicillin-resistant strains. Some strains of Providencia sp.Acinetobacter sp. and Aeromonas sp. are also sensitive to netilmicin. Many strains of the above organisms which are found to be resistant to other aminoglycosides, such as kanamycin, gentamicin, tobramycin and sisomicin, are susceptible to netilmicin in vitro. Occasionally, strains have been identified which are resistant to amikacin but susceptible to netilmicin. The combination of netilmicin and penicillin G has a synergistic bactericidal effect against most strains of Streptococcus faecalis (enterococcus). The combined effect of netilmicin and carbenicillin or ticarcillin is synergistic for many strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In addition, many isolates of Serratia, which are resistant to multiple antibiotics, are inhibited by synergistic combinations of netilmicin with carbenicillin, azlocillin, mezlocillin, cefamandole, cefotaxime or moxalactam. Aminoglycosides are mostly ineffective against anaerobic bacteria, fungi and viruses.Aminoglycosides like netilmicin ""irreversibly"" bind to specific 30S-subunit proteins and 16S rRNA. Specifically netilmicin binds to four nucleotides of 16S rRNA and a single amino acid of protein S12. This interferes with decoding site in the vicinity of nucleotide 1400 in 16S rRNA of 30S subunit. This region interacts with the wobble base in the anticodon of tRNA. This leads to interference with the initiation complex, misreading of mRNA so incorrect amino acids are inserted into the polypeptide leading to nonfunctional or toxic peptides and the breakup of polysomes into nonfunctional monosomes, leaving the bacterium unable to synthesize proteins vital to its growth."
621,"Hydrocodone is indicated for the management of acute pain.[label,L7991]Hydrocodone is a synthetic opioid derivative of codeine.[T116] It is commonly used in combination with [acetaminophen] to control moderate to severe pain. Historically, hydrocodone has been used as a cough suppressant although this has largely been replaced by [dextromethorphan] in current cough and cold formulations. Hydrocodone's more potent metabolite, [hydromorphone] has also found wide use as an analgesic and is frequently used in cases of severe pain. The FDA first approved Hydrocodone for use as part of the cough suppressant syrup Hycodan in March of 1943.[L9025]Hydrocodone inhibits pain signaling in both the spinal cord and brain [A176495]. Its actions in the brain also produce euphoria, respiratory depression, and sedation.Hydrocodone binds to the mu opioid receptor (MOR) with the highest affinity followed by the delta opioid receptors (DOR).[A182165] Hydrocodone's agonist effect at the MOR is considered to contribute the most to its analgesic effects. Both MOR and DOR are Gi/o coupled and and produces its signal through activation of inward rectifier potassium (GIRK) channels, inhibition of voltage gated calcium channel opening, and decreased adenylyl cyclase activity.[T116] In the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, activation of pre-synaptic MOR on primary afferents the inhibition of calcium channel opening and increased activity of GIRK channels hyperpolarizes the neuron and prevents release of neurotransmitters. Post-synaptic MOR can also prevent activation of neurons by glutamate through the aforementioned mechanisms.     Hydrocodone can also produce several actions in the brain similarly to other opioids.   Activation of MOR in the periaquaductal gray (PAG) inhibits the GABAergic tone on medulo-spinal neurons.[T116,A176495] This allows these neurons, which project to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, to suppress pain signalling in secondary afferents by activating inhibitory interneurons. MOR can also inhibit GABAergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area, removing the inhibitory tone on dopaminergic neurons in the nucleus accumbens and contributing to the activation of the brain's reward and addiction pathway. The inhibitory action or MOR likely contributes to respiratory depression, sedation, and suppression of the cough reflex.     Activation of DOR may contribute to analgesia through the above mechanisms but has not been well studied.[A176495]"

626,"For production of local or regional analgesia and anesthesia by local infiltration, peripheral nerve block techniques, and central neural techniques including epidural and caudal blocks.A local anesthetic that is chemically related to bupivacaine but pharmacologically related to lidocaine. It is indicated for infiltration, nerve block, and epidural anesthesia. Mepivacaine is effective topically only in large doses and therefore should not be used by this route. (From AMA Drug Evaluations, 1994, p168)Mepivicaine is an amide local anesthetic. Mepivicaine as a reasonably rapid onset and medium duration and is known by the proprietary names as Carbocaine and Polocaine. Mepivicaine is used in local infiltration and regional anesthesia. Systemic absorption of local anesthetics produces effects on the cardiovascular and central nervous systems. At blood concentrations achieved with normal therapeutic doses, changes in cardiac conduction, excitability, refractoriness, contractility, and peripheral vascular resistance are minimal.Local anesthetics block the generation and the conduction of nerve impulses, presumably by increasing the threshold for electrical excitation in the nerve, by slowing the propagation of the nerve impulse, and by reducing the rate of rise of the action potential. In general, the progression of anesthesia is related to the diameter, myelination, and conduction velocity of affected nerve fibers. Clinically, the order of loss of nerve function is as follows: pain, temperature, touch, proprioception, and skeletal muscle tone."
627,"For the treatment of short-term treatment of insomnia in adults.Zaleplon is a sedative/hypnotic, mainly used for insomnia. It is known as a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic. Zaleplon interacts with the GABA receptor complex and shares some of the pharmacological properties of the benzodiazepines. Zaleplon is a schedule IV drug in the United States.Zaleplon is a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic from the pyrazolopyrimidine class and is indicated for the short-term treatment of insomnia. While Zaleplon is a hypnotic agent with a chemical structure unrelated to benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or other drugs with known hypnotic properties, it interacts with the gamma-aminobutyric acid-benzodiazepine (GABABZ) receptor complex. Subunit modulation of the GABABZ receptor chloride channel macromolecular complex is hypothesized to be responsible for some of the pharmacological properties of benzodiazepines, which include sedative, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, and anticonvulsive effects in animal models. Zaleplon also binds selectively to the CNS GABAA-receptor chloride ionophore complex at benzodiazepine(BZ) omega-1 (BZ1, ο1) receptors. Zaleplon exerts its action through subunit modulation of the GABABZ receptor chloride channel macromolecular complex. Zaleplon also binds selectively to the brain omega-1 receptor located on the alpha subunit of the GABA-A/chloride ion channel receptor complex and potentiates t-butyl-bicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) binding."
628,"For the treatment of postoperative inflammation in patients who have undergone cataract extraction.Bromfenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for ophthalmic use. Ophthalmic NSAIDs are becoming a cornerstone for the management of ocular pain and inflammation. Their well-characterized anti-inflammatory activity, analgesic property, and established safety record have also made NSAIDs an important tool for optimizing surgical outcomes. Non-ophthalmic formulations of bromfenac were withdrawn in the US in 1998 due to cases of severe liver toxicity.[L43942,T239]Bromfenac ophthalmic solution is a sterile, topical, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for ophthalmic use.The mechanism of its action is thought to be due to its ability to block prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting cyclooxygenase 1 and 2. Prostaglandins have been shown in many animal models to be mediators of certain kinds of intraocular inflammation. In studies performed in animal eyes, prostaglandins have been shown to produce disruption of the blood-aqueous humor barrier, vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, leukocytosis, and increased intraocular pressure."
629,"[L44652] Also used in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as the treatment of congestive heart failure (only in patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors).[A255892]Telmisartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARB) used in the management of hypertension. Generally, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) such as telmisartan bind to the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptors with high affinity, causing inhibition of the action of angiotensin II on vascular smooth muscle, ultimately leading to a reduction in arterial blood pressure.[A1489,A1490] Recent studies suggest that telmisartan may also have PPAR-gamma agonistic properties that could potentially confer beneficial metabolic effects.[A1492]Telmisartan is an orally active nonpeptide angiotensin II antagonist that acts on the AT1 receptor subtype. It has the highest affinity for the AT1 receptor among commercially available ARBs and has minimal affinity for the AT2 receptor.[L44652] New studies suggest that telmisartan may also have PPAR&gamma; agonistic properties that could potentially confer beneficial metabolic effects, as PPAR&gamma; is a nuclear receptor that regulates specific gene transcription, and whose target genes are involved in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as anti-inflammatory responses. This observation is currently being explored in clinical trials.[A1492] Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Telmisartan works by blocking the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone secretory effects of angiotensin II.[A1490,L44652]Telmisartan interferes with the binding of angiotensin II to the angiotensin II AT1-receptor by binding reversibly and selectively to the receptors in vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. As angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor, which also stimulates the synthesis and release of aldosterone, blockage of its effects results in decreases in systemic vascular resistance. Telmisartan does not inhibit the angiotensin converting enzyme, other hormone receptors, or ion channels.[L44652] Studies also suggest that telmisartan is a partial agonist of PPAR&gamma;, which is an established target for antidiabetic drugs. This suggests that telmisartan can improve carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, as well as control insulin resistance without causing the side effects that are associated with full PPAR&gamma; activators.[A1492]"
630,"For the relief of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis, perennial (non-seasonal) allergic rhinitis. Desloratidine is also used for the sympomatic treatment of pruritus and urticaria (hives) associated with chronic idiopathic urticaria.Desloratadine is a second generation, tricyclic antihistamine that which has a selective and peripheral H1-antagonist action. It is the active descarboethoxy metabolite of loratidine (a second generation histamine). Desloratidine has a long-lasting effect and does not cause drowsiness because it does not readily enter the central nervous system.Desloratadine is a long-acting second-generation H1-receptor antagonist which has a selective and peripheral H1-antagonist action. Histamine is a chemical that causes many of the signs that are part of allergic reactions, such as the swelling of tissues. Histamine is released from histamine-storing cells (mast cells) and attaches to other cells that have receptors for histamine. The attachment of the histamine to the receptors causes the cell to be ""activated,"" releasing other chemicals which produce the effects that we associate with allergies. Desloratadine blocks one type of receptor for histamine (the H1 receptor) and thus prevents activation of cells by histamine. Unlike most other antihistamines, Desloratadine does not enter the brain from the blood and, therefore, does not cause drowsiness.Like other H1-blockers, Desloratadine competes with free histamine for binding at H1-receptors in the GI tract, uterus, large blood vessels, and bronchial smooth muscle. This blocks the action of endogenous histamine, which subsequently leads to temporary relief of the negative symptoms (eg. nasal congestion, watery eyes) brought on by histamine."
631,"[L32619] Methyldopa injection is used to manage hypertensive crises.[L32624]Methyldopa, or α-methyldopa, is a centrally acting sympatholytic agent and an antihypertensive agent.[A231784] It is an analog of DOPA (3,4‐hydroxyphenylanine), and it is a prodrug, meaning that the drug requires biotransformation to an active metabolite for therapeutic effects. Methyldopa works by binding to alpha(α)-2 adrenergic receptors as an agonist, leading to the inhibition of adrenergic neuronal outflow and reduction of vasoconstrictor adrenergic signals.[A1499] Methyldopa exists in two isomers D-α-methyldopa and L-α-methyldopa, which is the active form.[A232224]    First introduced in 1960 as an antihypertensive agent, methyldopa was considered to be useful in certain patient populations, such as pregnant women and patients with renal insufficiency. Since then, methyldopa was largely replaced by newer, better-tolerated antihypertensive agents;[L32619] Methyldopa is also available as intravenous injection, which is used to manage hypertension when oral therapy is unfeasible and to treat hypertensive crisis.[L32624]Antihypertensive effects of methyldopa are mostly mediated by its pharmacologically active metabolite, alpha-methylnorepinephrine, which works as an agonist at central inhibitory alpha-adrenergic receptors.[L32614] Stimulation of alpha-adrenergic receptors leads to decreased peripheral sympathetic tone and reduced arterial pressure.[A1505] Methyldopa causes a net reduction in the tissue concentration of serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. Overall, methyldopa lowers both standing blood pressure and especially supine blood pressure, with infrequent symptomatic postural hypotension. Methyldopa also reduces plasma renin activity but has negligible effects on glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow, or filtration fraction. It also has no direct effect on cardiac function but in some patients, a slowed heart rate may occur.[L32614]    Following oral administration, blood-pressure-lowering effects are observed within 12 to 24 hours in most patients, and a maximum reduction in blood pressure occurs in 4 to 6 hours. Blood pressure returns to pre-treatment levels within 24 to 48 hours following drug discontinuation.[L32614] Following intravenous administration, the blood-pressure-lowering effects of methyldopa last for about 10 to 16 hours.[A231784]The exact mechanism of methyldopa is not fully elucidated; however, the main mechanisms of methyldopa involve its actions on alpha-adrenergic receptor and the aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase enzyme, to a lesser extent. The sympathetic outflow is regulated by alpha (α)-2 adrenergic receptors and imidazoline receptors expressed on adrenergic neurons within the rostral ventrolateral medulla.[A1501] Methyldopa is metabolized to α‐methylnorepinephrine via dopamine beta-hydroxylase activity and, consequently, alpha-methylepinephrine via phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase activity.[A232244, A232249, A232259] Mediating the therapeutic effects of methyldopa, α‐methylnorepinephrine and α-methylepinephrine active metabolites are agonists at presynaptic alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in the brainstem. Stimulating alpha-2 adrenergic receptors results in the inhibition of adrenergic neuronal outflow and attenuation of norepinephrine release in the brainstem. Consequently, the output of vasoconstrictor adrenergic signals to the peripheral sympathetic nervous system is reduced, leading to a reduction in blood pressure.[A1499]    The L-isomer of alpha-methyldopa also reduces blood pressure by inhibiting aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase, also known as DOPA decarboxylase, which is an enzyme responsible for the syntheses of dopamine and serotonin.[L32614] Inhibiting this enzyme leads to depletion of biogenic amines such as norepinephrine. However, inhibition of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase plays a minimal role in the blood-pressure‐lowering effect of methyldopa.[A1501, A1505]"
632,"Only for the treatment of symptoms of severe diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in women with chronic symptoms (generally lasting greater than 6 months) who does not present with anatomic or biochemical GI abnormalities and have not responded to conventional therapy.Alosetron is a 5-HT3 antagonist used only for the management of severe diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in women. Alosetron has an antagonist action on the 5-HT3 receptors and thus may modulate serotonin-sensitive gastrointestinal (GI) processes. Alosetron was voluntarily withdrawn from the US market in November 2000 by the manufacturer due to numerous reports of severe adverse effects including ischemic colitis, severely obstructed or ruptured bowel, and death. In June 2002, the FDA approved a supplemental new drug application allowing the remarketing of the drug under restricted conditions of use.Alosetron is a potent and selective antagonist of the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor type. Activation of these receptors and the resulting neuronal depolarization affects the regulation of visceral pain, colonic transit, and GI secretions processes that are related to IBS. By blocking these receptors, alosetron is able to effectively control IBS.Alosetron is a potent and selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. 5-HT3 receptors are nonselective cation channels that are extensively distributed on enteric neurons in the human gastrointestinal tract, as well as other peripheral and central locations. Activation of these channels and the resulting neuronal depolarization affect the regulation of visceral pain, colonic transit and gastrointestinal secretions, processes that relate to the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). 5-HT3 receptor antagonists such as alosetron inhibit activation of non-selective cation channels which results in the modulation of serotonin-sensitive GI motor and sensory processes."
633,"For the treatment of Wilms' tumor, childhood rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma and metastatic, nonseminomatous testicular cancer as part of a combination chemotherapy and/or multi-modality treatment regimenA compound composed of a two cyclic peptides attached to a phenoxazine that is derived from streptomyces parvullus. It binds to DNA and inhibits RNA synthesis (transcription), with chain elongation more sensitive than initiation, termination, or release. As a result of impaired mRNA production, protein synthesis also declines after dactinomycin therapy. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1993, p2015)Generally, the actinomycins exert an inhibitory effect on gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and on some fungi. However, the toxic properties of the actinomycins (including dactinomycin) in relation to antibacterial activity are such as to preclude their use as antibiotics in the treatment of infectious diseases. Because the actinomycins are cytotoxic, they have an antineoplastic effect which has been demonstrated in experimental animals with various types of tumor implant. This cytotoxic action is the basis for their use in the treatment of certain types of cancer. Dactinomycin is believed to produce its cytotoxic effects by binding DNA and inhibiting RNA synthesis.Good evidence exists that this drug bind strongly, but reversibly, to DNA, interfering with synthesis of RNA (prevention of RNA polymerase elongation) and, consequently, with protein synthesis."

Azelastine has mast cell-stabilizing properties that prevent the release of interleukin-6, tryptase, histamine, and TNF-alpha[A1518] from mast cells, and has been shown to reduce mediators of mast cell degranulation such as leukotrienes in the nasal lavage of patients with rhinitis,[A1517] as well as inhibiting their production and release from eosinophils (potentially via inhibition of phospholipase A2 and leukotriene C4 synthase).[A1518,A184373] Additionally, patients using oral azelastine were observed to have significantly reduced concentrations of substance P and bradykinin in nasal secretions[A1518], both of which may play a role in nasal itching and sneezing in patients with allergic rhinitis."
635,"[L11347] Ezetimibe may also be used to reduce elevated sitosterol and campesterol in patients with homozygous sitosterolemia (phytosterolemia).[L11347]Ezetimibe is a lipid-lowering compound that inhibits intestinal cholesterol and phytosterol absorption. The discovery and research of this drug began in the early 1990s, after the intravenous administration of radiolabelled ezetimibe in rats revealed that it was being localized within enterocytes of the intestinal villi - this prompted studies investigating the effect of ezetimibe on intestinal cholesterol absorption.[A15202] Ezetimibe is used as an adjunctive therapy to a healthy diet to lower cholesterol levels in primary hyperlipidemia, mixed hyperlipidemia, homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), and homozygous sitosterolemia (phytosterolemia).[L11347]    Unlike other classes of cholesterol-reducing compounds including statins and bile acid sequestrants, ezetimibe has a distinct mechanism of action involving the sterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), and is unique in that it does not affect the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients such as fat-soluble vitamins, triglycerides, or bile acids.[A33313] In genetically NPC1L1-deficient mice, a 70% reduction in intestinal cholesterol absorption was seen, and these mice were insensitive to ezetimibe treatment - it was determined based on these findings that NPC1L1 plays an essential role in promoting intestinal cholesterol uptake via an ezetimibe-sensitive pathway.[A15202] By interfering with the intestinal uptake of cholesterol and phytosterols, ezetimibe reduces the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver.[L11347]Ezetimibe was shown to reduce the levels of total cholesterol (total-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apoprotein B (Apo B), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and triglycerides (TG), and increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in patients with hyperlipidemia.[L11347] In clinical trials involving patients with homozygous and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and in those with sitosterolemia, a recommended therapeutic dose of ezetimibe was effective in reducing the LDL levels by 15-20% while increasing HDL-C by 2.5-5%.[A33313]    The effects of increased exposure to ezetimibe secondary to moderate-severe hepatic impairment have not been assessed - patients meeting these criteria should avoid the use of ezetimibe.[L11347] Post-marketing reports indicate the potential for myopathy and rhabdomyolysis in patients taking ezetimibe, and this risk appears to be exacerbated in patients concurrently receiving, or having recently received, statin therapy.[L11347] Ezetimibe mediates its blood cholesterol-lowering effect via selectively inhibiting the absorption of cholesterol and phytosterol by the small intestine without altering the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and nutrients.[A15202] The primary target of ezetimibe is the cholesterol transport protein Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) protein. NPC1L1 is expressed on enterocytes/gut lumen (apical) as well as the hepatobiliary (canalicular) interface and plays a role in facilitating internalization of free cholesterol into the enterocyte in conjunction with the adaptor protein 2 (AP2) complex and clathrin.[A33309] Once cholesterol in the gut lumen or bile is incorporated into the cell membrane of enterocytes, it binds to the sterol-sensing domain of NPC1L1 and forms a NPC1L1/cholesterol complex. The complex is then internalized or endocytosed by joining to AP2 clathrin, forming a vesicle complex that is translocated for storage in the endocytic recycling compartment.[A33309]    Ezetimibe does not require exocrine pancreatic function for its pharmacological activity; rather, it localizes and appears to act at the brush border of the small intestine. Ezetimibe selectively blocks the NPC1L1 protein in the jejunal brush border, reducing the uptake of intestinal lumen micelles into the enterocyte.[A33309] Overall, ezetimibe causes a decrease in the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver and reduction of hepatic cholesterol stores and an increase in clearance of cholesterol from the blood. While the full mechanism of action of ezetimibe in reducing the entry of cholesterol into both enterocytes and hepatocytes is not fully understood, one study proposed that ezetimibe prevents the NPC1L1/sterol complex from interacting with AP2 in clathrin coated vesicles and induces a conformational change in NPC1L1, rendering it incapable of binding to sterols.[A33309] Another study suggested that ezetimibe disrupts the function of other protein complexes involved in regulating cholesterol uptake, including the CAV1–annexin 2 heterocomplex.[A33309]"
636,"For the reduction of blood levels and depot stores of lead in lead poisoning (acute and chronic) and lead encephalopathy, in both pediatric populations and adults.A chelating agent (chelating agents) that sequesters a variety of polyvalent cations. It is used in pharmaceutical manufacturing and as a food additive.Edetate calcium is a heavy metal chelating agent. The calcium in edetate calcium can be displaced by divalent or trivalent metals to form a stable water soluble complex that can be excreted in the urine. In theory, 1 g of edetate calcium can theoretically bind 620 mg of lead, but in reality only about 5 mg per gram is actually excreted into the urine in lead poisoned patients. In addition to chelating lead, edetate calcium also chelates and eliminates zinc from the body. Edetate calcium also binds cadmium, copper, iron and manganese, but to a much lesser extent than either lead or zinc. Edetate calcium is relatively ineffective for use in treating mercury, gold or arsenic poisoning.The pharmacologic effects of edetate calcium disodium are due to the formation of chelates with divalent and trivalent metals. A stable chelate will form with any metal that has the ability to displace calcium from the molecule, a feature shared by lead, zinc, cadmium, manganese, iron and mercury. The amounts of manganese and iron metabolized are not significant. Copper is not mobilized and mercury is unavailable for chelation because it is too tightly bound to body ligands or it is stored in inaccessible body compartments. The excretion of calcium by the body is not increased following intravenous administration of edetate calcium disodium, but the excretion of zinc is considerably increased."
637,"For as an adjunct to coumarin anticoagulants in the prevention of postoperative thromboembolic complications of cardiac valve replacement and also used in prevention of angina.A phosphodiesterase inhibitor that blocks uptake and metabolism of adenosine by erythrocytes and vascular endothelial cells. Dipyridamole also potentiates the antiaggregating action of prostacyclin. Dipyridamole is also used in myocardial perfusion imaging, as an antiplatelet agent.Dipyridamole likely inhibits both adenosine deaminase and phosphodiesterase, preventing the degradation of cAMP, an inhibitor of platelet function. This elevation in cAMP blocks the release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids and reduces thromboxane A2 activity. Dipyridamole also directly stimulates the release of prostacyclin, which induces adenylate cyclase activity, thereby raising the intraplatelet concentration of cAMP and further inhibiting platelet aggregation."
638,"For the treatment of Pneumococcal infection, acute sinusitis, acute bacterial tonsillitis, acute bronchitis and bronchiolitis, lower respiratory tract infection and lobar (pneumococcal) pneumonia.Telithromycin, a semi-synthetic erythromycin derivative, belongs to a new chemical class of antibiotics called ketolides. Ketolides have been recently added to the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin class of antibiotics. Similar to the macrolide antibiotics, telithromycin prevents bacterial growth by interfering with bacterial protein synthesis. Telithromycin binds to the 50S subunit of the 70S bacterial ribosome and blocks further peptide elongation. Binding occurs simultaneously at to two domains of 23S RNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit, domain II and V, where older macrolides bind only to one. It is used to treat mild to moderate respiratory infections.Telithromycin is a ketolide antibiotic which has an antimicrobial spectrum similar or slightly broader than that of penicillin. It is often used as an alternative in patients who have an allergy to penicillins. For respiratory tract infections, it has better coverage of atypical organisms, including mycoplasma. Telithromycin prevents bacterial growth by binding to bacterial 50S ribosomal subunits and interfering with bacterial peptide translocation and elongation.Telithromycin acts by binding to domains II and V of 23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit. By binding at domain II, telithromycin retains activity against gram-positive cocci (e.g. Streptococcus pneumoniae) in the presence of resistance mediated by methylases (erm genes) that alter the binding site at domain V. Telithromycin may also inhibit the assembly of nascent ribosomal units. Compared to erythromycin A, telithromycin binds to the 23S rRNA with 10 times greater affinity in erythromycin-susceptible organisms and 25 times greater affinity in macrolide-resistant strains. This increased binding affinity may be conferred by the C11-12 carbamate side chain of telithromycin. The  side chain appears to maintain binding at domain II in the presence of resistance mediated by alterations in domain V. "

Additionally, it has been employed for the prophylaxis of UTIs prior to surgery as well.Lomefloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic used to treat chronic bronchitis, as well as complicated and uncomplicated urinary tract infections. It is also used as a prophylactic or preventative treatment to prevent urinary tract infections in patients undergoing transrectal or transurethral surgical procedures. Flouroquinolones such as lomefloxacin possess excellent activity against gram-negative aerobic bacteria such as E.coli and Neisseria gonorrhoea as well as gram-positive bacteria including S. pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. They also posses effective activity against shigella, salmonella, campylobacter, gonococcal organisms, and multi drug resistant pseudomonas and enterobacter.Lomefloxacin is a bactericidal fluoroquinolone agent with activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. The bactericidal action of lomefloxacin results from interference with the activity of the bacterial enzymes DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, which are needed for the transcription and replication of bacterial DNA. DNA gyrase appears to be the primary quinolone target for gram-negative bacteria. Topoisomerase IV appears to be the preferential target in gram-positive organisms. Interference with these two topoisomerases results in strand breakage of the bacterial chromosome, supercoiling, and resealing. As a result DNA replication and transcription is inhibited."
641,"For the treatment of glaucoma, and in the treatment of severe anticholinergic toxicity.A cholinesterase inhibitor that is rapidly absorbed through membranes. It can be applied topically to the conjunctiva. It also can cross the blood-brain barrier and is used when central nervous system effects are desired, as in the treatment of severe anticholinergic toxicity.Physostigmine is a parasympathomimetic, specifically, a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor which effectively increases the concentration of acetylcholine at the sites of cholinergic transmission. Physostigmine is used to treat glaucoma. Because it crosses the blood-brain barrier, it is also used to treat the central nervous system effects of atropine overdose and other anticholinergic drug overdoses. Physostigmine can reverse both central and peripheral anticholinergia.Physostigmine inhibits acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of used acetylcholine. By interfering with the metabolism of acetylcholine, physostigmine indirectly stimulates both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors due to the consequential increase in available acetylcholine at the synapse."
642,"Formoterol is indicated in various formulations for the treatment of asthma and COPD.[L10619] Formoterol may also be used on an as-needed basis for prophylaxis against exercise-induced bronchospasm.[L10998]Formoterol is an inhaled beta2-agonist used in the management of COPD and asthma that was first approved for use in the United States in 2001.[L10986] It acts on bronchial smooth muscle to dilate and relax airways, and is administered as a racemic mixture of its active (R;R)- and inactive (S;S)-enantiomers.[A189528] A major clinical advantage of formoterol over other inhaled beta-agonists is its rapid onset of action (2-3 minutes), which is at least as fast as [salbutamol], combined with a long duration of action (12 hours) - for this reason, treatment guidelines for asthma recommend its use as both a reliever and maintenance medication.[L11256] It is available as a single-entity product [L10986,L11223] and in several formulations in combination with both inhaled corticosteroids [L10995,L10619] and long-acting muscarinic antagonists.[L10992,L10989]Formoterol works locally in the lungs as a bronchodilator, relaxing smooth muscle and opening up the airways. It possesses both a rapid onset of action (approximately 2-3 minutes)[A189636] and a long duration of action (up to 12 hours).[L11223] The use of long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs), such as formoterol, without concomitant inhaled corticosteroids in asthmatic patients should be avoided, as LABA monotherapy has been associated with an increased risk of asthma-related death.[L11223]Formoterol is a relatively selective long-acting agonist of beta2-adrenergic receptors,[L10986,L11223] although it does carry some degree of activity at beta1 and beta3 receptors.[A15544] Beta2 receptors are found predominantly in bronchial smooth muscle (with a relatively minor amount found in cardiac tissue) whereas beta1 receptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors found in the heart - for this reason, selectivity for beta2 receptors is desirable in the treatment of pulmonary diseases such as COPD and asthma.[L10986] Formoterol has demonstrated an approximately 200-fold greater activity at beta2 receptors over beta1 receptors.[L10986] On a molecular level, activation of beta receptors by agonists like formoterol stimulates intracellular adenylyl cyclase, an enzyme responsible for the conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP). The increased levels of cAMP in bronchial smooth muscle tissue result in relaxation of these muscles and subsequent dilation of the airways, as well as inhibition of the release of hypersensitivity mediators (e.g. histamine, leukotrienes) from culprit cells, especially mast cells.[L10986]"

It is generally prepared from alkyl ethers of estradiol to resemble testosterone but less one carbon at the 19 position. It is a schedule III drug in the U.S.Nandrolone is an anabolic steroid occurring naturally in the human body, albeit in small quantities. Nandrolone increases production and urinary excretion of erythropoietin. It may also have a direct action on bone marrow. Nandrolone binds to the androgen receptor to a greater degree than testosterone, but due to its inability to act on the muscle in ways unmediated by the receptor, has less overall effect on muscle growth.Nandrolone is an androgen receptor agonist. The drug bound to the receptor complexes which allows it to enter the nucleus and bind directly to specific nucleotide sequences of the chromosomal DNA. The areas of binding are called hormone response elements (HREs), and influence transcriptional activity of certain genes, producing the androgen effects."

646,"For the treatment of acute non-lymphocytic leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia and blast phase of chronic myelocytic leukemia.    Cytarabine is indicated in combination with [daunorubicin] for the treatment of newly-diagnosed therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC) in adults and pediatric patients 1 year and older.[L32843]A pyrimidine nucleoside analog that is used mainly in the treatment of leukemia, especially acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia. Cytarabine is an antimetabolite antineoplastic agent that inhibits the synthesis of DNA. Its actions are specific for the S phase of the cell cycle. It also has antiviral and immunosuppressant properties. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p472)Cytarabine is an antineoplastic anti-metabolite used in the treatment of several forms of leukemia including acute myelogenous leukemia and meningeal leukemia. Anti-metabolites masquerade as purine or pyrimidine - which become the building blocks of DNA. They prevent these substances becoming incorporated in to DNA during the ""S"" phase (of the cell cycle), stopping normal development and division. Cytarabine is metabolized intracellularly into its active triphosphate form (cytosine arabinoside triphosphate). This metabolite then damages DNA by multiple mechanisms, including the inhibition of alpha-DNA polymerase, inhibition of DNA repair through an effect on beta-DNA polymerase, and incorporation into DNA. The latter mechanism is probably the most important. Cytotoxicity is highly specific for the S phase of the cell cycle.Cytarabine acts through direct DNA damage and incorporation into DNA. Cytarabine is cytotoxic to a wide variety of proliferating mammalian cells in culture. It exhibits cell phase specificity, primarily killing cells undergoing DNA synthesis (S-phase) and under certain conditions blocking the progression of cells from the G1 phase to the S-phase. Although the mechanism of action is not completely understood, it appears that cytarabine acts through the inhibition of DNA polymerase. A limited, but significant, incorporation of cytarabine into both DNA and RNA has also been reported."
647,"For the correction of hemodynamic imbalances present in the shock syndrome due to myocardial infarction, trauma, endotoxic septicemia, open-heart surgery, renal failure, and chronic cardiac decompensation as in congestive failureOne of the catecholamine neurotransmitters in the brain.  It is derived from tyrosine and is the precursor to norepinephrine and epinephrine. Dopamine is a major transmitter in the extrapyramidal system of the brain, and important in regulating movement. A family of receptors (receptors, dopamine) mediate its action.Dopamine is a natural catecholamine formed by the decarboxylation of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA). It is a precursor to norepinephrine in noradrenergic nerves and is also a neurotransmitter in certain areas of the central nervous system, especially in the nigrostriatal tract, and in a few peripheral sympathetic nerves. Dopamine produces positive chronotropic and inotropic effects on the myocardium, resulting in increased heart rate and cardiac contractility. This is accomplished directly by exerting an agonist action on beta-adrenoceptors and indirectly by causing release of norepinephrine from storage sites in sympathetic nerve endings.Dopamine is a precursor to norepinephrine in noradrenergic nerves and is also a neurotransmitter in certain areas of the central nervous system.

648,"For the treatment of mild to moderate dementia associated with Parkinson's disease or of the Alzheimer's type.Rivastigmine is a parasympathomimetic or cholinergic agent for the treatment of mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer's type. Rivastigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor that inhibits both butyrylcholinesterase and acetylcholinesterase.Rivastigmine is a parasympathomimetic and a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor. An early pathophysiological feature of Alzheimer's disease that is associated with memory loss and cognitive deficits is a deficiency of acetylcholine as a result of selective loss of cholinergic neurons in the cerebral cortex, nucleus basalis, and hippocampus. Tacrine is postulated to exert its therapeutic effect by enhancing cholinergic function. While the precise mechanism of rivastigmine's action is unknown, it is postulated to exert its therapeutic effect by enhancing cholinergic function. This is accomplished by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine through reversible inhibition of its hydrolysis by cholinesterase. If this proposed mechanism is correct, rivastigmine's effect may lessen as the disease progresses and fewer cholinergic neurons remain functionally intact.Rivastigmine is a carbamate derivative that is structurally related to physostigmine, but not to donepezil and tacrine. The precise mechanism of rivastigmine has not been fully determined, but it is suggested that rivastigmine binds reversibly with and inactivates chlolinesterase (eg. acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase), preventing the hydrolysis of acetycholine, and thus leading to an increased concentration of acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses. The anticholinesterase activity of rivastigmine is relatively specific for brain acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase compared with those in peripheral tissues."
649,"For the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women whose disease has progressed following tamoxifen therapy.Exemestane is an oral steroidal aromatase inhibitor used in the adjuvant treatment of hormonally-responsive (also called hormone-receptor-positive, estrogen-responsive) breast cancer in postmenopausal women. It irreversibly binds to the active site of the enzyme resulting in permanent inhibition.Aromatase is an enzyme that converts hormones to estrogen in the body's adrenal glands. The aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are drugs that reduce estrogen levels by blocking the action of aromatase in the adrenal glands. The selective AIs (SAIs) selectively reduce levels of estrogen without interfering with levels of other steroid hormones that are produced by the adrenal gland. Drugs in this class include anastrozole (Arimidex &trade;), letrozole (Femara &trade;) and exemestane (Aromasin &trade;).Breast cancer cell growth may be estrogen-dependent. Aromatase (exemestane) is the principal enzyme that converts androgens to estrogens both in pre- and postmenopausal women. While the main source of estrogen (primarily estradiol) is the ovary in premenopausal women, the principal source of circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women is from conversion of adrenal and ovarian androgens (androstenedione and testosterone) to estrogens (estrone and estradiol) by the aromatase enzyme in peripheral tissues. Estrogen deprivation through aromatase inhibition is an effective and selective treatment for some postmenopausal patients with hormone-dependent breast cancer. Exemestane is an irreversible, steroidal aromatase inactivator, structurally related to the natural substrate androstenedione. It irreversibly binds to the active site causing permanent inhibition necessitating de novo synthesis to restore enzymatic function. Exemestane significantly lowers circulating estrogen concentrations in postmenopausal women, but has no detectable effect on the adrenal biosynthesis of corticosteroids or aldosterone. This reduction in serum and tumor concentrations of estrogen delays tumor growth and disease progression. Exemestane has no effect on other enzymes involved in the steroidogenic pathway up to a concentration at least 600 times higher than that inhibiting the aromatase enzyme."
650,"Used to relieve the inflammation, swelling, stiffness, and joint pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.Oxaprozin is a non-narcotic, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), used to relieve the inflammation, swelling, stiffness, and joint pain associated with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.Oxaprozin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with analgesic and antipyretic properties. Oxaprozin is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, dysmenorrhea, and to alleviate moderate pain.Anti-inflammatory effects of Oxaprozin are believed to be due to inhibition of cylooxygenase in platelets which leads to the blockage of prostaglandin synthesis. Antipyretic effects may be due to action on the hypothalamus, resulting in an increased peripheral blood flow, vasodilation, and subsequent heat dissipation. Oxaprozin is a non-selective NSAID, with a cell assay system showing lower COX-2 selectivity implying higher COX-1 selectivity.   "
651,"For topical use, in combination with 570 to 670 nm wavelength red light illumination, in the treatment of non-hyperkeratotic actinic keratoses of the face and scalp in immunocompetent patients when used in conjunction with lesion preparation (debridement using a sharp dermal curette).Methyl aminolevulinate is a prodrug that is metabolised to Protoporphyrin IX (a photosensitizer) used in photodynamic therapy.After topical application of methyl aminolevulinate, porphyrins will accumulate intracellularly in the treated skin lesions. The intracellular porphyrins (including PpIX) are photoactive, fluorescing compounds and, upon light activation in the presence of oxygen, singlet oxygen is formed which causes damage to cellular compartments, in particular the mitochondria. Light activation of accumulated porphyrins leads to a photochemical reaction and thereby phototoxicity to the light-exposed target cells.Photosensitization following application of methyl aminolevulinate cream occurs through the metabolic conversion of methyl aminolevulinate (prodrug) to photoactive porphyrins (PAP), which accumulates in the skin lesions to which the cream has been applied. When exposed to light of appropriate wavelength and energy, the accumulated photoactive porphyrins produce a photodynamic reaction, resulting in a cytotoxic process dependent upon the simultaneous presence of oxygen. The absorption of light results in an excited state of porphyrin molecules, and subsequent spin transfer from photoactive porphyrins to molecular oxygen generates singlet oxygen, which can further react to form superoxide and hydroxyl radicals."

653,"Oral neomycin sulfate is indicated as an adjunctive therapy in hepatic coma (portal-system encephalopathy) by reducing ammonia-forming bacteria in the intestinal tract. It is strongly recommended that oral neomycin is only used in infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria to reduce the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.[L11979]    Neomycin, in combination with polymyxin B sulfates and hydrocortisone in otic suspensions, is used in the treatment of superficial bacterial infections of the external auditory canal caused by organisms susceptible to the antibiotics. This otic formulation is also used in the treatment of infections of mastoidectomy and fenestration cavities caused by organisms susceptible to the antibiotics.[L10532]    The ophthalmic solution containing neomycin in combination with polymyxin B sulfates and dexamethasone is used to treat steroid-responsive inflammatory ocular conditions for which a corticosteroid is indicated and where bacterial infection or a risk of bacterial infection exists.[L10716]Neomycin is a broad-spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotic drug that is derived from the metabolic products of _Streptomyces fradiae_.[L11979] Neomycin is a complex comprised of three components, neomycin A, B, and C.[A191529] Neomycin B, also known as [framycetin], is the most active component of the complex and neomycin C is the isomer of neomycin B, making these two stereoisomers the active components of neomycin.[A175042,A191529] Neomycin A, or [neamine], is a moiety that conjoins two molecules of neomycin B and C together.[A175042] Neomycin is active against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms and mediates its pharmacological action by binding to bacterial ribosomes and inhibiting protein synthesis, which is crucial for the survival of bacteria.[L11985]     Neomycin sulfate is the most common form for pharmaceutical preparations; because the compound is a complex, the amount of neomycin in products is measured in units.[A191529] Neomycin sulfate as monotherapy is available in an oral solution for adjunct use in the treatment of hepatic coma.[L10716] Neomycin is also available in over-the-counter topical products to prevent minor skin infections.Neomycin mediates its bactericidal action by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis, thereby suppressing the growth and survival of susceptible bacteria. Following oral administration, the duration of bactericidal activity of neomycin ranged from 48 to 72 hours.[L11979] By decreasing colonic bacteria that produce ammonia, neomycin was shown to be effective as an adjunctive therapy in hepatic coma to improve neurologic symptoms.[L11979,L11985]     Neomycin is active against both gram positive and gram negative organisms, including the major _E. coli_ species resident in the colon as well as the enteropathogenic forms of _E. coli_.[L11985] It is also active against _Klebsiella_-_Enterobacter_ group.[L11979] Resistant strains of _E. coli_, _Klebsiella_ and _Proteus spp_. may emerge from neomycin therapy.[A191529] Neomycin has no antifungal activity and has some activity against some protozoa.[A175042]Like other aminoglycoside antibiotic drugs, neomycin inhibits bacterial ribosomes by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit of susceptible bacteria and disrupting the translational machinery of bacterial protein synthesis.[A15783,T28] Bacterial translation is normally initiated by the mRNA binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit and subsequent binding with 50S subunit for elongation.[T28]"
654,"Used in the treatment of active, progressive or destructive forms of inflammatory arthritis, such as adult rheumatoid arthritis.Auranofin is a gold salt that is capable of eliciting pharmacologic actions that suppress inflammation and stimulate cell-mediated immunity. It has subsequently been listed by the World Health Organization as a member of the antirheumatic agent category. Auranofin appears to induce heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) mRNA. Heme oxygenase 1 is an inducible heme-degrading enzyme with anti-inflammatory properties.Auranofin is a gold salt used in treating inflammatory arthritis. Gold salts are called second-line drugs because they are often considered when the arthritis progresses in spite of antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs and corticosteroids).Inflammatory arthritis can cause joint swelling, warmth, pain, and tenderness; one cause of this condition is rheumatoid arthritis.[L32358] In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, gold salts such as auranofin can be administered to decrease joint inflammation and prevent the destruction of bones and cartilage. Though the mechanism of action of auranofin is not fully established in rheumatoid arthritis, this drug has been shown to inhibit phagocytosis and the release of antibodies and enzymes that play a role in cytotoxic reactions, suppressing the inflammatory response.[A230888,A230968]     Aside from its probable immune effects in inflammatory arthritis, studies have shown that auranofin inhibits thioredoxin reductase. This enzyme has various roles in cell homeostasis, including the regulation of free radicals.[A230888,A230928] Thioredoxin reductase can be over expressed in various types of tumours, rendering it an attractive target for anticancer drug development.[A230943] Studies have shown that inhibiting thioredoxin reductase can cause oxidative stress and apoptosis of tumour cells by increasing the formation of free radicals. Aurofin's thiol ligand binds with high affinity to thiol and selenol groups, forming irreversible reaction products.[A230888] One study showed that treatment with auranofin increased the production or reactive oxygen species and caused elevation of intracellular calcium concentration in platelets, leading to cell death.[A230943] Another study showed that auranofin enhanced the production of free radicals, governing T-cell activation.[A230893]"
655,"In the United States, gabapentin is officially indicated for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia in adults and for the adjunctive treatment of partial-onset seizures, with or without secondary generalization, in patients 3 years of age and older.[L8717] In Europe, gabapentin is indicated for adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures, with or without secondary generalization, in patients 6 years of age and older and as monotherapy in patients 12 years of age and older. It is also used in adults for the treatment of various types of peripheral neuropathic pain, such as painful diabetic neuropathy.[L8732]Gabapentin is a structural analogue of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid ([GABA]) that was first approved for use in the United States in 1993.[L8717] It was originally developed as a novel anti-epileptic for the treatment of certain types of seizures[A186277,A186143] - today it is also widely used to treat neuropathic pain.[A14097,A186179] Gabapentin has some stark advantages as compared with other anti-epileptics, such as a relatively benign adverse effect profile, wide therapeutic index, and lack of appreciable metabolism making it unlikely to participate in pharmacokinetic drug interactions.[A186143,A185981,L8717]. It is structurally and functionally related to another GABA derivative, [pregabalin].Gabapentin is an anti-convulsant medication that inhibits the release of excitatory neurotransmitters, allowing for its use against pathologic neurotransmission such as that seen in neuropathic pain and seizure disorders.[L8717,L8732] It has a wide therapeutic index, with doses in excess of 8000 mg/kg failing to cause a fatal reaction in rats.[L8765]    Gabapentin is ineffective in absence seizures and should be used in caution in patients with mixed seizure disorders involving absence seizures. Gabapentin has been associated with drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), otherwise known as multi-organ hypersensitivity. This reaction can prove fatal and early symptoms such as fever, lymphadenopathy, and rash should be promptly investigated.[L8717,L8720,L8732]The precise mechanism through which gabapentin exerts its therapeutic effects is unclear.[L8717,L8720] The primary mode of action appears to be at the auxillary α2δ-1 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels (though a low affinity for the α2δ-2 subunit has also been reported).[A186179,A14097,A186277] The major function of these subunits is to facilitate the movement of pore-forming α1 subunits of calcium channels from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell membrane of pre-synaptic neurons.[A186179] There is evidence that chronic pain states can cause an increase in the expression of α2δ subunits and that these changes correlate with hyperalgesia.[A14097] Gabapentin appears to inhibit the action of α2δ-1 subunits, thus decreasing the density of pre-synaptic voltage-gated calcium channels and subsequent release of excitatory neurotransmitters.[A186179] It is likely that this inhibition is also responsible for the anti-epileptic action of gabapentin.[A186277]    There is some evidence that gabapentin also acts on adenosine receptors[A11009, A186209] and voltage-gated potassium channels,[A186212] though the clinical relevance of its action at these sites is unclear."
656,"Doxorubicin is indicated for the treatment of neoplastic conditions like acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloblastic leukemia, Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, metastatic breast cancer, metastatic Wilms’ tumor, metastatic neuroblastoma, metastatic soft tissue and bone sarcomas, metastatic ovarian carcinoma, metastatic transitional cell bladder carcinoma, metastatic thyroid carcinoma, metastatic gastric carcinoma, and metastatic bronchogenic carcinoma.[L45231] Doxorubicin is also indicated for use as a component of adjuvant therapy in women with evidence of axillary lymph node involvement following resection of primary breast cancer.[L45231] For the liposomal formulation, doxorubicin is indicated for the treatment of ovarian cancer that has progressed or recurred after platinum-based chemotherapy, AIDS-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma after the failure of prior systemic chemotherapy or intolerance to such therapy, and multiple myeloma in combination with bortezomib in patients who have not previously received bortezomib and have received at least one prior therapy.[L45226]Doxorubicin is a cytotoxic anthracycline antibiotic isolated from cultures of Streptomyces peucetius var. caesius along side with daunorubicin, another cytotoxic agent, in 1970.[A1575,A257709,A257614] Although they both have aglyconic and sugar moieties, doxorubicin's side chain terminates with a primary alcohol group compared to the methyl group of daunorubicin.[A257709] Although its detailed molecular mechanisms have yet to be understood, doxorubicin is generally thought to exert its effect through DNA intercalation, which eventually leads to DNA damage and the generation of reactive oxygen species.[A257614] Thanks to its efficacy and broad effect, doxorubicin was approved by the FDA in 1974 to treat a variety of cancer, including but not limited to breast, lung, gastric, ovarian, thyroid, non-Hodgkin’s and Hodgkin’s lymphoma, multiple myeloma, sarcoma, and pediatric cancers.[A1573,A257614,L45231] However, one of the major side effects of doxorubicin is cardiotoxicity, which excludes patients with poor heart function and requires treatment termination once the maximally tolerated cumulative dose is reached.[A257719]Doxorubicin is a cytotoxic, cell-cycle non-specific anthracycline antibiotic.[A1574,A257674] It is generally thought to exert its antitumor effect by destabilizing DNA structures through intercalation, thus introducing DNA strand breakages and damages.[A257664,A18538,A257674] Not only does it alter the transcriptomes of the cells, failure in repairing DNA structures can also initiate the apoptotic pathways.[A257674,A257679] Additionally, doxorubicin intercalation can also interfere with vital enzyme activity, such as topoisomerase II, DNA polymerase, and RNA polymerase, leading to cell cycle arrests.[A257674] Finally, doxorubicin can also generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species to exert cellular damages.[A257584]Generally, doxorubicin is thought to exert its antineoplastic activity through 2 primary mechanisms: intercalation into DNA and disrupt topoisomerase-mediated repairs and free radicals-mediated cellular damages.[A257614]    Doxorubicin can intercalate into DNA through the anthraquinone ring, which stabilizes the complex by forming hydrogen bonds with DNA bases.[A257659] Intercalation of doxorubicin can introduce torsional stress into the polynucleotide structure, thus destabilizing nucleosome structures and leading to nucleosome eviction and replacement.[A257664,A18538] Additionally, the doxorubicin-DNA complex can interfere with topoisomerase II enzyme activity by preventing relegation of topoisomerase-mediated DNA breaks, thus inhibiting replication and transcription and inducing apoptosis.[A257669,A257674]     Moreover, doxorubicin can be metabolized by microsomal NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase into a semiquinone radical, which can be reoxidized in the presence of oxygen to form oxygen radicals.[A1579,A257584] Reactive oxygen species have been known to cause cellular damage through various mechanisms, including lipid peroxidation and membrane damage, DNA damage, oxidative stress, and apoptosis.[A257634] Although free radicals generated from this pathway can be deactivated by catalase and superoxide dismutase, tumor and myocardial cells tend to lack these enzymes, thus explaining doxorubicin's effectiveness against cancer cells and tendency to cause cardiotoxicity.[A1579,A257584,A1578]  "
657,"For the acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without aura in adults. Frovatriptan is a triptan drug developed by Vernalis for the treatment of migraine headaches, in particular those associated with menstruation. Frovatriptan causes vasoconstriction of arteries and veins that supply blood to the head. Frovatriptan is a second generation triptan 5-HT receptor agonist that binds with high affinity for 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors. It is structurally distinct from, but pharmacologically related to other selective 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonists. Frovatriptan has no significant effects on GABAA mediated channel activity and has no significant affinity for benzodiazepine binding sites. Frovatriptan is believed to act on extracerebral, intracranial arteries and to inhibit excessive dilation of these vessels in migraine. Research has shown that migraine can be caused by the swelling of blood vessels around the brain. Frovatriptan eases the pain associated with migraine by narrowing these blood vessels. Frovatriptan has one of the highest affinities for the 5-HT1B of the second-generation triptan agonists. Three distinct pharmacological actions have been implicated in the antimigraine effect of the triptans: (1) stimulation of presynaptic 5-HT1D receptors, which serves to inhibit both dural vasodilation and inflammation; (2) direct inhibition of trigeminal nuclei cell excitability via 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonism in the brainstem and (3) vasoconstriction of meningeal, dural, cerebral or pial vessels as a result of vascular 5-HT1B receptor agonism."
658,"Hydrochlorothiazide is indicated alone or in combination for the management of edema associated with congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, acute glomerulonephritis, chronic renal failure, and corticosteroid and estrogen therapy.[L8447,L8450] Hydrochlorothiazide is also indicated alone or in combination for the management of hypertension.[A185138,L8447,L8450,L45663]Hydrochlorothiazide is the most commonly prescribed thiazide diuretic.[A185138] It is indicated to treat edema and hypertension.[A185138,L8447,L8450] Hydrochlorothiazide use is common but declining in favour of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.[A185138] Many combination products are available containing hydrochlorothiazide and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors[L8390,L8423] or angiotensin II receptor blockers.[L7426,L7459]    Hydrochlorothiazide was granted FDA approval on 12 February 1959.[L8444]Hydrochlorothiazide prevents the reabsorption of sodium and water from the distal convoluted tubule, allowing for the increased elimination of water in the urine.[A185138,A185180,A16730,L8447,L8450] Hydrochlorothiazide has a wide therapeutic window as dosing is individualized and can range from 25-100mg.[L8447,L8450] Hydrochlorothiazide should be used with caution in patients with reduced kidney or liver function.[L8447,L8450]Hydrochlorothiazide is transported from the circulation into epithelial cells of the distal convoluted tubule by the organic anion transporters OAT1, OAT3, and OAT4.[A185204,A185180] From these cells, hydrochlorothiazide is transported to the lumen of the tubule by multidrug resistance associated protein 4 (MRP4).[A185204]    Normally, sodium is reabsorbed into epithelial cells of the distal convoluted tubule and pumped into the basolateral interstitium by a sodium-potassium ATPase, creating a concentration gradient between the epithelial cell and the distal convoluted tubule that promotes the reabsorption of water.[A16730]    Hydrochlorothiazide acts on the proximal region of the distal convoluted tubule, inhibiting reabsorption by the sodium-chloride symporter, also known as Solute Carrier Family 12 Member 3 (SLC12A3).[A185138,A185180,A16730] Inhibition of SLC12A3 reduces the magnitude of the concentration gradient between the epithelial cell and distal convoluted tubule, reducing the reabsorption of water.[A16730]"
659,"For the treatment of bacterial infections caused by susceptible organisms.A cyclohexylamido analog of penicillanic acid.Cyclacillin, a penicillin, is a cyclohexylamido analog of penicillanic acid. Cyclacillin is more resistant to beta-lactamase hydrolysis than ampicillin, is much better absorbed when given by mouth and, as a result, the levels reached in the blood and in the urine are considerably higher than those obtained with the same dose of ampicillin. Cyclacillin has been replaced by newer penicillin treatments.The bactericidal activity of cyclacillin results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Cyclacillin is stable in the presence of a variety of b-lactamases, including penicillinases and some cephalosporinases."
660,"Salbutamol is indicated for (i) the symptomatic relief and prevention of bronchospasm due to bronchial asthma, chronic bronchitis, reversible obstructive airway disease, and other chronic bronchopulmonary disorders in which bronchospasm is a complicating factor, and/or (ii) the acute prophylaxis against exercise-induced bronchospasm and other stimuli known to induce bronchospasm.[Label,F3265,F3268]Salbutamol is a short-acting, selective beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist used in the treatment of asthma and COPD. It is 29 times more selective for beta2 receptors than beta1 receptors giving it higher specificity for pulmonary beta receptors versus beta1-adrenergic receptors located in the heart. Salbutamol is formulated as a racemic mixture of the R- and S-isomers. The R-isomer has 150 times greater affinity for the beta2-receptor than the S-isomer and the S-isomer has been associated with toxicity. This lead to the development of levalbuterol, the single R-isomer of salbutamol. However, the high cost of levalbuterol compared to salbutamol has deterred wide-spread use of this enantiomerically pure version of the drug. Salbutamol is generally used for acute episodes of bronchospasm caused by bronchial asthma, chronic bronchitis and other chronic bronchopulmonary disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD). It is also used prophylactically for exercise-induced asthma.[Label,A174379,A174400]Salbutamol (INN) or albuterol (USAN), a moderately selective beta(2)-receptor agonist similar in structure to terbutaline, is widely used as a bronchodilator to manage asthma and other chronic obstructive airway diseases.[Label,F3265,F3268] The R-isomer, levalbuterol, is responsible for bronchodilation while the S-isomer increases bronchial reactivity.[A174400] The R-enantiomer is available and sold in its pure form as levalbuterol and subsequently may produce fewer side-effects with only the R-enantiomer present - although this has not been formally demonstrated.[A174400]    After oral and parenteral administration, stimulation of the beta receptors in the body, both beta-1 and beta-2, occurs because (a) beta-2 selectivity is not absolute, and (b) higher concentrations of salbutamol occur in the regions of these receptors with these modes of administration.[Label,F3265,F3268] This results in the beta-1 effect of cardiac stimulation, though not so much as with isoprenaline, and beta-2 effects of peripheral vasodilatation and hypotension, skeletal muscle tremor, and uterine muscle relaxation.[Label,F3265,F3268]    Metabolic effects such as hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia also may occur, although it is not known whether these effects are mediated by beta-1 or beta-2 receptors.[Label,F3265,F3268] The serum potassium levels have a tendency to fall.[F3265]In vitro studies and in vivo pharmacologic studies have shown that salbutamol has a preferential effect on beta2-adrenergic receptors compared with isoproterenol.[Label,F3265,F3268] Although beta2­ adrenoceptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle and beta1 adrenoceptors are the predominant receptors in the heart, there are also beta2-adrenoceptors in the human heart comprising 10% to 50% of the total beta-adrenoceptors.[Label,F3265,F3268] The precise function of these receptors has not been established, but their presence raises the possibility that even selective beta2-agonists may have cardiac effects.[Label,F3265,F3268]    Activation of beta2-adrenergic receptors on airway smooth muscle leads to the activation of adenyl cyclase and to an increase in the intracellular concentration of cyclic-3′,5′-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP).[Label,F3265,F3268] This increase of cyclic AMP leads to the activation of protein kinase A, which inhibits the phosphorylation of myosin and lowers intracellular ionic calcium concentrations, resulting in relaxation.[Label,F3265,F3268] Salbutamol relaxes the smooth muscles of all airways, from the trachea to the terminal bronchioles.[Label,F3265,F3268] Salbutamol acts as a functional antagonist to relax the airway irrespective of the spasmogen involved, thus protecting against all bronchoconstrictor challenges.[Label,F3265,F3268] Increased cyclic AMP concentrations are also associated with the inhibition of release of mediators from mast cells in the airway.[Label,F3265,F3268]    Salbutamol has been shown in most controlled clinical trials to have more effect on the respiratory tract, in the form of bronchial smooth muscle relaxation, than isoproterenol at comparable doses while producing fewer cardiovascular effects.[Label,F3265,F3268] Controlled clinical studies and other clinical experience have shown that inhaled albuterol, like other beta-adrenergic agonist drugs, can produce a significant cardiovascular effect in some patients, as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, symptoms, and/or electrocardiographic changes.[Label,F3265,F3268]    A measurable decrease in airway resistance is typically observed within 5 to 15 minutes after inhalation of salbutamol.[Label,F3265,F3268] The maximum improvement in pulmonary function usually occurs 60 to 90 minutes after salbutamol treatment, and significant bronchodilator activity has been observed to persist for 3 to 6 hours.[Label,F3265,F3268] "
661,"For the production of local or regional anesthesia for surgery and obstetrics, and for post-operative pain managementLevobupivacaine is an amino-amide local anaesthetic drug belonging to the family of n-alkylsubstituted  pipecoloxylidide. It is the S-enantiomer of bupivacaine. Levobupivacaine hydrochloride is commonly marketed by AstraZeneca under the trade name Chirocaine. In particular, the specific levobupivacaine enantiomer is a worthwhile pursuit because it demonstrates less vasodilation and possesses a greater length of action in comparison to bupivacaine. It is approximately 13 per cent less potent (by molarity) than racemic bupivacaine.Levobupivacaine is indicated for local anaesthesia including infiltration, nerve block, ophthalmic, epidural and intrathecal anaesthesia in adults; and infiltration analgesia in children. When administered appropriately, the occurrence of adverse effects is not anticipated much if at all. In general, the majority of potential adverse effects are predominantly associated with inappropriate administration methods that may cause systemic exposure and/or toxicity associated with overexposure to an anesthetic. Regardless, allergic reactions may also occur - although only rarely.Levobupivacaine, a local anesthetic agent, is indicated for the production of local or regional anesthesia or analgesia for surgery, for oral surgery procedures, for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, and for obstetrical procedures.Local anesthetics such as Levobupivacaine block the generation and the conduction of nerve impulses, presumably by increasing the threshold for electrical excitation in the nerve, by slowing the propagation of the nerve impulse, and by reducing the rate of rise of the action potential. In general, the progression of anesthesia is related to the diameter, myelination and conduction velocity of affected nerve fibers. Specifically, the drug binds to the intracellular portion of sodium channels and blocks sodium influx into nerve cells, which prevents depolarization."
662,"For induction and maintenance in the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in immunocompromised patients, including patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Also used in the treatment of severe cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease, including CMV pneumonia, CMV gastrointestinal disease, and disseminated CMV infections, in immunocompromised patients.An acyclovir analog that is a potent inhibitor of the Herpesvirus family including cytomegalovirus. Ganciclovir is used to treat complications from AIDS-associated cytomegalovirus infections.Ganciclovir is a synthetic nucleoside analogue of 2'-deoxyguanosine that inhibits replication of herpes viruses both in vitro andin vivo. Sensitive human viruses include cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus -1 and -2 (HSV-1, HSV-2), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV), however clinical studies have been limited to assessment of efficacy in patients with CMV infection. Ganciclovir is a prodrug that is structurally similar to acyclovir. It inhibits virus replication by its encorporation into viral DNA. This encorporation inhibits dATP and leads to defective DNA, ceasing or retarding the viral machinery required to spread the virus to other cells.Ganciclovir's antiviral activity inhibits virus replication. This inhibitory action is highly selective as the drug must be converted to the active form by a virus-encoded cellular enzyme, thymidine kinase (TK). TK catalyzes phosphorylation of ganciclovir to the monophosphate, which is then subsequently converted into the diphosphate by cellular guanylate kinase and into the triphosphate by a number of cellular enzymes. In vitro, ganciclovir triphosphate stops replication of herpes viral DNA. When used as a substrate for viral DNA polymerase, ganciclovir triphosphate competitively inhibits dATP leading to the formation of 'faulty' DNA. This is where ganciclovir triphosphate is incorporated into the DNA strand replacing many of the adenosine bases. This results in the prevention of DNA synthesis, as phosphodiester bridges can longer to be built, destabilizing the strand. Ganciclovir inhibits viral DNA polymerases more effectively than it does cellular polymerase, and chain elongation resumes when ganciclovir is removed."
663,"Hydroxyurea is indicated to reduce the frequency of painful crises and to reduce the need for blood transfusions in adult and pediatric patients, 2 years of age and older, with sickle cell anemia with recurrent moderate to severe painful crises.[L41150]Hydroxyurea is a non-alkylating antineoplastic agent that was first synthesized in 1869 but was not characterized biologically until 1928.[A262596] It was first approved by the FDA in 1998 for the treatment of sickle cell anemia in adults.[A262601] Although clinical evidence on the efficacy of hydroxyurea in certain conditions exists, hydroxyurea is used sparingly in clinical settings, largely due to lack of knowledge and adherence, the need for therapeutic monitoring, and serious side effects of secondary cancer and birth defects.[A262606]The correlation between hydroxyurea concentrations, reduction of crisis rate, and increase in HbF, is not known.[L49181]The precise mechanism by which hydroxyurea produces its antineoplastic effects cannot, at present, be described. However, the reports of various studies in rat and human tissue cultures lend support to the hypothesis that hydroxyurea causes an immediate inhibition of DNA synthesis, by acting as a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, without interfering with the synthesis of ribonucleic acid or of protein. Hydroxyurea probably acts by decreasing the rate of conversion of ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides. This effect is particularly apparent in cells with a high rate of proliferation.[L47142] Particularly, hydroxyurea reduces the tyrosyl free radical at the active site of the M2 via a one-electron transfer reaction through the –NH2-OH moiety.[A262596]    Three mechanisms have been postulated for the potentiation of the therapeutic effects of irradiation by hydroxyurea on squamous cell (epidermoid) carcinomas of the head and neck. In vitro studies utilizing Chinese hamster cells suggest that hydroxyurea is lethal to normally radioresistant S-stage cells and holds other cells of the cell cycle in the G1 or pre-DNA synthesis stage where they are most susceptible to the effects of irradiation. The third mechanism of action has been theorized on the basis of in vitro studies of HeLa cells: it appears that hydroxyurea, by inhibition of DNA synthesis, hinders the normal repair process of cells damaged but not killed by irradiation, thereby decreasing their survival rate; there is no alteration of RNA and protein syntheses.[L47142]    Another proposed mechanism of action of hydroxyurea is the elevation of HbF concentrations in Sickle Cell Disease patients. HbF interferes with the polymerization of HbS (sickle haemoglobin) and thus impedes the sickling of red blood cell. Recently, hydroxyurea has shown to be associated with the generation of nitric oxide, suggesting that nitric oxide stimulates cyclic guanosine monophosphates (cGMP) production, which then activates a protein kinase and increases the production of HbF. Other known pharmacological effects of hydroxycarbamide which may contribute to its beneficial effects in Sickle Cell Disease include decrease of neutrophils, improved deformability of sickled cells, and altered adhesion of red blood cells to the endothelium.[L47137]  "
664,"Letrozole is indicated to treat postmenopausal women with hormone receptor (HR) positive early breast cancer, postmenopausal women with early breast cancer who have periviously been treated with tamoxifen, and postmenopausal women with HR+ or unknown advanced breast cancer.[L11626]Letrozole, or CGS 20267, is an oral non-steroidal type II aromatase inhibitor first described in the literature in 1990.[A190543,A1559,L11623,L11626] It is a third generation aromatase inhibitor like [exemestane] and [anastrozole], meaning it does not significantly affect cortisol, aldosterone, and thyroxine.[A190546]    Letrozole was granted FDA approval on 25 July 1997.[L11623]Letrozole is an aromatase inhibitor used in the treatment of breast cancer. Aromatase inhibitors work by inhibiting the action of the enzyme aromatase, which converts androgens into estrogens by a process called aromatization. As breast tissue is stimulated by estrogens, decreasing their production is a way of suppressing recurrence of the breast tumor tissue.    Letrozole is a third generation type II aromatase inhibitor used to treat estrogen dependant breast cancers.[L11623] It has a long duration of action as it has a half life of over 42 hours in breast cancer patients.[A190546,A190555,L11623] Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of interstitial lung disease, pneumonitis, QT prolongation, elevated transaminase levels, neutropenia, and embryo-fetal toxicity.[L11623]Letrozole is a non-steroidal type II aromatase inhibitor.[A1559] It blocks the active site, and therefore the electron transfer chain of CYP19A1.[A1559] This competitive inhibition prevents the conversion of androgens to estrogen.[A1559] This action leads to a reduction in uterine weight and elevated leuteinizing hormone.[L11623] In postmenopausal women, the action of aromatase is responsible for the majority of estrogen production.[L11623] With reduced availability of estrogen, estrogen-dependant tumors regress.[L11623] Third generation aromatase inhibitors do not significantly affect cortisol, aldosterone, and thyroxine levels.[A190546]"
665,"For the local treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (moniliasis). Tioconazole is an imidazole antifungal used to treat fungal and yeast infections. Topical formulations are used for ringworm, jock itch, athlete’s foot, and tinea versicolor or “sun fungus”. Tioconazole interacts with 14-alpha demethylase, a cytochrome P-450 enzyme that converts lanosterol to ergosterol, an essential component of the yeast membrane. In this way, tioconazole inhibits ergosterol synthesis, resulting in increased cellular permeability. Tioconazole is a broad-spectrum imidazole antifungal agent that inhibits the growth of human pathogenic yeasts. Tioconazole exhibits fungicidal activity in vitro against Candida albicans, other species of the genus Candida, and against Torulopsis glabrata. Tioconazole prevents the growth and function of some fungal organisms by interfering with the production of substances needed to preserve the cell membrane. In addition to its broad spectrum antifungal effects with tioconazole being effective against commonly occurring dermatophyte and yeast-like fungal species, tioconazole also has antibacterial effects on certain Gram-positive cocci bacteria. Tioconazole interacts with 14-alpha demethylase, a cytochrome P-450 enzyme that converts lanosterol to ergosterol, an essential component of the yeast membrane. In this way, tioconazole inhibits ergosterol synthesis, resulting in increased cellular permeability. Tioconazole may also inhibit endogenous respiration, interact with membrane phospholipids, inhibit the transformation of yeasts to mycelial forms and the uptake of purine, impair triglyceride and/or phospholipid biosynthesis, and inhibit the movement of calcium and potassium ions across the cell membrane by blocking the ion transport pathway known as the Gardos channel."
666," It is also used as a component of pretransplant conditioning regimens in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation for acute myeloid leukemia and nonmalignant diseases.Busulfan is a bifunctional alkylating agent, having a selective immunosuppressive effect on bone marrow. It is not a structural analog of the nitrogen mustards. It has been used in the palliative treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (myeloid leukemia, chronic), but although symptomatic relief is provided, no permanent remission is brought about. According to the Fourth Annual Report on Carcinogens (NTP 85-002, 1985), busulfan is listed as a known carcinogen.Busulfan is an antineoplastic in the class of alkylating agents and is used to treat various forms of cancer. Alkylating agents are so named because of their ability to add alkyl groups to many electronegative groups under conditions present in cells. They stop tumor growth by cross-linking guanine bases in DNA double-helix strands - directly attacking DNA. This makes the strands unable to uncoil and separate. As this is necessary in DNA replication, the cells can no longer divide. In addition, these drugs add methyl or other alkyl groups onto molecules where they do not belong which in turn leads to a miscoding of DNA. Alkylating agents are cell cycle-nonspecific and work by three different mechanisms, all of which achieve the same end result - disruption of DNA function and cell death. Overexpression of MGST2, a glutathione s-transferase, is thought to confer resistance to busulfan. The role of MGST2 in the metabolism of busulfan is unknown however. Busulfan is an alkylating agent that contains 2 labile methanesulfonate groups attached to opposite ends of a 4-carbon alkyl chain. Once busulfan is hydrolyzed, the methanesulfonate groups are released and carbonium ions are produced. These carbonium ions alkylate DNA, which results in the interference of DNA replication and RNA transcription, ultimately leading to the disruption of nucleic acid function. Specifically, its mechanism of action through alkylation produces guanine-adenine intrastrand crosslinks. These crosslinks occur through a SN2 reaction guanine N7 nucleophilically attacks the carbon adjacent to the mesylate leaving group. This kind of damage cannot be repaired by cellular machinery and thus the cell undergoes apoptosis."
667,"For symptomatic treatment of acute and chronic rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, primary dysmenorrhea and mild to moderate pain associated with musculotendinous trauma (sprains and strains), postoperative (including dental surgery) or postpartum pain.Ketoprofen, a propionic acid derivative, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAIA) with analgesic and antipyretic properties.Ketoprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAIA) with analgesic and antipyretic properties. Ketoprofen has pharmacologic actions similar to those of other prototypical NSAIDs, which inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. Ketoprofen is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, dysmenorrhea, and alleviate moderate pain.The anti-inflammatory effects of ketoprofen are believed to be due to inhibition cylooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an enzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis via the arachidonic acid pathway. This results in decreased levels of prostaglandins that mediate pain, fever and inflammation. Ketoprofen is a non-specific cyclooxygenase inhibitor and inhibition of COX-1 is thought to confer some of its side effects, such as GI upset and ulceration. Ketoprofen is thought to have anti-bradykinin activity, as well as lysosomal membrane-stabilizing action. Antipyretic effects may be due to action on the hypothalamus, resulting in an increased peripheral blood flow, vasodilation, and subsequent heat dissipation. "
668,"Used as a diagnostic drug for testing hypothalamic-pituitary ACTH function. Occasionally used in Cushing's syndrome.An inhibitor of the enzyme steroid 11-beta-monooxygenase. It is used as a test of the feedback hypothalamic-pituitary mechanism in the diagnosis of cushing syndrome.Metopirone is an inhibitor of endogenous adrenal corticosteroid synthesis.The pharmacological effect of Metopirone is to reduce cortisol and corticosterone production by inhibiting the 11-&szlig;-hydroxylation reaction in the adrenal cortex. Removal of the strong inhibitory feedback mechanism exerted by cortisol results in an increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) production by the pituitary. With continued blockade of the enzymatic steps leading to production of cortisol and corticosterone, there is a marked increase in adrenocortical secretion of their immediate precursors, 11-desoxycortisol and desoxycorticosterone, which are weak suppressors of ACTH release, and a corresponding elevation of these steroids in the plasma and of their metabolites in the urine. These metabolites are readily determined by measuring urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids (17-OHCS) or 17-ketogenic steroids (17-KGS). Because of these actions, metopirone is used as a diagnostic test, with urinary 17-OHCS measured as an index of pituitary ACTH responsiveness. Metopirone may also suppress biosynthesis of aldosterone, resulting in a mild natriuresis."
669,"For the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease who are on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Also for the treatment of hypercalcemia in patients with parathyroid carcinoma.Cinacalcet is a calcimimetic sold by Amgen under the trade name Sensipar® in North America and Australia and as Mimpara® in Europe. It is used to treat hyperparathyroidism due to parathyroid tumours or renal failure.Cinacalcet is a drug that acts as a calcimimetic (i.e. it mimics the action of calcium on tissues). Secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive disease, associated with increases in parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels and derangements in calcium and phosphorus metabolism. Increased PTH stimulates osteoclastic activity resulting in cortical bone resorption and marrow fibrosis. The goals of treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism are to lower levels of PTH, calcium, and phosphorus in the blood, in order to prevent progressive bone disease and the systemic consequences of disordered mineral metabolism. In CKD patients on dialysis with uncontrolled secondary HPT, reductions in PTH are associated with a favorable impact on bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP), bone turnover and bone fibrosis. Cinacalcet reduces calcium levels by increasing the sensitivity of the calcium sensing receptor to extracellular calcium.Cinacalcet directly lowers parathyroid hormone levels by increasing the sensitivity of the calcium sensing receptors to activation by extracellular calcium, resulting in the inhibition of PTH secretion. The reduction in PTH is associated with a concomitant decrease in serum calcium levels."

671,"For the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis.Balsalazide is an anti-inflammatory drug used in the treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease. It is sold under the name ""Colazal"" in the US and ""Colazide"" in the UK.    The chemical name is (E)-5-[[-4-(2-carboxyethyl) aminocarbonyl] phenyl]azo] -2-hydroxybenzoic acid. It is usually administered as the disodium salt.    Balsalazide works by deliverying mesalazine to the large intestine to act directly on ulcerative colitis. Mesalazine is also known as 5-aminosalicylic acid, or 5-ASA.Balsalazide is a prodrug that has little or no pharmacologic activity until it is enzymatically cleaved in the colon to produce mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid), an anti inflammatory drug indicated for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. Balsalazide disodium is delivered intact to the colon where it is cleaved by bacterial azoreduction to release equimolar quantities of mesalamine, which is the therapeutically active portion of the molecule, and the intert 4-aminobenzoyl-(beta)-alanine. As a result, the spectrum of pharmacologic activity of balsalazide is similar to that of mesalamine.The mechanism of action of 5-aminosalicylic acid is unknown, but appears exert its anti-inflammatory effects locally (in the GI tract) rather than systemically. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways (catalyzes the formation of prostaglandin precursors from arachidonic acid), and through the lipoxygenase pathways (catalyzes the formation of leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids from arachidonic acid and its metabolites), is increased in patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Therefore, it is possible that 5-aminosalicylic acid diminishes inflammation by blocking production of arachidonic acid metabolites in the colon through both the inhibition of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase."

It is generally given in combination with [trimethoprim], a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor, which inhibits the reduction of dihydrofolic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid.[L11830] Studies have shown that bacterial resistance develops more slowly with the combination of the two drugs than with either trimethoprim or sulfamethoxazole alone, as together they inhibit sequential steps in the bacterial folate synthesis pathway.[L11830]    Sulfonamides, including sulfamethoxazole, have been implicated in hypersensitivity reactions - these agents should be discontinued at the first sign of a developing rash, as this may signal the start of a more severe reaction such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis. Sulfamethoxazole treatment may contribute to folate deficiency and should therefore be used with caution in patients at a higher risk of developing a deficiency. Hemolysis has been observed in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency who are using sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim.[L11830]Sulfamethoxazole is a sulfonamide that inhibits bacterial dihydrofolic acid synthesis due to its structural similarity to an endogenous substrate, para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA).[A187343,A187364] Most bacteria meet their need for folic acid by synthesizing it from PABA, as opposed to Animalia that require exogenous folic acid sources.[L11851] Sulfamethoxazole competitively inhibits dihydropteroate synthase, the enzyme responsible for bacterial conversion of PABA to dihydrofolic acid.[A112882] Inhibition of this pathway prevents the synthesis of tetrahydrofolate and, ultimately, the synthesis of bacterial purines and DNA, resulting in a bacteriostatic effect.[A187340]"

676,"Isosorbide mononitrate is indicated for the prevention and management of angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease. The onset of action of oral isosorbide mononitrate is not sufficiently rapid to be useful in aborting an acute anginal episode.[L11698]Isosorbide mononitrate is an organic nitrate with vasodilating properties. It is an anti-anginal agent that works by relaxing the smooth muscles of both arteries and veins, but but predominantly veins to reduce cardiac preload.[L11698, L11743] Isosorbide mononitrate is an active metabolite of [isosorbide dinitrate]. Like other organic nitrates, isosorbide mononitrate acts as a prodrug for its active metabolite, [nitric oxide], which mediates the therapeutic action of isosorbide mononitrate.[L11743] Isosorbide mononitrate has a longer duration of action than [nitroglycerin] due to its slow onset of absorption and metabolism.[T28]    First approved by the FDA in 1991,[L11743] isosorbide mononitrate is used for the prevention and management of angina pectoris caused by coronary artery disease; however, the onset of action of orally-administered isosorbide mononitrate is not rapid enough to offset an acute anginal episode.[L11698] It is available in oral tablets generically and under the brand name ISMO and Monoket. The extended-release forms of the drug are also available generically and under the brand name Imdur.[L11743]Isosorbide mononitrate is an anti-anginal agent and vasodilator that relaxes vascular smooth muscle to prevent and manage angina pectoris. The pharmacological action is mediated by the active metabolite, [nitric oxide], which is released when isosorbide mononitrate is metabolized.[T28] Nitric oxide works on both arteries and veins, but predominantly veins: by relaxing veins and reducing the central venous pressure, nitric oxide causes venous pooling and a decrease in the venous return to the heart, thus decreasing cardiac preload.[L11743] In healthy subjects, the stroke volume is decreased and venous pooling can occur in the standing posture, leading to postural hypotension and dizziness.[T28]     At therapeutic doses of isosorbide mononitrate, nitric oxide has a bigger effect on larger muscular arteries over small resistance arteries. Arterial relaxation leads to reduced systemic vascular resistance and systolic blood (aortic) pressure, decreasing to decreased cardiac afterload.[L11743,T28] The direct dilator effect on coronary arteries opposes the coronary artery spasm in variant angina or angina pectoris.[T28] At larger doses, nitric oxide causes the resistance arteries and arterioles to dilate, reducing arterial pressure via coronary vasodilatation. This leads to increased coronary blood flow.[L11743,T28] Reduced cardiac preload and afterload caused by nitric oxide causes a reduction in myocardial oxygen consumption; decreased myocardial oxygen demand, along with increased coronary blood flow, leads to an increased in the oxygen content of coronary sinus blood [T28] and the relief from ischemia.[L11743]     The end effect of isosorbide mononitrate include decreased cardiac oxygen consumption, redistribution coronary flow toward ischemic areas via collaterals, and the relief of coronary spasms. Nitric oxide can also increase the rate of relaxation of cardiac muscles, which is an effect outside of vascular smooth muscles.[T28] Organic nitrates can also relax other types of smooth muscles, including esophageal and biliary smooth muscle.[T28] The anti-anginal activity of isosorbide mononitrate was observed about 1 hour after dosing, and the peak effect was achieved from 1-4 hours after dosing.[L11698] The duration of anti-anginal action of at least 12 hours was observed with an asymmetrical dosing regimen.[A190738]Isosorbide mononitrate acts as a prodrug for nitric oxide (NO), which is a potent vasodilator gas that is released when the drug is metabolized. NO activates soluble guanylyl cyclase in vascular endothelial cells, which increases the intracellular concentrations of cyclic GMP (cGMP). cGMP activates cGMP-dependent protein kinases, such as protein kinase G and I, which activates the downstream intracellular cascades.[A190732] The downstream cascade results in reduced intracellular concentrations of calcium, caused by processes including inhibition of IP3-mediated pathway, phosphorylation of big calcium-activated potassium channel leading to cell hyperpolarization and reduced calcium influx, and increased calcium efflux via the Ca2+-ATPase-pump.[A190732] Reduced intracellular calcium concentrations lead to the dephosphorylation of myosin light chains and the relaxation of smooth muscle cells.[L11743,T28]"
677,"Used in the treatment of oedema (including that associated with heart failure) and hypertension.A thiazide diuretic with properties similar to those of hydrochlorothiazide. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p830)Trichloromethiazide is indicated as adjunctive therapy in edema associated with congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, and corticosteroid and estrogen therapy. Trichloromethiazide has also been found useful in edema due to various forms of renal dysfunction such as nephrotic syndrome, acute glomer-ulonephritis, and chronic renal failure. Trichloromethiazide is also indicated in the management of hypertension either as the sole therapeutic agent or to enhance the effectiveness of other antihypertensive drugs in the more severe forms of hypertension. Like other thiazides, Trichloromethiazide promotes water loss from the body (diuretics). They inhibit Na+/Cl- reabsorption from the distal convoluted tubules in the kidneys. Thiazides also cause loss of potassium and an increase in serum uric acid. Thiazides are often used to treat hypertension, but their hypotensive effects are not necessarily due to their diuretic activity. Thiazides have been shown to prevent hypertension-related morbidity and mortality although the mechanism is not fully understood. Thiazides cause vasodilation by activating calcium-activated potassium channels (large conductance) in vascular smooth muscles and inhibiting various carbonic anhydrases in vascular tissue.Trichlormethiazide seemingly appears to inhibit the active reabsorption of chloride in the ascending loop of Henle. Additionally, it may also do the same for sodium. These actions subsequently alter electrolyte transfer in the proximal tubule. This results in excretion of sodium, chloride, and water and, hence, diuresis. As a diuretic, Trichloromethiazide inhibits active chloride reabsorption at the early distal tubule via the Na-Cl cotransporter, resulting in an increase in the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water. Thiazides like Trichloromethiazide also inhibit sodium ion transport across the renal tubular epithelium through binding to the thiazide sensitive sodium-chloride transporter. This results in an increase in potassium excretion via the sodium-potassium exchange mechanism. The antihypertensive mechanism of Trichloromethiazide is less well understood although it may be mediated through its action on carbonic anhydrases in the smooth muscle or through its action on the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (KCa) channel, also found in the smooth muscle."

679,"For the treatment of mild to moderate essential hypertension. Felodipine is a long-acting 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB)b. It acts primarily on vascular smooth muscle cells by stabilizing voltage-gated L-type calcium channels in their inactive conformation. By inhibiting the influx of calcium in smooth muscle cells, felodipine prevents calcium-dependent myocyte contraction and vasoconstriction. Felodipine is the most potent CCB in use and is unique in that it exhibits fluorescent activity. In addition to binding to L-type calcium channels, felodipine binds to a number of calcium-binding proteins, exhibits competitive antagonism of the mineralcorticoid receptor, inhibits the activity of calmodulin-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, and blocks calcium influx through voltage-gated T-type calcium channels. Felodipine is used to treat mild to moderate essential hypertension.Felodipine belongs to the dihydropyridine (DHP) class of calcium channel blockers (CCBs), the most widely used class of CCBs. There are at least five different types of calcium channels in Homo sapiens: L-, N-, P/Q-, R- and T-type. It was widely accepted that CCBs target L-type calcium channels, the major channel in muscle cells that mediates contraction; however, some studies have shown that felodipine also binds to and inhibits T-type calcium channels. T-type calcium channels are most commonly found on neurons, cells with pacemaker activity and on osteocytes. The pharmacologic significance of T-type calcium channel blockade is unknown. Felodipine also binds to calmodulin and inhibits calmodulin-dependent calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The effect of this interaction appears to be minor.  Another study demonstrated that felodipine attenuates the activity of calmodulin-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (CaMPDE) by binding to the PDE-1B1 and PDE-1A2 enzyme subunits. CaMPDE is one of the key enzymes involved in cyclic nucleotides and calcium second messenger systems. Felodipine also acts as an antagonist to the mineralcorticoid receptor by competing with aldosterone for binding and blocking aldosterone-induced coactivator recruitment of the mineralcorticoid receptor. Felodipine is able to bind to skeletal and cardiac muscle isoforms of troponin C, one of the key regulatory proteins in muscle contraction. Though felodipine exhibits binding to many endogenous molecules, its vasodilatory effects are still thought to be brought about primarily through inhibition of voltage-gated L-type calcium channels. Similar to other DHP CCBs, felodipine binds directly to inactive calcium channels stabilizing their inactive conformation. Since arterial smooth muscle depolarizations are longer in duration than cardiac muscle depolarizations, inactive channels are more prevalent in smooth muscle cells. Alternative splicing of the alpha-1 subunit of the channel gives felodipine additional arterial selectivity. At therapeutic sub-toxic concentrations, felodipine has little effect on cardiac myocytes and conduction cells.Felodipine decreases arterial smooth muscle contractility and subsequent vasoconstriction by inhibiting the influx of calcium ions through voltage-gated L-type calcium channels. It reversibly competes against nitrendipine and other DHP CCBs for DHP binding sites in vascular smooth muscle and cultured rabbit atrial cells. Calcium ions entering the cell through these channels bind to calmodulin. Calcium-bound calmodulin then binds to and activates myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). Activated MLCK catalyzes the phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain subunit of myosin, a key step in muscle contraction. Signal amplification is achieved by calcium-induced calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through ryanodine receptors. Inhibition of the initial influx of calcium decreases the contractile activity of arterial smooth muscle cells and results in vasodilation. The vasodilatory effects of felodipine result in an overall decrease in blood pressure. Felodipine may be used to treat mild to moderate essential hypertension."

However, it was discovered that ketoconazole produces frequent gastrointestinal side effects and dose-related hepatitis.[A188054,A188057] These effects combined with waning efficacy led to its eventual replacement by triazole agents, [fluconazole], [itraconazole], [voriconazole], and [posaconazole]. Ketoconazole and its predecessor [clotrimazole] continue to be used in topical formulations.Ketoconazole, similarly to other azole antifungals, is a fungistatic agent which causes growth arrest in fungal cells thereby preventing growth and spread of the fungus throughout the body.[T116]Ketoconazole interacts with 14-&alpha;-sterol demethylase, a cytochrome P-450 enzyme necessary for the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol.[A181802,T116] This results in inhibition of ergosterol synthesis and increased fungal cellular permeability due to reduced amounts of ergosterol present in the fungal cell membrane. This metabolic inhibition also results in accumulation of 14α-methyl-3,6-diol, a toxic metabolite. The increase in membrane fluidity is also thought to produce impairment of membrane-bound enzyme systems as components become less closely packed."
681,"For use in the induction and maintenance of general anesthesiaAn inhalation anesthetic. Currently, methoxyflurane is rarely used for surgical, obstetric, or dental anesthesia. If so employed, it should be administered with nitrous oxide to achieve a relatively light level of anesthesia, and a neuromuscular blocking agent given concurrently to obtain the desired degree of muscular relaxation.

It does so by decreasing the extent of gap junction mediated cell-cell coupling and altering the activity of the channels that underlie the action potential.Methoxyflurane induces a reduction in junctional conductance by decreasing gap junction channel opening times and increasing gap junction channel closing times. Methoxyflurane also activates calcium dependent ATPase in the sarcoplasmic reticulum by increasing the fluidity of the lipid membrane. It also appears to bind the D subunit of ATP synthase and NADH dehydogenase. Methoxyflurane also binds to the GABA receptor, the large conductance Ca2+ activated potassium channel, the glutamate receptor and the glycine receptor."

During these processes, DNA topoisomerase I creates reversible single-stranded breaks in double-stranded DNA, allowing intact single DNA strands to pass through the break and relieve the topologic constraints inherent in supercoiled DNA. The 3'-DNA terminus of the broken DNA strand binds covalently with the topoisomerase enzyme to form a catalytic intermediate called a cleavable complex. After DNA is sufficiently relaxed and the strand passage reaction is complete, DNA topoisomerase reattaches the broken DNA strands to form the unaltered topoisomers that allow transcription to proceed. Topotecan interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal cells can be affected by the medicine, other effects may also occur. Unlike irinotecan, topotecan is found predominantly in the inactive carboxylate form at neutral pH and it is not a prodrug.Topotecan has the same mechanism of action as irinotecan and is believed to exert its cytotoxic effects during the S-phase of DNA synthesis. Topoisomerase I relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single strand breaks. Topotecan binds to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevents religation of these single strand breaks. This ternary complex interferes with the moving replication fork, which leads to the induction of replication arrest and lethal double-stranded breaks in DNA. As mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair these double strand breaks, the formation of this ternary complex eventually leads to apoptosis (programmed cell death).    Topotecan mimics a DNA base pair and binds at the site of DNA cleavage by intercalating between the upstream (−1) and downstream (+1) base pairs. Intercalation displaces the downstream DNA, thus preventing religation of the cleaved strand. By specifically binding to the enzyme–substrate complex, Topotecan acts as an uncompetitive inhibitor."
684,"For the reduction of serum uric acid concentrations in chronic gouty arthritis and tophaceous gout in patients with frequent disabling gout attacks. Has also been effectively used to promote uric acid excretion in hyperuricemia secondary to the administration of thiazide and related diuretics. The prototypical uricosuric agent. It inhibits the renal excretion of organic anions and reduces tubular reabsorption of urate. Probenecid has also been used to treat patients with renal impairment, and, because it reduces the renal tubular excretion of other drugs, has been used as an adjunct to antibacterial therapy.Probenecid is a uricosuric and renal tubular blocking agent and is used in combination with colchicine to treat chronic gouty arthritis when complicated by frequent, recurrent acute attacks of gout. It inhibits the reabsorption of urate at the proximal convoluted tubule, thus increasing the urinary excretion of uric acid and decreasing serum urate levels. Effective uricosuria reduces the miscible urate pool, retards urate deposition, and promotes resorption of urate deposits. At the proximal and distal tubles, probenecid competitively inhibits the secretion of many weak organic acids including penicillins, most cephalosporins, and some other β-lactam antibiotics. This results in an increase in the plasma concentrations of acidic drugs eliminated principally by renal secretion, but only a slight increase if the drug is eliminated mainly by filtration. Thus, the drug can be used for therapeutic advantages to increase concentrations of certain β-lactam antibiotics in the treatment of gonorrhea, neurosyphilis, or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).Probenecid inhibits the tubular reabsorption of urate, thus increasing the urinary excretion of uric acid and decreasing serum urate levels. Probenecid may also reduce plasma binding of urate and inhibit renal secretion of uric acid at subtherapeutic concentrations. The mechanism by which probenecid inhibits renal tubular transport is not known, but the drug may inhibit transport enzymes that require a source of high energy phosphate bonds and/or nonspecifically interfere with substrate access to protein receptor sites on the kidney tubules."
685,"For remission induction and maintenance therapy of acute lymphatic leukemia.An antimetabolite antineoplastic agent with immunosuppressant properties. It interferes with nucleic acid synthesis by inhibiting purine metabolism and is used, usually in combination with other drugs, in the treatment of or in remission maintenance programs for leukemia.Mercaptopurine is one of a large series of purine analogues which interfere with nucleic acid biosynthesis and has been found active against human leukemias. It is an analogue of the purine bases adenine and hypoxanthine. It is not known exactly which of any one or more of the biochemical effects of mercaptopurine and its metabolites are directly or predominantly responsible for cell death.Mercaptopurine competes with hypoxanthine and guanine for the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRTase) and is itself converted to thioinosinic acid (TIMP). TIMP inhibits several reactions that involve inosinic acid (IMP), such as the conversion of IMP to xanthylic acid (XMP) and the conversion of IMP to adenylic acid (AMP) via adenylosuccinate (SAMP). Upon methylation, TIMP forms 6-methylthioinosinate (MTIMP) which inhibits glutamine-5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase in addition to TIMP. Glutamine-5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase is the first enzyme unique to the _de novo_ pathway for purine ribonucleotide synthesis. According to experimental findings using radiolabeled mercaptopurine, mercaptopurine may be recovered from the DNA in the form of deoxythioguanosine. In comparison, some mercaptopurine may be converted to nucleotide derivatives of 6-thioguanine (6-TG) via actions of inosinate (IMP) dehydrogenase and xanthylate (XMP) aminase that convert TIMP to thioguanylic acid (TGMP)."
686,"For the treatment of overactive bladder (with symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, or urge incontinence).Tolterodine is an antimuscarinic drug that is used to treat urinary incontinence. Tolterodine acts on M2 and M3 subtypes of muscarinic receptors.Tolterodine is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. Both urinary bladder contraction and salivation are mediated via cholinergic muscarinic receptors. After oral administration, tolterodine is metabolized in the liver, resulting in the formation of the 5-hydroxymethyl derivative, a major pharmacologically active metabolite. The 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite, which exhibits an antimuscarinic activity similar to that of tolterodine, contributes significantly to the therapeutic effect. Both tolterodine and the 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite exhibit a high specificity for muscarinic receptors, since both show negligible activity or affinity for other neurotransmitter receptors and other potential cellular targets, such as calcium channels. Tolterodine has a pronounced effect on bladder function. The main effects of tolterodine are an increase in residual urine, reflecting an incomplete emptying of the bladder, and a decrease in detrusor pressure, consistent with an antimuscarinic action on the lower urinary tract.Both tolterodine and its active metabolite, 5-hydroxymethyltolterodine, act as competitive antagonists at muscarinic receptors. This antagonism results in inhibition of bladder contraction, decrease in detrusor pressure, and an incomplete emptying of the bladder."
687,"Monotherapy for initial treatment of Parkinson's disease, as well as an adjunct therapy in patients with a decreased response to levodopa/carbadopa. Also used for the palliative treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease and at higher doses, for the treatment of depression.A selective, irreversible inhibitor of Type B monoamine oxidase. It is used in newly diagnosed patients with Parkinson's disease. It may slow progression of the clinical disease and delay the requirement for levodopa therapy. It also may be given with levodopa upon onset of disability. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1994, p385) The compound without isomeric designation is Deprenyl.Dopamine is an essential chemical that occurs in many parts of the body. It is the premature degradation of dopamine that results in the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) is an enzyme which accelerates the breakdown of dopamine. Selegiline can prolong the effects of dopamine in the brain by preventing its breakdown through seletively blocking MAO-B. It also may prevent the removal of dopamine between nerve endings and enhance release of dopamine from nerve cells.Although the mechanisms for selegiline's beneficial action in the treatment of Parkinson's disease are not fully understood, the selective, irreversible inhibition of monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) is thought to be of primary importance. MAO-B is involved in the oxidative deamination of dopamine in the brain. Selegiline binds to MAO-B within the nigrostriatal pathways in the central nervous system, thus blocking microsomal metabolism of dopamine and enhancing the dopaminergic activity in the substantial nigra. Selegiline may also increase dopaminergic activity through mechanisms other than inhibition of MAO-B. At higher doses, selegiline can also inhibit monozmine oxidase type A (MAO-A), allowing it to be used for the treatment of depression."

689,"Thalidomide is primarily used for the acute treatment and maintenance therapy to prevent and suppress the cutaneous manifestations of moderate to severe erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL).[L41235]  A piperidinyl isoindole originally introduced as a non-barbiturate hypnotic, thalidomide was withdrawn from the market due to teratogenic effects. It has been reintroduced and used for a number of inflammatory disorders and cancers. Thalidomide displays immunosuppressive and anti-angiogenic activity through modulating the release of inflammatory mediators like tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) and other cytokine action. Due to severe teratogenicity, pregnancy must be excluded before the start of treatment and patients must enrol in the THALIDOMID Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program to ensure contraception adherence.[L41235]Thalidomide, originally developed as a sedative, is an immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory agent with a spectrum of activity that is not fully characterized. However, thalidomide is believed to exert its effect through inhibiting and modulating the level of various inflammatory mediators, particularly tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) and IL-6. [A714] Additionally, thalidomide is also shown to inhibit basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), suggesting a potential anti-angiogenic application of thalidomide in cancer patients. [A246185]    Thalidomide is racemic &mdash; it contains both left and right handed isomers in equal amounts: the (+)R enantiomer is effective against morning sickness, and the (&minus;)S enantiomer is teratogenic. The enantiomers are interconverted to each other in vivo; hence, administering only one enantiomer will not prevent the teratogenic effect in humans [A246190].The mechanism of action of thalidomide is not fully understood. Previous research indicate that thalidomide binds to cerebron, a component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, to selectively degrade the transcription factor IKZF3 and IKZF1. These 2 transcription factors are vital for the proliferation and survival of malignant myeloma cells. [A246125]     Regarding TNF-alpha, thalidomide seems to block this mediator via a variety of mechanism. Thalidomide can inhibit the expression myeloid differentiating factor 88 (MyD88), an adaptor protein that is involved in the TNF-alpha production signalling pathway, at the protein and RNA level. Additionally, thalidomide prevents the activation of Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NF-kB), another upstream effector of the TNF-alpha production pathway. Finally, some evidences suggest that thalidomide can block alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AGP), a known inducer of the NF-kB/MyD88 pathway, thus inhibiting the expression of TNF-alpha [A246195]. The down-regulation of NF-kB and MyD88 can also affect the cross talk between the NF-kB/MyD88 and VEGF pathway, resulting in thalidomide's anti-angiogenic effect. [A246200]"
690,"Melphalan is indicated for use as a high-dose conditioning treatment prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with multiple myeloma.[L47890] It is also indicated for the palliative treatment of multiple myeloma and for the palliation of non-resectable epithelial carcinoma of the ovary.[L40928]    Melphalan is a component of HEPZATO KIT, a liver-directed therapy indicated for the treatment of adults with uveal melanoma with unresectable hepatic metastases affecting less than 50% of the liver and no extrahepatic disease or extrahepatic disease limited to the bone, lymph nodes, subcutaneous tissues, or lung that is amenable to resection or radiation.[L47895]Melphalan is a nitrogen mustard or bischloroethylamine type alkylating agent.[L40928] It was first synthesized in the early 1950s by substituting L-phenylalanine for the methyl group on nitrogen mustard.[A261150, A261155] Melphalan is used in the treatment of multiple myeloma and ovarian carcinoma.[L40928] It is also used for high-conditioning before hematopoietic stem cell transplant.[L47890] It is also used to treat uveal melanoma with unresectable hepatic metastases.[L47895]Melphalan possesses cytotoxic, immunosuppressive, and myeloablative activities.[A261150, L40928] Melphalan produces chromosomal aberrations in vitro and in vivo; thus, it is considered to be potentially leukemogenic in humans.

691,"Memantine is used to manage moderate to severe Alzheimer's dementia [FDA label].     A more recent systemic review and meta-analysis [A177106] indicates that memantine is beneficial as a first line drug for the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia.  Cholinesterase inhibitors may be added to memantine for further beneficial effects on behavioral symptoms and other symptoms of dementia [A177106].Initially approved by the FDA in 2013, memantine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist used in the management of Alzheimer's Disease (AD).  It is different from many other Alzheimer's Disease medications, as it works by a different mechanism than the cholinesterase enzyme inhibitors normally employed in the management of Alzheimer's disease [A1639].  Memantine blocks the effects of glutamate, a neurotransmitter in the brain that leads to neuronal excitability and excessive stimulation in Alzheimer's Disease [T556].    In 2010, it was estimated that 36 million people worldwide live with Alzheimer's Disease. In 2013, this number increased to 44 million.  Almost doubling every 20 years, the prevalence of Alzheimer's Disease is predicted to reach 66 million by 2030 and to 115 million by 2050 [F4366]. In December 2013, the G8 dementia summit concluded that dementia should be considered a global priority with the objective of developing a cure or a disease-modifying therapy by the year 2025 [L5953, F4366].**General effects**    This drug inhibits calcium influx into cells that is normally caused by chronic NMDA receptor activation by glutamate [A1640]. This leads to the improvement of Alzheimer's dementia symptoms, demonstrated by increased cognition and other beneficial central nervous system effects [A1640].     **Effects on neuroplasticity**    Like other NMDA receptor antagonists, memantine at high doses can reduce neuronal synaptic plasticity that is involved in learning and memory processes. At lower concentrations, which are normally used in the clinical setting, memantine can enhance neuronal synaptic plasticity in the brain, improve memory, and act as a neuroprotectant against the destruction of neurons caused by excitatory neurotransmitters [A1639].     **Effect on various receptors**    Memantine has demonstrated minimal activity for GABA, benzodiazepine, dopamine, adrenergic, histamine, and glycine receptors, as well as voltage-dependent Ca2+, Na+ or K+ channels. This drug has shown antagonist activity at the 5HT3 receptors. Laboratory studies suggest that memantine does not affect the reversible inhibition of the acetylcholinesterase normally caused by donepezil, galantamine, or tacrine [FDA label].Continuous activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the central nervous system caused by _glutamate_ is thought to cause some of the Alzheimer's disease symptoms. This overactivation is thought to contribute to neurotoxicity due to the excitatory properties of glutamate [T556]. The pharmacological effect of memantine likely occurs via the drug's behavior as an uncompetitive (open-channel) NMDA receptor antagonist, preventing glutamate action on this receptor.  Memantine has a preference for the NMDA receptor-operated cation channels. Despite these antagonist effects, memantine has not been proven to prevent or retard the neurodegeneration seen in patients diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease [FDA label]."
692,"For the treatment of bronchitis, sinusitis, community-acquired pneumonia, and skin infections (abscesses, wounds) caused by S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus, M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, L. pneumophila, S. pyogenesGatifloxacin is an antibiotic agent and a member of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolone family. It works by inhibiting the bacterial enzymes DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. It was first introduced by Bristol-Myers Squibb in 1999 under the brand name Tequin® for the treatment of respiratory tract infections. Gatifloxacin is available as tablets and in various aqueous solutions for intravenous therapy. It is also available as eye drops under the brand name Zymar® marketed by Allergan.    The FDA withdrew its approval for the use of non-ophthalmic drug products containing gatifloxacin due to the high prevalence of gatifloxacin-associated dysglycemia adverse event reports and the high incidence of hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic episodes in patients taking gatifloxacin compared to those on macrolide antibiotics.[L43942,L44037]Gatifloxacin is a synthetic broad-spectrum 8-methoxyfluoroquinolone antibacterial agent for oral or intravenous administration. is bactericidal and its mode of action depends on blocking of bacterial DNA replication by binding itself to an enzyme called DNA gyrase, which allows the untwisting required to replicate one DNA double helix into two. Notably the drug has 100 times higher affinity for bacterial DNA gyrase than for mammalian. Gatifloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria.The bactericidal action of Gatifloxacin results from inhibition of the enzymes topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV, which are required for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination."
693,"Rifampin is indicated for the treatment of tuberculosis and tuberculosis-related mycobacterial infections.[L45369]A semisynthetic antibiotic produced from Streptomyces mediterranei. It has a broad antibacterial spectrum, including activity against several forms of Mycobacterium. In susceptible organisms it inhibits DNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity by forming a stable complex with the enzyme. It thus suppresses the initiation of RNA synthesis. Rifampin is bactericidal, and acts on both intracellular and extracellular organisms. (From Gilman et al., Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 9th ed, p1160)Rifampin is an antibiotic that inhibits DNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity in susceptible cells. Specifically, it interacts with bacterial RNA polymerase but does not inhibit the mammalian enzyme. It is bactericidal and has a very broad spectrum of activity against most gram-positive and gram-negative organisms (including Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and specifically Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Because of rapid emergence of resistant bacteria, use is restricted to treatment of mycobacterial infections and a few other indications. Rifampin is well absorbed when taken orally and is distributed widely in body tissues and fluids, including the CSF. It is metabolized in the liver and eliminated in bile and, to a much lesser extent, in urine, but dose adjustments are unnecessary with renal insufficiency.Rifampin acts via the inhibition of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, leading to a suppression of RNA synthesis and cell death."
694,"Lubiprostone is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic idiopathic constipation, or opioid-induced constipation in patients with chronic non-cancer pain.[L4421] It is also indicated for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) in female patients ≥18 years old.[L4421]Lubiprostone is a medication used in the management of idiopathic chronic constipation. A prostaglandin E1 derivative, lubiprostone is a bicyclic fatty acid that activates ClC-2 chloride channels located on the apical side of the gastrointestinal epithelial cells. Activation of these channels promotes the secretion of a chloride-rich fluid that soften the stool, increase gastrointestinal motility, and induce spontaneous bowel movements (SBM).Chronic idiopathic constipation is generally defined by infrequent or difficult passage of stool. The signs and symptoms associated with chronic idiopathic constipation (i.e., abdominal pain or discomfort, bloating, straining, and hard or lumpy stools) may be the result of abnormal colonic motility that can delay the transit of intestinal contents and impede the evacuation of rectal contents. One approach to the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation is the secretion of fluid into the abdominal lumen through the activation of chloride channels in the apical membrane of the gastrointestinal epithelium. Lubiprostone is a locally acting chloride channel activator that increases intestinal chloride and fluid secretion without altering sodium and potassium concentrations in the serum.Lubiprostone acts by specifically activating ClC-2 chloride channels, which is a normal constituent of the apical membrane of the human intestine, in a protein kinase A action independent fashion. Activation of ClC-2 chloride channels causes an efflux of chloride ions into the lumen, which in turn leads to an efflux of sodium ions through a paracellular pathway to maintain isoelectric neutrality. As a result, water follows sodium into the lumen in order to maintain isotonic equilibrium, thereby increasing intestinal fluid secretion. By increasing intestinal fluid secretion, lubiprostone increases motility in the intestine, thereby increasing the passage of stool and alleviating symptoms associated with chronic idiopathic constipation. Activation of ClC-2 chloride channels may also stimulate the recovery of muscosal barrier function by restoring tight junction protein complexes in the intestine. Patch clamp cell studies in human cell lines have indicated that the majority of the beneficial biological activity of lubiprostone and its metabolites is observed only on the apical (luminal) portion of the gastrointestinal epithelium."
695,"A topical anti-inflammatory product for the relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses.A topical glucocorticoid used in the treatment of eczema.Fluocinonide is a potent glucocorticoid steroid used topically as anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment of skin disorders such as eczema. It mediates its effects to relieve itching, redness, dryness, crusting, scaling, inflammation, and discomfort associated with inflammatory skin conditions. Fluocinonide is a potent glucocorticoid steroid used topically as anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment of skin disorders such as eczema. Fluocinonide binds to the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor. After binding the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific target genes. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Specifically glucocorticoids induce lipocortin-1 (annexin-1) synthesis, which then binds to cell membranes preventing the phospholipase A2 from coming into contact with its substrate arachidonic acid. This leads to diminished eicosanoid production. Cyclooxygenase (both COX-1 and COX-2) expression is also suppressed, potentiating the effect. In another words, the two main products in inflammation Prostaglandins and Leukotrienes are inhibited by the action of Glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids also stimulate the lipocortin-1 escaping to the extracellular space, where it binds to the leukocyte membrane receptors and inhibits various inflammatory events: epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, respiratory burst and the release of various inflammatory mediators (lysosomal enzymes, cytokines, tissue plasminogen activator, chemokines etc.) from neutrophils, macrophages and mastocytes. Additionally the immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference with antigen-antibody binding.  Like other glucocorticoid agents Fluocinolone acetonide acts as a physiological antagonist to insulin by decreasing glycogenesis (formation of glycogen). It also promotes the breakdown of lipids (lipolysis), and proteins, leading to the mobilization of extrahepatic amino acids and ketone bodies. This leads to increased circulating glucose concentrations (in the blood). There is also decreased glycogen formation in the liver."
696,"Chemically, it is a synthetic carbocyclic nucleoside and is the enantiomer with 1S, 4R absolute configuration on the cyclopentene ring. In vivo, abacavir sulfate dissociates to its free base, abacavir.Abacavir is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) with activity against Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1). Abacavir is phosphorylated to active metabolites that compete for incorporation into viral DNA. They inhibit the HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme competitively and act as a chain terminator of DNA synthesis. The concentration of drug necessary to effect viral replication by 50 percent (EC50) ranged from 3.7 to 5.8 μM (1 μM = 0.28 mcg/mL) and 0.07 to 1.0 μM against HIV-1IIIB and HIV-1BaL, respectively, and was 0.26 ± 0.18 μM against 8 clinical isolates.  Abacavir had synergistic activity in cell culture in combination with the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) zidovudine, the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) nevirapine, and the protease inhibitor (PI) amprenavir; and additive activity in combination with the NRTIs didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir, and zalcitabine. Abacavir is a carbocyclic synthetic nucleoside analogue and an antiviral agent. Intracellularly, abacavir is converted by cellular enzymes to the active metabolite carbovir triphosphate, an analogue of deoxyguanosine-5'-triphosphate (dGTP). Carbovir triphosphate inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) both by competing with the natural substrate dGTP and by its incorporation into viral DNA. Viral DNA growth is terminated because the incorporated nucleotide lacks a 3'-OH group, which is needed to form the 5′ to 3′ phosphodiester linkage essential for DNA chain elongation. "

The prostaglandin inhibition of ibuprofen has been studied for the treatment of this condition as it is known that prostaglandin E2 is responsible for keeping the ductus arteriosus open.[A39100]    * Rheumatoid- and osteo-arthritis - ibuprofen is very commonly used in the symptomatic treatment of inflammatory, musculoskeletal and rheumatic disorders.[A39176]    * Cystic fibrosis - the use of high dosages of ibuprofen has been proven to decrease inflammation and decreasing polymorphonuclear cell influx in the lungs.[A39177]    * Orthostatic hypotension - ibuprofen can induce sodium retention and antagonize the effect of diuretics which has been reported to be beneficial for patients with severe orthostatic hypotension.[A1651]    * Dental pain - ibuprofen is used to manage acute and chronic orofacial pain.[A10901]    * Pain - ibuprofen is widely used to reduce minor aches and pains as well as to reduce fever and manage dysmenorrhea. It is very commonly used for the relief of acute indications such as fever and tension headaches.[A39092] It is also used to manage mild to moderate pain and moderate to severe pain as an adjunct to opioid analgesics.[L40208]    * Investigational uses - efforts have been put into developing ibuprofen for the prophylaxis of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson disease, and breast cancer.[A39092]Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) derived from propionic acid and it is considered the first of the propionics.[A39074] The formula of ibuprofen is 2-(4-isobutylphenyl) propionic acid and its initial development was in 1960 while researching for a safer alternative for aspirin.[A39075] Ibuprofen was finally patented in 1961 and this drug was first launched against rheumatoid arthritis in the UK in 1969 and USA in 1974. It was the first available over-the-counter NSAID.[A39076]    On the available products, ibuprofen is administered as a racemic mixture. Once administered, the R-enantiomer undergoes extensive interconversion to the S-enantiomer _in vivo_ by the activity of the alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase. In particular, it is generally proposed that the S-enantiomer is capable of eliciting stronger pharmacological activity than the R-enantiomer.[A39194]Ibuprofen has multiple actions in different inflammatory pathways involved in acute and chronic inflammation. The main effects reported in ibuprofen are related to the control of pain, fever and acute inflammation by the inhibition of the synthesis of prostanoids by COX-1 and COX-2. Pain relief is attributed to peripheral affected regions and central nervous system effects in the pain transmission mediated by the dorsal horn and higher spinothalamic tract. Some reports have tried to link the pain regulation with a possible enhancement on the synthesis of endogenous cannabinoids and action on the NMDA receptors. The effect on pain has been shown to be related to the cortically evoked potentials.[A39190]    The antipyretic effect is reported to be linked to the effect on the prostanoid synthesis due to the fact that the prostanoids are the main signaling mediator of pyresis in the hypothalamic-preoptic region.[A39190]    The use of ibuprofen in dental procedures is attributed to the local inhibition of prostanoid production as well as to anti-oedemic activity and an increase of plasma beta-endorphins. Some reports have suggested a rapid local reduction of the expression of COX-2 in dental pulp derived by the administration of ibuprofen.[A39190]    The administration of ibuprofen in patients with rheumatic diseases has shown to control joint symptoms.[A39092]     Ibuprofen is largely used in OTC products such as an agent for the management of dysmenorrhea which has been proven to reduce the amount of menstrual prostanoids and to produce a reduction in the uterine hypercontractility.[A39181] As well, it has been reported to reduce significantly the fever and the pain caused by migraines.[A39182, A39183] This effect is thought to be related to the effect on platelet activation and thromboxane A2 production which produces local vascular effects in the affected regions. This effect is viable as ibuprofen can enter in the central nervous system.[A39190]    In the investigational uses of ibuprofen, it has been reported to reduce neurodegeneration when given in low doses over a long time.[A39184] On the other hand, its use in Parkinson disease is related to the importance of inflammation and oxidative stress in the pathology of this condition.[A39185] The use of ibuprofen for breast cancer is related to a study that shows a decrease of 50% in the rate of breast cancer.[A39186]The exact mechanism of action of ibuprofen is unknown. However, ibuprofen is considered an NSAID and thus it is a non-selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, which is an enzyme involved in prostaglandin (mediators of pain and fever) and thromboxane (stimulators of blood clotting) synthesis via the arachidonic acid pathway.[L4614]    Ibuprofen is a non-selective COX inhibitor and hence, it inhibits the activity of both COX-1 and COX-2. The inhibition of COX-2 activity decreases the synthesis of prostaglandins involved in mediating inflammation, pain, fever, and swelling while the inhibition of COX-1 is thought to cause some of the side effects of ibuprofen including GI ulceration.[A39195]"
699,"For use in the treatment of severe infections caused by penicillin G-susceptible microorganisms when rapid and high penicillin levels are required such as in the treatment of septicemia, meningitis, pericarditis, endocarditis and severe pneumonia.Benzylpenicillin (Penicillin G) is narrow spectrum antibiotic used to treat infections caused by susceptible bacteria. It is a natural penicillin antibiotic that is administered intravenously or intramuscularly due to poor oral absorption. Penicillin G may also be used in some cases as prophylaxis against susceptible organisms.     Natural penicillins are considered the drugs of choice for several infections caused by susceptible gram positive aerobic organisms, such as *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, groups A, B, C and G streptococci, nonenterococcal group D streptococci, viridans group streptococci, and non-penicillinase producing staphylococcus. Aminoglycosides may be added for synergy against group B streptococcus (*S. agalactiae*), *S. viridans*, and *Enterococcus faecalis*. The natural penicillins may also be used as first or second line agents against susceptible gram positive aerobic bacilli such as *Bacillus anthracis*, *Corynebacterium diphtheriae*, and *Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae*. Natural penicillins have limited activity against gram negative organisms; however, they may be used in some cases to treat infections caused by *Neisseria meningitidis* and *Pasteurella*. They are not generally used to treat anaerobic infections. Resistance patterns, susceptibility and treatment guidelines vary across regions.Penicillin G is a penicillin beta-lactam antibiotic used in the treatment of bacterial infections caused by susceptible, usually gram-positive, organisms. The name ""penicillin"" can either refer to several variants of penicillin available, or to the group of antibiotics derived from the penicillins. Penicillin G has <i>in vitro</i> activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The bactericidal activity of penicillin G results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis and is mediated through penicillin G binding to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). Penicillin G is stable against hydrolysis by a variety of beta-lactamases, including penicillinases, and cephalosporinases and extended spectrum beta-lactamases.By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, penicillin G inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that penicillin G interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."
700,"For the treatment of mild to moderate hypertensionNitrendipine is a calcium channel blocker with marked vasodilator action. It is an effective antihypertensive agent and differs from other calcium channel blockers in that it does not reduce glomerular filtration rate and is mildly natriuretic, rather than sodium retentive.Nitrendipine, a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker, is used alone or with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, to treat hypertension, chronic stable angina pectoris, and Prinzmetal's variant angina. Nitrendipine is similar to other peripheral vasodilators. Nitrendipine inhibits the influx of extra cellular calcium across the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes possibly by deforming the channel, inhibiting ion-control gating mechanisms, and/or interfering with the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The decrease in intracellular calcium inhibits the contractile processes of the myocardial smooth muscle cells, causing dilation of the coronary and systemic arteries, increased oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue, decreased total peripheral resistance, decreased systemic blood pressure, and decreased afterload.By deforming the channel, inhibiting ion-control gating mechanisms, and/or interfering with the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, Nitrendipine inhibits the influx of extracellular calcium across the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes The decrease in intracellular calcium inhibits the contractile processes of the myocardial smooth muscle cells, causing dilation of the coronary and systemic arteries, increased oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue, decreased total peripheral resistance, decreased systemic blood pressure, and decreased afterload."
701,"For the treatment of documented ventricular arrhythmias, such as sustained ventricular tachycardia, that, in the judgment of the physician, are life-threatening.An antiarrhythmic agent which exerts a potential- and frequency-dependent block of sodium channels.Tocainide is a primary amine analog of lidocaine with antiarrhythmic properties useful in the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias. Tocainide, like lidocaine, produces dose dependent decreases in sodium and potassium conductance, thereby decreasing the excitability of myocardial cells. In experimental animal models, the dose-related depression of sodium current is more pronounced in ischemic tissue than in normal tissue. Tocainide is a Class I antiarrhythmic compound with electrophysiologic properties in man similar to those of lidocaine, but dissimilar from quinidine, procainamide, and disopyramide.Tocainide acts on sodium channels on the neuronal cell membrane, limiting the spread of seizure activity and reducing seizure propagation. Tocainide binds preferentially to the inactive state of the sodium channels.The antiarrhythmic actions are mediated through effects on sodium channels in Purkinje fibers."
702,"For use in the treatment of subacute or chronic angle-closure glaucoma after iridectomy or where surgery is refused or contraindicated.A potent, long-acting irreversible cholinesterase inhibitor used as an ocular hypertensive in the treatment of glaucoma. Occasionally used for accomodative esotropia.Echothiophate Iodide is a potent, long-acting cholinesterase inhibitor used as a miotic in the treatment of glaucoma. Echothiophate iodide will depress both plasma and erythrocyte cholinesterase levels in most patients after a few weeks of eyedrop therapy.Echothiophate Iodide is a long-acting cholinesterase inhibitor for topical use which enhances the effect of endogenously liberated acetylcholine in iris, ciliary muscle, and other parasympathetically innervated structures of the eye. Echothiophate iodide binds irreversibly to cholinesterase, and is long acting due to the slow rate of hydrolysis by cholinesterase. It causes miosis, increase in facility of outflow of aqueous humor, fall in intraocular pressure, and potentiation of accommodation. "
703,"Praziquantel is indicated in patients aged 1 year and older for the treatment of the schistosomiasis due to all species of Schistosoma (for example, Schistosoma mekongi, Schistosoma japonicum, Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma hematobium) and clonorchiasis and opisthorchiasis due to the liver flukes, Clonorchis sinensis/Opisthorchis viverrini (approval of this indication was based on studies in which the two species were not differentiated).[L50021]Praziquantel is a pyrazino-isoquinolein derivative from the thioxantonic group used as a broad anthelmintic spectrum. Specifically, it is known as a treatment of trematodes and cestodes infections such as schistosomiasis, taeniasis, and cysticercosis.[A263201] The efficacy of praziquantel in treating parasitic flatworms infection with low cost (~US$0.20 drug cost to treat a child) makes it an integral to WHO's plan to eliminate schistosomiasis by 2030.[A263206,A263211] Despite being approved since 1980, the exact mechanism of action is yet to be elucidated.[A263211]In vitro studies on trematodes and cestodes have shown that praziquantel induces a rapid contraction of schistosomas by a specific effect on the permeability of the cell membrane. The drug further causes vacuolization and disintegration of the schistosome tegument. The effect is more marked on adult worms compared to young worms. An increased Ca2+-influx may play an important role.[L40268]    Secondary effects are inhibition of glucose uptake, lowering of glycogen levels and stimulation of lactate release. The action of praziquantel is specific to trematodes and cestodes; nematodes (including filariae) are not affected.[L40268]    Praziquantel is active against schistosoma (for example, Schistosoma mekongi, Schistosoma japonicum, Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma hematobium), and infections due to the liver flukes, Clonorchis sinensis/Opisthorchis viverrini. Published in vitro data have shown a potential lack of efficacy of praziquantel against migrating schistosomulae.[L50021]    An interesting quirk of praziquantel is that it is relatively ineffective against juvenile schistosomes. While initially effective, effectiveness against schistosomes decreases until it reaches a minimum at 3-4 weeks. Effectiveness then increases again until it is once again fully effective at 6-7 weeks.[A1664]Although the exact mechanism of action is unknown, praziquantel was hypothesized to target the β subunits of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, particularly in Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma japonicum, due to the lack of two conserved serine residues in these subunits. This is supported by the finding that co-administration of calcium channel blockers like nicarpidine and nifedipine renders 50% of Schistosoma mansoni resistant to praziquantel.[L50021,A1664]    Increased exposure of antigens on the worm surface was also observed, but little research has been done to elucidate on the mechanism of action.[A1664]"
704,"For the treatment of urinary tract infectionA synthetic fluoroquinolone (fluoroquinolones) with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against most gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. Norfloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase.Norfloxacin is a quinolone/fluoroquinolone antibiotic. Norfloxacin is bactericidal and its mode of action depends on blocking of bacterial DNA replication by binding itself to an enzyme called DNA gyrase, which allows the untwisting required to replicate one DNA double helix into two. Notably the drug has 100 times higher affinity for bacterial DNA gyrase than for mammalian.The bactericidal action of Norfloxacin results from inhibition of the enzymes topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV, which are required for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination. Norfloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic agent that is shown to be effective against various Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial species. The fluorine atom at the 6 position increases potency against gram-negative organisms, and the piperazine moiety at the 7 position is responsible for anti-pseudomonal activity"

707,"Oxybutynin is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of overactive bladder, which causes urge urinary incontinence and frequency, and urgency.  Oxybutynin may also be used for children aged 6 and above for the symptomatic management of detrusor muscle overactivity which has been found to be related to a neurological condition. Spina bifida is an example of a neurological condition in which oxybutynin may be used to control urinary symptoms.[L8648] On occasion, oxybutynin may be used off-label to relieve bladder spasms associated with ureteral stents or urinary catheters.[T689]Overactive bladder (OAB) is a common condition negatively impacting the lives of millions of patients worldwide.  Due to its urinary symptoms that include nocturia, urgency, and frequency, this condition causes social embarrassment and a poor quality of life.[A185996,A185999]     Oxybutynin, also marketed as Ditropan XL, is an anticholinergic medication used for the relief of overactive bladder symptoms that has been optimized for high levels of safety and efficacy since initial FDA approval in 1975.[A183782,L8648] This drug relieves undesirable urinary symptoms, increasing the quality of life for patients affected by OAB.  It is often used as first-line therapy for OAB.[A185990]Oxybutynin exerts antispasmodic actions on the bladder, relieving the uncomfortable symptoms of overactive bladder, including urinary urgency and frequency. These actions occur through the inhibition of muscarinic receptors.    **A note on angioedema and anticholinergic effects**    Symptoms of angioedema may occur with oxybutynin therapy. If angioedema is suspected, discontinue oxybutynin immediately and provide appropriate medical treatment.[L8648] In addition, anticholinergic effects may occur with the administration of this drug. Some symptoms may include hallucinations, confusion, agitation, and drowsiness. It is advisable to avoid operating heavy machinery before the response to oxybutynin has been monitored. Dose adjustments may be required.[L8648]Oxybutynin acts to relax the bladder by inhibiting the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle, and not skeletal muscle.[L8648]  The active of oxybutynin is metabolite is N-desethyloxybutynin. It competitively inhibits the postganglionic type 1, 2 and 3 muscarinic receptors. The above actions lead to increased urine capacity in the bladder, decreasing urinary urgency and frequency.  In addition, oxybutynin delays the initial desire to void.[T689,L8648]"
708,"Used orally for jet lag, insomnia, shift-work disorder, circadian rhythm disorders in the blind (evidence for efficacy), and benzodiazepine and nicotine withdrawal. Evidence indicates that melatonin is likely effective for treating circadian rhythm sleep disorders in blind children and adults. It has received FDA orphan drug status as an oral medication for this use. A number of studies have shown that melatonin may be effective for treating sleep-wake cycle disturbances in children and adolescents with mental retardation, autism, and other central nervous system disorders. It appears to decrease the time to fall asleep in children with developmental disabilities, such as cerebral palsy, autism, and mental retardation. It may also improve secondary insomnia associated with various sleep-wake cycle disturbances. Other possible uses for which there is some evidence for include: benzodiazepine withdrawal, cluster headache, delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS), primary insomnia, jet lag, nicotine withdrawal, preoperative anxiety and sedation, prostate cancer, solid tumors (when combined with IL-2 therapy in certain cancers), sunburn prevention (topical use), tardive dyskinesia, thrombocytopenia associated with cancer, chemotherapy and other disorders. Melatonin is a biogenic amine that is found in animals, plants and microbes. Aaron B. Lerner of Yale University is credited for naming the hormone and for defining its chemical structure in 1958.  In mammals, melatonin is produced by the pineal gland. The pineal gland is small endocrine gland, about the size of a rice grain and shaped like a pine cone (hence the name), that is located in the center of the brain (rostro-dorsal to the superior colliculus) but outside the blood-brain barrier. The secretion of melatonin increases in darkness and decreases during exposure to light, thereby regulating the circadian rhythms of several biological functions, including the sleep-wake cycle. In particular, melatonin regulates the sleep-wake cycle by chemically causing drowsiness and lowering the body temperature.  Melatonin is also implicated in the regulation of mood, learning and memory, immune activity, dreaming, fertility and reproduction. Melatonin is also an effective antioxidant.  Most of the actions of melatonin are mediated through the binding and activation of melatonin receptors. Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) may have lower than normal levels of melatonin. A 2008 study found that unaffected parents of individuals with ASD also have lower melatonin levels, and that the deficits were associated with low activity of the ASMT gene, which encodes the last enzyme of melatonin synthesis. Reduced melatonin production has also been proposed as a likely factor in the significantly higher cancer rates in night workers.Melatonin is a hormone normally produced in the pineal gland and released into the blood. The essential amino acid L-tryptophan is a precursor in the synthesis of melatonin. It helps regulate sleep-wake cycles or the circadian rhythm. Production of melatonin is stimulated by darkness and inhibited by light. High levels of melatonin induce sleep and so consumption of the drug can be used to combat insomnia and jet lag.  MT1 and MT2 receptors may be a target for the treatment of circadian and non circadian sleep disorders because of their differences in pharmacology and function within the SCN. SCN is responsible for maintaining the 24 hour cycle which regulates many different body functions ranging from sleep to immune functions  Melatonin is a derivative of tryptophan. It binds to melatonin receptor type 1A, which then acts on adenylate cylcase and the inhibition of a cAMP signal transduction pathway. Melatonin not only inhibits adenylate cyclase, but it also activates phosphilpase C. This potentiates the release of arachidonate. By binding to melatonin receptors 1 and 2, the downstream signallling cascades have various effects in the body. The melatonin receptors are G protein-coupled receptors and are expressed in various tissues of the body. There are two subtypes of the receptor in humans, melatonin receptor 1 (MT1) and melatonin receptor 2 (MT2). Melatonin and melatonin receptor agonists, on market or in clinical trials, all bind to and activate both receptor types.The binding of the agonists to the receptors has been investigated for over two decades or since 1986. It is somewhat known, but still not fully understood. When melatonin receptor agonists bind to and activate their receptors it causes numerous physiological processes.  MT1 receptors are expressed in many regions of the central nervous system (CNS): suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (SNC), hippocampus, substantia nigra, cerebellum, central dopaminergic pathways, ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens. MT1 is also expressed in the retina, ovary, testis, mammary gland, coronary circulation and aorta, gallbladder, liver, kidney, skin and the immune system. MT2 receptors are expressed mainly in the CNS, also in the lung, cardiac, coronary and aortic tissue, myometrium and granulosa cells, immune cells, duodenum and adipocytes.  The binding of melatonin to melatonin receptors activates a few signaling pathways. MT1 receptor activation inhibits the adenylyl cyclase and its inhibition causes a rippling effect of non activation; starting with decreasing formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and then progressing to less protein kinase A (PKA) activity, which in turn hinders the phosphorilation of cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB binding protein) into P-CREB. MT1 receptors also activate phospholipase C (PLC), affect ion channels and regulate ion flux inside the cell. The binding of melatonin to MT2 receptors inhibits adenylyl cyclase which decreases the formation of cAMP.[4] As well it hinders guanylyl cyclase and therefore the forming of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Binding to MT2 receptors probably affects PLC which increases protein kinase C (PKC) activity. Activation of the receptor can lead to ion flux inside the cell."
709,"For the treatment of mild to moderate infections in adults and adolescents (12 years of age or older) which are caused by susceptible strains of microorganisms in acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, and uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections.

710,"Indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.[label] Glipizide is an oral hypoglycemic agent in the second-generation sulfonylurea drug class that is used to control blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It was first introduced in 1984 [A179491] and is available in various countries including Canada and the U.S. According to the 2018 Clinical Practice Guidelines by Diabetes Canada, sulfonylurea drugs are considered a second-line glucose-lowering therapy following metformin.[L6712] Because sulfonylureas require functional pancreatic beta cells for their therapeutic effectiveness, sulfonylureas are more commonly used for early-stage type 2 diabetes when there is no progressed pancreatic failure.[T28] Compared to the first-generation sulfonylureas, such as [tolbutamide] and [chlorpropamide], second-generation sulfonylureas contain a more non-polar side chain in their chemical structure, which enhances their hypoglycemic potency.[A179488] Compared to other members of the sulfonylurea drug group, glipizide displays rapid absorption and onset of action with the shortest half-life and duration of action, reducing the risk for long-lasting hypoglycemia that is often observed with blood glucose-lowering agents.[A179485] Glipizide was first approved by the FDA in 1994 and is available in extended-release tablets under the brand name Glucotrol®, as well as in combination with metformin under the brand name Metaglip®.Glipizide is a blood glucose-lowering agent. The initial onset of blood glucose-lowering effect occurs around 30 minutes post-administration with the duration of action lasting for about 12 to 24 hours.[L6739] While the chronic use of glipizide does not result in elevations in the fasting insulin levels over time, the postprandial insulin response, or insulin response to a meal, is observed to be enhanced, even after 6 months of treatment.[label] The main therapeutic actions of glipizide primarily occur at the pancreas where the insulin release is stimulated, but glipizide also mediates some extrapancreatic effects, such as the promotion of insulin signaling effects on the muscles, fat, or liver cells.[L6745] Due to its action on the endogenous cells, sulfonylureas including glipizide is associated with a risk for developing hypoglycemia and weight gain in patients receiving the drug.[A179554,T28] Chronic administration of glipizide may result in down-regulation of the sulfonylurea receptors on pancreatic beta cells, which are molecular targets of the drug, leading to a reduced effect on insulin secretion.[A177715]     Like other sulfonylureas, glipizide may work on pancreatic delta (δ) cells and alpha (α) cells to stimulate the secretion of somatostatin and suppress the secretion of glucagon, which are peptide hormones that regulate neuroendocrine and metabolic pathways. Other than its primary action on the pancreas, glipizide also exerts other biological actions outside of the pancreas, or ""extrapancreatic effects"", which is similar to other members of the sulfonylurea drug class. Glipizide may enhance the glucose uptake into the skeletal muscles and potentiate the action of insulin in the liver. Other effects include inhibited lipolysis in the liver and adipose tissue, inhibited hepatic glucose output, and increased uptake and oxidation of glucose. It has also been demonstrated by several studies that the chronic therapeutic use of sulfonylureas may result in an increase in insulin receptors expressed on monocytes, adipocytes, and erythrocytes.[A177715]Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder with increasing prevalence worldwide. Characterized by higher-than-normal levels of blood glucose, T2DM is a complex disorder that arises from the interaction between genetic, environmental and behavioral risk factors. Insulin is a peptide hormone that plays a critical role in regulating blood glucose levels. In response to high blood glucose levels, insulin promotes the uptake of glucose into the liver, muscle cells, and fat cells for storage. Although there are multiple events occurring that lead to the pathophysiology of T2DM, the disorder mainly involves insulin insensitivity as a result of insulin resistance, declining insulin production, and eventual failure of beta cells of pancreatic islets that normally produce insulin.[A179554] Early management with lifestyle intervention, such as controlled diet and exercise, is critical in reducing the risk of long-term secondary complications, such as cardiovascular mortality.    Glipizide, like other sulfonylurea drugs, is an insulin secretagogue, which works by stimulating the insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells thereby increasing the plasma concentrations of insulin.[A177715] Thus, the main therapeutic action of the drug depends on the functional beta cells in the pancreatic islets.[L6739] Sulfonylureas bind to the sulfonylurea receptor expressed on the pancreatic beta-cell plasma membrane, leading to the closure of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel and reduced potassium conductance. This results in depolarization of the pancreatic beta cell and opening of the voltage-sensitive calcium channels, promoting calcium ion influx. Increased intracellular concentrations of calcium ions in beta cells stimulates the secretion, or exocytosis, of insulin granules from the cells.[label,T28] Apart from this main mechanism of action, the blood-glucose-lowering effect of glipizide involves increased peripheral glucose utilization via stimulating hepatic gluconeogenesis and by increasing the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors.[A177715]"
711,"Clonazepam is indicated as monotherapy or as an adjunct in the treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (petit mal variant), akinetic, and myoclonic seizures.[FDA Label][F3787] Furthermore, clonazepam may also be of some value in patients with absence spells (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides.[FDA Label][F3787] Additionally, clonazepam is also indicated for the treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, as defined in the DSM-V.[FDA Label]    Alternatively, some regional prescribing information note that clonazepam is indicated for all clinical forms of epileptic disease and seizures in adults, especially absence seizures (petit mal) including atypical absence; primary or secondarily generalised tonic-clonic (grand mal), tonic or clonic seizures; partial (focal) seizures with elementary or complex symptomatology; various forms of myoclonic seizures, myoclonus and associated abnormal movements.[L5572,F3796] Such regional label data also has clonazepam indicated for most types of epilepsy in infants and children, especially absences (petit mal), myoclonic seizures and tonic-clonic fits, whether due to primary generalized epilepsy or to secondary generalization of partial epilepsy.[F3796]                                                                                                                                                                 A benzodiazepine used to treat various seizures, including myotonic or atonic seizures, photosensitive epilepsy, and absence seizures, although tolerance may develop.[FDA Label][L5572,F3763,F3787,F3796] The agent has also been indicated for treating panic disorder.[FDA Label][A175438,L5572,F3763,F3787,F3796] The mechanism of action appears to involve the enhancement of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor responses.[FDA Label][A175438,A175441,L5572,F3763,F3787,F3796]    Since being first patented in 1960 and then released for sale from Roche in the US in 1975,[T469,T472] clonazepam has experienced a storied history in the treatment of the aforementioned medical conditions. Now available as a generic medication, the agent continues to see exceptionally high use as millions of prescriptions are written for the medication internationally every year. Unfortunately, however, like most benzodiazepines, clonazepam use has also been associated with recreational use and drug abuse.[FDA Label][L5572,F3763,F3787,F3796]The pharmacodynamic properties of clonazepam are common among benzodiazepines and include anticonvulsive, sedative, muscle relaxing and anxiolytic effects [A175423, L5572, F3763, F3787]. Animal data and electroencephalographic investigations in man have shown that clonazepam rapidly suppresses many types of paroxysmal activity including the spike and wave discharge in absence seizures (petit mal), slow spike wave, generalized spike wave, spikes with temporal or other locations, as well as irregular spikes and waves [FDA Label] [A175423, L5572, F3763, F3787]. Moreover, the agent can also decrease the frequency, amplitude, duration, and spread of discharge in minor motor seizures [FDA Label] [F3763].    Generalized EEG abnormalities are more readily suppressed by clonazepam than are focal EEG abnormalities such as focal spikes [L5572]. Clonazepam has beneficial effects in generalized and focal epilepsies [L5572].Gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is considered the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the human body [A175423, A175438, A175441]. When GABA binds to GABA(a) receptors found in neuron synapses, chloride ions are conducted across neuron cell membranes via an ion channel in the receptors [A175423, A175438, A175441, F3787]. With enough chloride ions conducted, the local, associated neuron membrane potentials are hyperpolarized - making it more difficult or less likely for action potentials to fire, ultimately resulting in less excitation of the neurons [A175423, A175438, A175441, F3787].     Subsequently, benzodiazepines like clonazepam can bind to benzodiazepine receptors that are components of various varieties of GABA(a) receptors [A175423, A175438, A175441, F3787, L5572, F3763]. This binding acts to enhance the effects of GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA(a) receptor, which ultimately enhances GABA ligand binding at the receptors [A175423, A175438, A175441, F3787, L5572, F3763]. This enhanced ligand binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA to the receptors increases the aforementioned chloride ion conduction (perhaps reportedly via an increase in the frequency of the chloride channel opening), resulting in a hyperpolarized cell membrane that prevents further excitation of the associated neuron cells [A175423, A175438, A175441, F3787, L5572, F3763]. Combined with the notion that such benzodiazepine receptor associated GABA(a) receptors exist both peripherally and in the CNS, this activity consequently facilitates various effects like sedation, hypnosis, skeletal muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, and anxiolytic action [A175423, A175438, A175441, F3787, L5572, F3763].    In particular, when out of the ordinary rapid and repetitive electrical signals are released in the CNS, it is proposed that the brain can become over-stimulated and ordinary functions are disrupted - resulting in seizure activity [A175441]. By enhancing the neuro-inhibitory activity of GABA, it is believed that clonazepam can facilitate in decreasing any excessive electrical nerve activity in the CNS that might be contributing to seizures [A175441]. Concurrently, it is also believed that clonazepam's actions in enhancing GABA effects may inhibit neuronal activity proposed to occur in amygdala-centered fear circuits - therefore assisting in the management of anxiety or panic [A175438]."
712,"Promethazine tablets and suppositories are indicated to treat rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, allergic reactions to blood or plasma, dermographism, anaphylactic reactions, sedation, nausea, vomiting, pain, motion sickness, and allergic skin reactions.[A189907,L4000] Promethazine cough syrup with phenylephrine and codeine is indicated to relieve cough and upper respiratory symptoms, and nasal congestion associated with allergy or the common cold.[L11326]Promethazine, originally known as 3,277 R.P., is an N-dimethylaminopropyl derivative of [phenothiazine] that was developed in France in 1946.[A189901] Promethazine antagonizes a variety of receptors, allowing it to be used for a number of indications including allergic reactions, pain, sedation, nausea, and vomiting.[A189907,A190153,A190159,A190150,A190171]    Promethazine was granted FDA approval before 29 March 1951.[A190177,L4000]Promethazine is is a histamine H1 antagonist that can be used for it's ability to induce sedation, reduce pain, and treat allergic reactions.[L4000] Promethazine's effects generally last 4-6h but can last up to 12h.[L4000] Patients should be counselled regarding CNS and respiratory depression, reduce seizure threshold, and bone marrow depression.[L4000]Promethazine is a an antagonist of histamine H1, post-synaptic mesolimbic dopamine, alpha adrenergic, muscarinic, and NMDA receptors.[A189907,A190153,A190159] The antihistamine action is used to treat allergic reactions.[A190150] Antagonism of muscarinic and NMDA receptors contribute to its use as a sleep aid, as well as for anxiety and tension.[A190159] Antagonism of histamine H1, muscarinic, and dopamine receptors in the medullary vomiting center make promethazine useful in the treatment of nausea and vomiting.[A190171]"
713,"Used for the prevention and treatment of rickets or osteomalacia, and to manage hypocalcemia associated with hypoparathyroidism or pseudohypoparathyroidism. Also used for the treatment of vitamin D dependent rickets, rickets or osteomalacia secondary to long-term high dose anticonvulsant therapy, early renal osteodystrophy, osteoporosis (in conjunction with calcium), and hypophosphatemia associated with Fanconi syndrome (with treatment of acidosis).A vitamin D that can be regarded as a reduction product of vitamin D2.Dihydrotachysterol is hydroxylated in the liver to 25-hydroxydihydrotachysterol, which is the major circulating active form of the drug. It does not undergo further hydroxylation by the kidney and therefore is the analogue of 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Dihydrotachysterol is effective in the elevation of serum calcium by stimulating intestinal calcium absorption and mobilizing bone calcium in the absence of parathyroid hormone and of functioning renal tissue. Dihydrotachysterol also increases renal phosphate excretion.Once hydroxylated to 25-hydroxydihydrotachysterol, the modified drug binds to the vitamin D receptor. The bound form of the vitamin D receptor serves as a transcriptional regulator of bone matrix proteins, inducing the expression of osteocalcin and suppressing synthesis of type I collagen. Vitamin D (when bound to the vitamin D receptor)stimulates the expression of a number of proteins involved in transporting calcium from the lumen of the intestine, across the epithelial cells and into blood. This stimulates intestinal calcium absorption and increases renal phosphate excretion. These are functions that are normally carried out by the parathyroid hormone. "
714,"For the treatment of Hay fever, urticaria (hives) and allergic rhinitisMequitazine is a histamine H1 antagonist (antihistamine). It competes with histamine for the normal H1-receptor sites on effector cells of the gastrointestinal tract, blood vessels and respiratory tract. It provides effective, temporary relief of sneezing, watery and itchy eyes, and runny nose due to hay fever and other upper respiratory allergies.In allergic reactions an allergen interacts with and cross-links surface IgE antibodies on mast cells and basophils. Once the mast cell-antibody-antigen complex is formed, a complex series of events occurs that eventually leads to cell-degranulation and the release of histamine (and other chemical mediators) from the mast cell or basophil. Once released, histamine can react with local or widespread tissues through histamine receptors. Histamine, acting on H1-receptors, produces pruritis, vasodilatation, hypotension, flushing, headache, tachycardia, and bronchoconstriction. Histamine also increases vascular permeability and potentiates pain. Mequitazine is a histamine H1 antagonist. It competes with histamine for the normal H1-receptor sites on effector cells of the gastrointestinal tract, blood vessels and respiratory tract. It provides effective, temporary relief of sneezing, watery and itchy eyes, and runny nose due to hay fever and other upper respiratory allergies.Mequitazine binds to the histamine H1 receptor sites on effector cells in the gastrointestinal tract, blood vessels, and respiratory tract. This blocks the action of endogenous histamine, which subsequently leads to temporary relief of the negative symptoms brought on by histamine."
715,"[L37599]Atazanavir (formerly known as BMS-232632) is an antiretroviral drug of the protease inhibitor (PI) class. Like other antiretrovirals, it is used to treat infection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Atazanavir is distinguished from other PIs in that it can be given once daily (rather than requiring multiple doses per day) and has lesser effects on the patient's lipid profile (the amounts of cholesterol and other fatty substances in the blood). Like other protease inhibitors, it is used only in combination with other HIV medications. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved atazanavir on June 20, 2003.Atazanavir (ATV) is an azapeptide HIV-1 protease inhibitor (PI) with activity against Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1). HIV-1 protease is an enzyme required for the proteolytic cleavage of the viral polyprotein precursors into the individual functional proteins found in infectious HIV-1. Atazanavir binds to the protease active site and inhibits the activity of the enzyme. This inhibition prevents cleavage of the viral polyproteins resulting in the formation of immature non-infectious viral particles. Atazanivir is pharmacologically related but structurally different from other protease inhibitors and other currently available antiretrovirals.[A1697]    Atazanavir exhibits anti-HIV-1 activity with a mean 50% effective concentration (EC50) in the absence of human serum of 2 to 5 nM against a variety of laboratory and clinical HIV-1 isolates grown in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, macrophages, CEM-SS cells, and MT-2 cells.[L48636]     Atazanavir has activity against HIV-1 Group M subtype viruses A, B, C, D, AE, AG, F, G, and J isolates in cell culture. Atazanavir has variable activity against HIV-2 isolates (1.9-32 nM), with EC50 values above the EC50 values of failure isolates. [L48636]    HIV-1 isolates with a decreased susceptibility to atazanavir have been selected in cell culture and obtained from patients treated with atazanavir or atazanavir with ritonavir. HIV-1 isolates with 93- to 183-fold reduced susceptibility to atazanavir from three different viral strains were selected in cell culture for 5 months. The substitutions in these HIV-1 viruses that contributed to atazanavir resistance include I50L, N88S, I84V, A71V, and M46I. Changes were also observed at the protease cleavage sites following drug selection. Recombinant viruses containing the I50L substitution without other major PI substitutions were growth impaired and displayed increased susceptibility in cell culture to other PIs (amprenavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir). The I50L and I50V substitutions yielded selective resistance to atazanavir and amprenavir, respectively, and did not appear to be cross-resistant.[L48636]     Concentration- and dose-dependent prolongation of the PR interval in the electrocardiogram has been observed in healthy subjects receiving atazanavir. In placebo-controlled Study AI424-076, the mean (±SD) maximum change in PR interval from the predose value was 24 (±15) msec following oral dosing with 400 mg of atazanavir (n=65) compared to 13 (±11) msec following dosing with placebo (n=67). The PR interval prolongations in this study were asymptomatic. There is limited information on the potential for a pharmacodynamic interaction in humans between atazanavir and other drugs that prolong the PR interval of the electrocardiogram.    Electrocardiographic effects of atazanavir were determined in a clinical pharmacology study of 72 healthy subjects. Oral doses of 400 mg (maximum recommended dosage) and 800 mg (twice the maximum recommended dosage) were compared with placebo; there was no concentration-dependent effect of atazanavir on the QTc interval (using Fridericia’s correction). In 1793 subjects with HIV-1 infection, receiving antiretroviral regimens, QTc prolongation was comparable in the atazanavir and comparator regimens. No atazanavir-treated healthy subject or subject with HIV-1 infection in clinical trials had a QTc interval >500 msecAtazanavir selectively inhibits the virus-specific processing of viral Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins in HIV-1 infected cells by binding to the active site of HIV-1 protease, thus preventing the formation of mature virions. Atazanavir is not active against HIV-2.[L48636] "
716,"For the treatment of adult patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who have not responded to or whose disease has progressed during treatment with at least one standard alkylating-agent containing regimenFludarabine is a chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of hematological malignancies. It is commonly marketed under the brand name Fludara.Fludarabine is a chemotherapy drug used in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. It acts at DNA polymerase alpha, ribonucleotide reductase and DNA primase, results in the inhibition of DNA synthesis, and destroys the cancer cells.Fludarabine phosphate is rapidly dephosphorylated to 2-fluoro-ara-A and then phosphorylated intracellularly by deoxycytidine kinase to the active triphosphate, 2-fluoro-ara-ATP. This metabolite appears to act by inhibiting DNA polymerase alpha, ribonucleotide reductase and DNA primase, thus inhibiting DNA synthesis. The mechanism of action of this antimetabolite is not completely characterized and may be multi-faceted."
717,"Diphenhydramine is a first-generation histamine H1 receptor antagonist (H1 antihistamine) that is widely available as a non-prescription, over-the-counter (OTC) medication. As an OTC medication, diphenhydramine is typically formulated as tablets and creams indicated for use in treating sneezing, runny nose, itchy/watery eyes, itching of nose or throat, insomnia, pruritis, urticaria, insect bites/stings, allergic rashes, and nausea [L5263, L5266, L5269, F3379, A174541].    Additionally, when the use of oral diphenhydramine is impractical, there are also prescription-only formulations such as diphenhydramine injection products that are effective in adults and pediatric patients (other than premature infants and neonates) for:  i) the amelioration of allergic reactions to blood or plasma, in anaphylaxis as an adjunct to epinephrine and other standard measures after acute allergic reaction symptoms have been controlled, and for other uncomplicated allergic conditions of the immediate type when oral therapy is impossible or contraindicated [F3352];  ii) the active treatment of motion sickness [F3352]; and  iii) use in parkinsonism when oral therapy is impossible or contraindicated, as follows: parkinsonism in the elderly who are unable to tolerate more potent agents; mild cases of parkinsonism in other age groups, and in other cases of parkinsonism in combination with centrally acting anticholinergic agents [F3352].Diphenhydramine - perhaps known most commonly as its brand name formulation Benadryl - is a first-generation H1 receptor antihistamine that is used extensively for the treatment of seasonal allergies, insect bites and stings, and rashes [L5263, L5266, L5269, F3379]. However, it also has antiemetic, antitussive, hypnotic, and antiparkinson properties [L5269, F3352]. As histamine receptors exist both peripherally and in the central nervous system, diphenhydramine has been shown to cause sedation due to its competitive antagonism of histamine H1 receptors within the central nervous system [L5263, L5266, L5269, F3379, A174541]. While its use in allergy therapy can sometimes fall out of favor due to its sedative effect, diphenhydramine has been repurposed for use within many non-prescription over-the-counter sleep aids and cough-and-cold medications that have been marketed for ""night time"" use [L5263, L5281, L5287].     Diphenhydramine is also used in combination with [DB14132] as the anti-nausea drug [DB00985] where it is utilized primarily for its antagonism of H1 histamine receptors within the vestibular system [A1540].    Diphenhydramine has also been shown to be implicated in a number of neurotransmitter systems that affect behaviour including dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, acetylcholine, and opioid [A1539]. As a result, diphenhydramine is being investigated for its anxiolytic and anti-depressant properties.Diphenhydramine has anti-histaminic (H1-receptor), anti-emetic, anti-vertigo and sedative and hypnotic properties [L5281]. The anti-histamine action occurs by blocking the spasmogenic and congestive effects of histamine by competing with histamine for H1 receptor sites on effector cells, preventing but not reversing responses mediated by histamine alone [L5281]. Such receptor sites may be found in the gut, uterus, large blood vessels, bronchial muscles, and elsewhere [L5281]. Anti-emetic action is by inhibition at the medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone [L5281]. Anti-vertigo action is by a central antimuscarinic effect on the vestibular apparatus and the integrative vomiting center and medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone of the midbrain [L5281].Diphenhydramine predominantly works via the antagonism of H1 (Histamine 1) receptors [L5263, L5266, L5269, F3379, A174541]. Such H1 receptors are located on respiratory smooth muscles, vascular endothelial cells, the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), cardiac tissue, immune cells, the uterus, and the central nervous system (CNS) neurons [L5263, L5266, L5269, F3379, A174541]. When the H1 receptor is stimulated in these tissues it produces a variety of actions including increased vascular permeability, promotion of vasodilation causing flushing, decreased atrioventricular (AV) node conduction time, stimulation of sensory nerves of airways producing coughing, smooth muscle contraction of bronchi and the GIT, and eosinophilic chemotaxis that promotes the allergic immune response [L5263, L5266, L5269, F3379, A174541].    Ultimately, diphenhydramine functions as an inverse agonist at H1 receptors, and subsequently reverses effects of histamine on capillaries, reducing allergic reaction symptoms [L5263, L5266, L5269, F3379, A174541]. Moreover, since diphenhydramine is a first-generation antihistamine, it readily crosses the blood-brain barrier and inversely agonizes the H1 CNS receptors, resulting in drowsiness, and suppressing the medullary cough center [L5263, L5266, L5269, F3379, A174541].    Furthermore, H1 receptors are similar to muscarinic receptors [L5263, L5266, L5269, F3379, A174541]. Consequently, diphenhydramine also acts as an antimuscarinic [L5263, L5266, L5269, F3379, A174541]. It does so by behaving as a competitive antagonist of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, resulting in its use as an antiparkinson medication [L5263, L5266, L5269, F3379, A174541].    Lastly, diphenhydramine has also demonstrated activity as an intracellular sodium channel blocker, resulting in possible local anesthetic properties [L5263]."
718,"Atorvastatin is indicated for the treatment of several types of dyslipidemias, including primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia in adults, hypertriglyceridemia, primary dysbetalipoproteinemia, homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in adolescent patients with failed dietary modifications.[A177397]    Dyslipidemia describes an elevation of plasma cholesterol, triglycerides or both as well as to the presence of low levels of high-density lipoprotein. This condition represents an increased risk for the development of atherosclerosis.[L6025]     Atorvastatin is indicated, in combination with dietary modifications, to prevent cardiovascular events in patients with cardiac risk factors and/or abnormal lipid profiles.[A177397]    Atorvastatin can be used as a preventive agent for myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization, and angina, in patients without coronary heart disease but with multiple risk factors and in patients with type 2 diabetes without coronary heart disease but multiple risk factors.[A177397]    Atorvastatin may be used as a preventive agent for non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal and non-fatal stroke, revascularization procedures, hospitalization for congestive heart failure and angina in patients with coronary heart disease.[A177397]    Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD. Statin-indicated conditions include diabetes mellitus, clinical atherosclerosis (including myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stable angina, documented coronary artery disease, stroke, trans ischemic attack (TIA), documented carotid disease, peripheral artery disease, and claudication), abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and severely elevated LDL-C levels.[A181087, A181406]Atorvastatin (Lipitor®), is a lipid-lowering drug included in the statin class of medications. By inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver, statins lower abnormal cholesterol and lipid levels, and ultimately reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid. This conversion is a critical metabolic reaction involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport, including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as ""bad cholesterol""), and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing statins is considered standard practice for patients following any cardiovascular event, and for people who are at moderate to high risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The evidence supporting statin use, coupled with minimal side effects and long term benefits, has resulted in wide use of this medication in North America.[A181087, A181406]    Atorvastatin and other statins including [lovastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [simvastatin] are considered first-line treatment options for dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] The increasing use of this class of drugs is largely attributed to the rise in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) (such as heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke) in many countries.[A181084] An elevated cholesterol level (elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in particular) is a significant risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Several landmark studies demonstrate that the use of statins is associated with both a reduction in LDL levels and CVD risk.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins were shown to reduce the incidences of all-cause mortality, including fatal and non-fatal CVD, as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Some evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within five years) statin use leads to a 20%-22% relative reduction in the number of major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]    Atorvastatin was first synthesized in 1985 by Dr. Bruce Roth and approved by the FDA in 1996.[T568] It is a pentasubstituted pyrrole [A177415] formed by two contrasting moieties with an achiral heterocyclic core unit and a 3,5-dihydroxypentanoyl side chain identical to its parent compound.[T571] Unlike other members of the statin group, atorvastatin is an active compound and therefore does not require activation.[A177436]Atorvastatin is an oral antilipemic agent that reversibly inhibits HMG-CoA reductase. It lowers total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apo B), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and triglyceride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease, and high ratios are associated with a higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, atorvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[A174580,A181087,A181406,A181925]     Elevated cholesterol levels (and high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in particular) are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Clinical studies have shown that atorvastatin reduces LDL-C and total cholesterol by 36-53%.[A177415] In patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia, atorvastatin reduced the levels of intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol.[A177397] It has also been suggested that atorvastatin can limit the extent of angiogenesis, which can be useful in the treatment of chronic subdural hematoma.[A177388]    **Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis**    Atorvastatin, like other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, is associated with a risk of drug-induced myopathy characterized by muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness in conjunction with elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK). Myopathy often manifests as rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria. The risk of statin-induced myopathy is dose-related, and the symptoms of myopathy are typically resolved upon drug discontinuation. Results from observational studies suggest that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.[A182258]    **Liver Dysfunction**    Statins, like some other lipid-lowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Persistent elevations (> 3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] occurring on two or more occasions) in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7% of patients who received atorvastatin in clinical trials. This effect appears to be dose-related.[F4670,F4673]    **Endocrine Effects**    Statins are associated with a risk of increased serum HbA1c and glucose levels. An _in vitro_ study demonstrated a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on human pancreatic islet β cells following treatment with atorvastatin. Moreover, insulin secretion rates decreased relative to control.[A182012]    HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors interfere with cholesterol synthesis and may theoretically interfere with the production of adrenal and/or gonadal steroids. Clinical studies with atorvastatin and other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have suggested that these agents do not affect plasma cortisol concentrations, basal plasma testosterone concentration, or adrenal reserve. However, the effect of statins on male fertility has not been fully investigated. The effects of statins on the pituitary-gonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown.[F4673]    **Cardiovascular**    Significant decreases in circulating ubiquinone levels in patients treated with atorvastatin and other statins have been observed. The clinical significance of a potential long-term statin-induced deficiency of ubiquinone has not been established. It has been reported that a decrease in myocardial ubiquinone levels could lead to impaired cardiac function in patients with borderline congestive heart failure.[F4673]    **Lipoprotein A**    In some patients, the beneficial effect of lowered total cholesterol and LDL-C levels may be partly blunted by the concomitant increase in Lp(a) lipoprotein concentrations. Present knowledge suggests the importance of high Lp(a) levels as an emerging risk factor for coronary heart disease.[F4673] Further studies have demonstrated statins affect Lp(a) levels differently in patients with dyslipidemia depending on their apo(a) phenotype; statins increase Lp(a) levels exclusively in patients with the low molecular weight apo(a) phenotype.[A181418]Atorvastatin is a statin medication and a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.[A177388,A181421] Atorvastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, which increases hepatic uptake of LDL. Atorvastatin also reduces Very-Low-Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol (VLDL-C), serum triglycerides (TG) and Intermediate Density Lipoproteins (IDL), as well as the number of apolipoprotein B (apo B) containing particles, but increases High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C).     _In vitro_ and _in vivo_ animal studies also demonstrate that atorvastatin exerts vasculoprotective effects independent of its lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.[A181424] These effects include improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response. Statins were also found to bind allosterically to β2 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an essential role in leukocyte trafficking and T cell activation.[A181559]"

Bone resorption by osteoclasts causes local acidification, releasing the bisphosphonate, which is taken into the osteoclast by fluid-phase endocytosis.[A959] Endocytic vesicles become acidified, releasing bisphosphonates into the cytosol of osteoclasts where they act.[A959]    Osteoclasts mediate resorption of bone.[A6366] When osteoclasts bind to bone they form podosomes, ring structures of F-actin.[A6366] Disruption of the podosomes causes osteoclasts to detach from bones, preventing bone resorption.[A6366]    First generation bisphosphonates closely mimic the structure of pyrophosphate, which can be incorporated into ATP anologues that cannot be hydrolyzed, disrupting all ATP mediated actions of osteoclasts.[A203360]"

Increased intracellular concentrations of calcium may promote activation of contractile proteins (e.g., actin, myosin). Deslanoside also acts on the electrical activity of the heart, increasing the slope of phase 4 depolarization, shortening the action potential duration, and decreasing the maximal diastolic potential."
721,"Vigabatrin is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of refractory complex partial seizures in patients 2 years of age and older who have had inadequate responses to multiple previous treatments (i.e. not to be used for first-line therapy).[L13616] It is also indicated as monotherapy in the treatment of infantile spasms in patients between 1 month and 2 years of age for whom the potential benefits outweigh the risk of vision loss.[L13616]Vigabatrin is an analog of gamma-aminobutyric acid ([GABA]), the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, used in the treatment of refractory seizures and infantile spasms.[L13616] It irreversibly inhibits the enzyme responsible for GABA metabolism, thereby increasing levels of circulating GABA. Although administered as a racemic mixture, only the S(+) enantiomer is pharmacologically active.[A202037]    It was first introduced as an antiepileptic agent in the United Kingdom in 1989 and was used extensively until 1997, when an association with vision loss became apparent.[A202124] Its use is now generally reserved for patients who have failed alternative therapies, and its US approval by the FDA in 2009 mandated the creation of a drug registry to monitor patients for visual deficits.[L13661,A202124]Vigabatrin is an antiepileptic agent chemically unrelated to other anticonvulsants. Vigabatrin prevents the metabolism of GABA by irreversibly inhibiting GABA transaminase (GABA-T). As vigabatrin is an irreversible inhibitor of gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase (GABA-T), its duration of effect is thought to be dependent on the rate of GABA-T re-synthesis rather than on the rate of drug elimination.[L13616]  Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory transmitter throughout the central nervous system, and the potentiation of GABAergic neurotransmission is therefore a crucial mechanism through which antiepileptic agents may combat the pathologic excitatory neurotransmission seen in epilepsy.[A202064] Vigabatrin increases concentrations of GABA in the central nervous system by irreversibly inhibiting the enzymes responsible for its metabolism to succinic semialdehyde: gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase (GABA-T).[L13616] "

Following oral administration, pilocarpine increased the mean salivary flow rate by 2- to lO-folds than placebo. Its peak levels were maintained for at least one to two hours.[A262036, L48556] Pilocarpine increases smooth muscle tone, contracts the pupillary and iris sphincter muscles, and induces miosis.[A262036, L48556, L48566, L48631]    Because pilocarpine may affect all five muscarinic receptor subtypes, it is associated with parasympathetic side effects.[A262016, A262041]The muscarinic M3 receptor is expressed in various endocrine and exocrine glands, including the gastric and salivary glands.[A262041] It is also found in smooth muscle cells in pupillary sphincter and ciliary bodies.

Rauwolfia alkaloids work by controlling nerve impulses along certain nerve pathways. As a result, they act on the heart and blood vessels to lower blood pressure.Deserpidine's mechanism of action is through inhibition of the ATP/Mg2+ pump responsible for the sequestering of neurotransmitters into storage vesicles located in the presynaptic neuron. The neurotransmitters that are not sequestered in the storage vesicle are readily metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO) causing a reduction in catecholamines."

727,"To be used as an adjunct to dietary therapy to prevent cardiovascular events. May be used as secondary prevention in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) to reduce the risk of requiring coronary revascularization procedures, for reducing progression of coronary atherosclerosis in hypercholesterolemic patients with CHD, and for the treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslidipidemia. Fluvastatin is an antilipemic agent that competitively inhibits hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. HMG-CoA reductase catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid, the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Fluvastatin belongs to a class of medications called statins and is used to reduce plasma cholesterol levels and prevent cardiovascular disease. It is also the first entirely synthetic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and is structurally distinct from the fungal derivatives of this therapeutic class. Fluvastatin is a racemate comprising equimolar amounts of (3R,5S)- and (3S,5R)-fluvastatin.Fluvastatin, the first synthetically-derived HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, is a hydrophilic, acidic, antilipemic agent used to lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels associated with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia (Fredrickson types IIa and IIb), to slow the progression of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with CHD and as secondary prevention therapy in patients with CHD to reduce the risk of requiring coronary revascularization procedures. Although similar to lovastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin, fluvastatin has a shorter half-life, no active metabolites, extensive protein binding, and minimal CSF penetration. Fluvastatin acts primarily in the liver. It is prepared as a racemate of two erythro enantiomers of which the 3R,5S enantiomer exerts the pharmacologic effect. Fluvastatin selectively and competitively inhibits the hepatic enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. HMG-CoA reductase is responsible for converting HMG-CoA to mevalonate, the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Inhibition results in a decrease in hepatic cholesterol levels which stimulates the synthesis of LDL receptors and increases hepatic uptake of LDL cholesterol. The end result is decreased levels of plasma total and LDL cholesterol. "
728,"For the management of the signs and symptoms of active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to improve physical function and to slow the progression of structural damage associated with the disease. Has also been used for the prevention of acute and chronic rejection in recipients of solid organ trasnplants and is designated by the FDA as an orphan drug for this use.Leflunomide is a pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor belonging to the DMARD (disease-modifying antirheumatic drug) class of drugs, which are chemically and pharmacologically very heterogeneous. Leflunomide was approved by FDA and in many other countries (e.g., Canada, Europe) in 1999.Leflunomide is a pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor indicated in adults for the treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA is an auto-immune disease characterized by high T-cell activity. T cells have two pathways to synthesize pyrimidines: the salvage pathways and the de novo synthesis. At rest, T lymphocytes meet their metabolic requirements by the salvage pathway. Activated lymphocytes need to expand their pyrimidine pool 7- to 8-fold, while the purine pool is expanded only 2- to 3-fold. To meet the need for more pyrimidines, activated T cells use the de novo pathway for pyrimidine synthesis. Therefore, activated T cells, which are dependent on de novo pyrimidine synthesis, will be more affected by leflunomide's inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase than other cell types that use the salvage pathway of pyrimidine synthesis.Leflunomide is a prodrug that is rapidly and almost completely metabolized following oral administration to its pharmacologically active metabolite, A77 1726. This metabolite is responsible for essentially all of the drug's activity in-vivo. The mechanism of action of leflunomide has not been fully determined, but appears to primarily involve regulation of autoimmune lymphocytes. It has been suggested that leflunomide exerts its immunomodulating effects by preventing the expansion of activated autoimmune lymphocytes via interferences with cell cycle progression. In-vitro data indicates that leflunomide interferes with cell cycle progression by inhibiting dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (a mitochondrial enzyme involved in de novo pyrimidine ribonucleotide uridine monophosphate (rUMP)synthesis) and has antiproliferative activity. Human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase consists of 2 domains: an α/β-barrel domain containing the active site and an α-helical domain that forms a tunnel leading to the active site. A77 1726 binds to the hydrophobic tunnel at a site near the flavin mononucleotide. Inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase by A77 1726 prevents production of rUMP by the de novo pathway; such inhibition leads to decreased rUMP levels, decreased DNA and RNA synthesis, inhibition of cell proliferation, and G1 cell cycle arrest. It is through this action that leflunomide inhibits autoimmune T-cell proliferation and production of autoantibodies by B cells. Since salvage pathways are expected to sustain cells arrested in the G1 phase, the activity of leflunomide is cytostatic rather than cytotoxic. Other effects that result from reduced rUMP levels include interference with adhesion of activated lymphocytes to the synovial vascular endothelial cells, and increased synthesis of immunosuppressive cytokines such as transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). Leflunomide is also a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Tyrosine kinases activate signalling pathways leading to DNA repair, apoptosis and cell proliferation. Inhibition of tyrosine kinases can help to treating cancer by preventing repair of tumor cells. "
729,"The FDA monograph states that rosuvastatin is indicated as an adjunct to diet in the treatment of triglyceridemia, Primary Dysbetalipoproteinemia (Type III Hyperlipoproteinemia), and Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia.[F4649]    The Health Canada monograph for rosuvastatin further specifies that rosuvastatin is indicated for the reduction of elevated total cholesterol (Total-C), LDL-C, ApoB, the Total-C/HDL-C ratio and triglycerides (TG) and for increasing HDL-C in hyperlipidemic and dyslipidemic conditions when response to diet and exercise alone has been inadequate. It is also indicated for the prevention of major cardiovascular events (including risk of myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and coronary artery revascularization) in adult patients without documented history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events, but with at least two conventional risk factors for cardiovascular disease.[F4652]    Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD. Statin-indicated conditions include diabetes mellitus, clinical atherosclerosis (including myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stable angina, documented coronary artery disease, stroke, trans ischemic attack (TIA), documented carotid disease, peripheral artery disease, and claudication), abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and severely elevated LDL-C levels.[A181087, A181406]Rosuvastatin, also known as the brand name product Crestor, is a lipid-lowering drug that belongs to the statin class of medications, which are used to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and manage elevated lipid levels by inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as ""bad cholesterol""), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]    Rosuvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [simvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] This is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]    While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, rosuvastatin is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg rosuvastatin per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decreases in LDL cholesterol levels, which is about three-fold more potent than [atorvastatin]'s effects on LDL cholesterol.[A181409,A1793] However, the results of the SATURN trial[A181427] concluded that despite this difference in potency, there was no difference in their effect on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.    Rosuvastatin is also a unique member of the class of statins due to its high hydrophilicity which increases hepatic uptake at the site of action, low bioavailability, and minimal metabolism via the Cytochrome P450 system.[A181523] This last point results in less risk of drug-drug interactions compared to [atorvastatin], [lovastatin], and [simvastatin], which are all extensively metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many commonly used drugs.[A181460] Drugs such as [ciclosporin], [gemfibrozil], and some antiretrovirals are more likely to interact with this statin through antagonism of OATP1B1 organic anion transporter protein 1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin.[F4649, F4652]Rosuvastatin is a synthetic, enantiomerically pure antilipemic agent. It is used to lower total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apoB), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and trigleride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease and high ratios are associated with higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, rosuvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[A181087, A181406]    Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]    **Skeletal Muscle Effects**    Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin. These risks can occur at any dose level, but are increased at the highest dose (40 mg). Rosuvastatin should be prescribed with caution in patients with predisposing factors for myopathy (e.g., age ≥ 65 years, inadequately treated hypothyroidism, renal impairment).    The risk of myopathy during treatment with rosuvastatin may be increased with concurrent administration of some other lipid-lowering therapies (such as [fenofibrate] or [niacin]), [gemfibrozil], [cyclosporine], [atazanavir]/[ritonavir], [lopinavir]/ritonavir, or [simeprevir].  Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin, coadministered with [colchicine], and caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing these two medications together.[F4649]     Real-world data from observational studies has suggested that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.[A182258]    **Liver Enzyme Abnormalities**    Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin. In most cases, the elevations were transient and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. There were two cases of jaundice, for which a relationship to rosuvastatin therapy could not be determined, which resolved after discontinuation of therapy. There were no cases of liver failure or irreversible liver disease in these trials.[F4649]    **Endocrine Effects**    Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin calcium tablets. Based on clinical trial data with rosuvastatin, in some instances these increases may exceed the threshold for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.[F4649]    An in vitro study found that [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], and [pitavastatin] exhibited a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on human pancreas islet β cells, with reductions in cell viability of 32, 41, 34 and 29%, respectively, versus control]. Moreover, insulin secretion rates were decreased by 34, 30, 27 and 19%, respectively, relative to control.[A182012]    HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors interfere with cholesterol synthesis and lower cholesterol levels and, as such, might theoretically blunt adrenal or gonadal steroid hormone production. Rosuvastatin demonstrated no effect upon nonstimulated cortisol levels and no effect on thyroid metabolism as assessed by TSH plasma concentration. In rosuvastatin treated patients, there was no impairment of adrenocortical reserve and no reduction in plasma cortisol concentrations. Clinical studies with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have suggested that these agents do not reduce plasma testosterone concentration. The effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on male fertility have not been studied. The effects, if any, on the pituitarygonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown.[F4652]    **Cardiovascular**    Ubiquinone levels were not measured in rosuvastatin clinical trials, however significant decreases in circulating ubiquinone levels in patients treated with other statins have been observed. The clinical significance of a potential long-term statin-induced deficiency of ubiquinone has not been established. It has been reported that a decrease in myocardial ubiquinone levels could lead to impaired cardiac function in patients with borderline congestive heart failure.[F4652]    **Lipoprotein A**    In some patients, the beneficial effect of lowered total cholesterol and LDL-C levels may be partly blunted by a concomitant increase in the Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] concentrations. Present knowledge suggests the importance of high Lp(a) levels as an emerging risk factor for coronary heart disease. It is thus desirable to maintain and reinforce lifestyle changes in high-risk patients placed on rosuvastatin therapy.[F4652] Further studies have demonstrated statins affect Lp(a) levels differently in patients with dyslipidemia depending on their apo(a) phenotype; statins increase Lp(a) levels exclusively in patients with the low molecular weight apo(a) phenotype.[A181418]Rosuvastatin is a statin medication and a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.[A181421] Rosuvastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors which increases hepatic uptake of LDL. Rosuvastatin also inhibits hepatic synthesis of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL).[F4649] The overall effect is a decrease in plasma LDL and VLDL.     In vitro and in vivo animal studies also demonstrate that rosuvastatin exerts vasculoprotective effects independent of its lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.[A181424] This includes improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response.    Statins have also been found to bind allosterically to β2 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an important role in leukocyte trafficking and in T cell activation.[A181559]    Rosuvastatin exerts an anti-inflammatory effect on rat mesenteric microvascular endothelium by attenuating leukocyte rolling, adherence and transmigration.[A1807] The drug also modulates nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression and reduces ischemic-reperfusion injuries in rat hearts.[A1787] Rosuvastatin increases the bioavailability of nitric oxide[A1807,A1799,A1787] by upregulating NOS[A1791] and by increasing the stability of NOS through post-transcriptional polyadenylation.[A1796] It is unclear as to how rosuvastatin brings about these effects though they may be due to decreased concentrations of mevalonic acid."
730,"For the treatment (in combination with amphotericin B) of serious infections caused by susceptible strains of Candida (septicemia, endocarditis and urinary system infections) and/or Cryptococcus (meningitis and pulmonary infections).A fluorinated cytosine analog that is used as an antifungal agent.Flucytosine is an antimetabolite that acts as an antifungal agent with in vitro and in vivo activity against Candida and Cryptococcus. Flucytosine enters the fungal cell via cytosine permease; thus, flucytosine is metabolized to 5-fluorouracil within fungal organisms. The 5-fluorouracil is extensively incorporated into fungal RNA and inhibits synthesis of both DNA and RNA. The result is unbalanced growth and death of the fungal organism. Antifungal synergism between Ancobon and polyene antibiotics, particularly amphotericin B, has been reported.Although the exact mode of action is unknown, it has been proposed that flucytosine acts directly on fungal organisms by competitive inhibition of purine and pyrimidine uptake and indirectly by intracellular metabolism to 5-fluorouracil. Flucytosine enters the fungal cell via cytosine permease; thus, flucytosine is metabolized to 5-fluorouracil within fungal organisms. The 5-fluorouracil is extensively incorporated into fungal RNA and inhibits synthesis of both DNA and RNA. The result is unbalanced growth and death of the fungal organism.

However, receptor blockade is often accompanied by a series of secondary alterations in central dopamine metabolism and function which may contribute to both pimozide's therapeutic and untoward effects. In addition, pimozide, in common with other antipsychotic drugs, has various effects on other central nervous system receptor systems which are not fully characterized. Pimozide also has less potential for inducing sedation and hypotension as it has more specific dopamine receptor blocking activity than other neuroleptic agents (and is therefore a suitable alternative to haloperidol).The ability of pimozide to suppress motor and phonic tics in Tourette's Disorder is thought to be primarily a function of its dopaminergic blocking activity. Pimozide binds and inhibits the dopamine D2 receptor in the CNS. "
732,"Capecitabine is indicated as treatment for a variety of cancer types. For colorectal cancer, capecitabine is indicated as a single agent or a component of a combination chemotherapy regiment for the adjuvant treatment of stage III colon cancer and treatment unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer. It can also be used as a part of a combination chemotherapy perioperative treatment of adult locally advanced rectal cancer.[L44657] For breast cancer, capecitabine is indicated for advanced or metastatic breast cancer as a single agent if an anthracycline- or taxane-containing chemotherapy is not indicated or as a regimen with docetaxel after disease progression on prior anthracycline-containing chemotherapy.[L44657] For gastric, esophageal, or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer, capecitabine is indicated as a component of a combination chemotherapy treatment for the treatment of adult unresectable or metastatic gastric, esophageal, or GEJ cancer or adult HER2-overexpressing metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who have not received prior treatment for metastatic disease.[L44657] Finally, for pancreatic cancer, capecitabine is indicated as adjuvant treatment for adult pancreatic adenocarcinoma as a component of a combination chemotherapy regimen.[L44657]Capecitabine is an orally-administered chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of metastatic breast and colorectal cancers. Capecitabine is a prodrug, that is enzymatically converted to fluorouracil (antimetabolite) in the tumor, where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumor tissue.Capecitabine is a fluoropyrimidine carbamate belonging to a group of antineoplastic agents called antimetabolites, which kill cancerous cells by interfering with DNA synthesis.[A256242,A841] It is an orally administered systemic prodrug that has little pharmacologic activity until it is converted to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) by enzymes that are expressed in higher concentrations in many tumors.[A256247] Capecitabine was designed specifically to overcome the disadvantages of 5-FU and to mimic the infusional pharmacokinetics of 5-FU without the associated complexity and complications of central venous access and infusion pumps.[A256242] Particularly, since the enzymes converting 5-FU into active metabolites exist in the gastrointestinal tract, infusion of 5-FU can have gastrointestinal toxicity while also losing efficacy.[A256252] Since capecitabine can be transported intact across the intestinal mucosa, it can be selectively delivered 5-FU to tumor tissues through enzymatic conversion preferentially inside tumor cells.[A256252]    5-FU exerts its pharmacological action through the inhibition and interference of 3 main targets: thymidylate synthase, DNA, and RNA, leading through protein synthesis disruption and apoptosis.[A841,A256152] Population-based exposure-effect analyses demonstrated a positive association between AUC of 5-FU and grade 3-4 hyperbilirubinemia.[L44657]Capecitabine is metabolized to 5-fluorouracil in vivo by carboxylesterases, cytidine deaminase, and thymidine phosphorylase/uridine phosphorylase sequentially.[L44657,A256027,A256142,A256147,A32078] 5-fluorouracil is further metabolized through a series of enzymatic reactions into 3 main active metabolites: 5-fluorouridine triphosphate (5-FUTP), 5-fluoro-2’-deoxyuridine monophosphate (5-FdUMP), and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine triphosphate (5-FdUTP).[A256062,A256027,A256077]. These metabolites cause cell injury by two different mechanisms. First, FdUMP and the folate cofactor, N5-10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (CH2THF), bind to thymidylate synthase (TS) to form a covalently bound ternary complex.[L44657] TS is an enzyme that catalyzes the methylation of deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP).[A256152,A256077] Under normal physiological conditions, dUMP binds to TS first before CH2THF, followed by a 1,4 or Michael addition from the pyrimidine C (6)atom to the Cys146 nucleophile.[A256152,A256157] If correctly positioned, dUMP, CH2THF, and TS would form a ternary complex to facilitate the donation of the methyl group from CH2THF to dUMP.[A256152] However, the substitution of dUMP with FdUMP results in a new time-dependent TS–FdUMP–CH2THF complex. Since the fluorine group prevents dissociation of FdUMP from the pyrimidine ring, the whole complex is rendered irreversibly deactivated, terming this reaction ""suicide inhibition"".[A256152,A256162] TS inhibition prevents the conversion of dUMP to dTMP, depleting the pool of dTMP that could be phosphorylated into dTTP to be incorporated as DNA nucleotides. This disrupts the nucleotides balance, particularly the the ATP/dTTP ratio, thus impairing DNA synthesis and repair and causing apoptosis.[A256167,A256152]     5-FdUMP can also be phosphorylated into 5-FdUTP, further increasing the pool of dUTP base to potentially overwhelm the activity of dUTPase.[A256177] Coupled with the decrease in dTTP, 5-FdUMP, and 5-FdUTP increase the probability of mistakenly incorporating a uracil base into DNA strands in place of thymine. Although this mistake can often be resolved by the nucleotide excision repair enzyme uracil-DNA-glycosylase (UDG), the high (F)dUTP/dTTP ratio would result in re-incorporation of uracil into DNA, leading to a futile cycle of misincorporation, excision, and repair.[A256172,A841] Repeated base excision repair can result in abasic sites, which can lead to DNA mutagenesis and thus protein miscoding, replication forks collapse, and DNA fragmentation through single or double strand breaks [A256177,A256182,A256187,A256192]     However, several reports have found that the incorporation of uracil in genomic DNA does not significantly affect the cytotoxicity of 5-FU, suggesting that the cytotoxic effect of 5-FU is dominated by the perturbation of RNA through 5-FUTP.[A256197,A256202] Similar to 5-dFUTP, 5-FUTP can be mistakenly incorporated into RNA in place of regular UTP and disrupt regular RNA biology through various mechanisms. 5-FUTP can be incorporated into the spliceosomal U2 snRNA at pseudouridylated sites to prevent further pseudouridylation and thus pre-mrNA splicing. 5-FUTP can also change the structure of U4 and U6 snRNA and reduce the turnover rate of U1 snrNA once incorporated.[A256207] For tRNA, 5-FUTP can affect tRNA's post-transcriptional RNA modifications activity, particularly by inhbiting pseudouridine synthase through formation of covalent complex.[A256212,A256217] Recently, the effect of 5-FUTP on miRNAs and lncRNA was also observed through profound changes in expression, although the precise mechanism is still unknown.[A256222,A256227,A256232]    Although the main mechanism of 5-FU cytotoxicity was thought to be attributed to DNA damages, recent reports have shown that the majority of 5-FU pharmacological action is mediated through RNA, since 5-FU is accumulated ~3000- to 15 000-fold more in RNA compared to that of DNA.[A256237]   "
733,"Used to elicit acute cardiovascular responses (cardiac stumulant), similar to those produced by exercise, in order to aid in diagnosing the presence or absence of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients who cannot exercise adequately.Arbutamine, administered through a closed-loop, computer-controlled drug-delivery system, is indicated to elicit acute cardiovascular responses, similar to those produced by exercise, in order to aid in diagnosing the presence or absence of coronary artery disease in patients who cannot exercise adequately .Arbutamine is a synthetic catecholamine with positive chronotropic and inotropic properties. The chronotropic (increase in heart rate) and inotropic (increase in force of contraction) effects of arbutamine serve to mimic exercise by increasing cardiac work (producing stress) and provoke myocardial ischemia in patients with compromised coronary arteries. The increase in heart rate caused by arbutamine is thought to limit regional subendocardial perfusion, thereby limiting tissue oxygenation. In functional assays, arbutamine is more selective for beta-adrenergic receptors than for alpha-adrenergic receptors. The beta-agonist activity of arbutamine provides cardiac stress by increasing heart rate, cardiac contractility, and systolic blood pressure. The degree of hypotension that occurs for a given chronotropic activity is less with arbutamine than, for example, with isoproterenol because alpha receptor activity is retained."
734,"Sertraline is indicated for the management of major depressive disorder (MDD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder (PD), premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), and social anxiety disorder (SAD).[L9016] Common off-label uses for sertraline include the prevention of post stroke depression[A187078], generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), fibromyalgia, premature ejaculation, migraine prophylaxis, diabetic neuropathy, and neurocardiogenic syncope.[L5227]  Sertraline is a popular antidepressant medication commonly known as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and is similar to drugs such as [Citalopram] and [Fluoxetine]. Despite marked structural differences between compounds in this drug class, SSRIs exert similar pharmacological effects.    Several weeks of therapy with sertraline may be required before beneficial effects are noticed. Sertraline displays enhanced safety or tolerability than other classes of antidepressants, which frequently cause high levels of drowsiness, dizziness, blurred vision, and other undesirable effects.[A1846,A187075,T28]Sertraline improves or relieves the symptoms of depression, OCD, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder via the inhibition of serotonin reuptake.[A187075,L9016] Clinical studies have shown that it improves cognition in depressed patients.[A1846] It has less sedative, anticholinergic, and cardiovascular effects than the tricyclic antidepressant drugs because it does not exert significant anticholinergic, antihistamine, or adrenergic (alpha1, alpha2, beta) blocking activity.[A1844] The onset of action and beneficial effects are usually noticed after 4-6 weeks, for reasons that are not fully understood and currently under investigation.[A188493,L10677]Sertraline selectively inhibits the reuptake of serotonin (5-HT) at the presynaptic neuronal membrane, thereby increasing serotonergic activity. This results in an increased synaptic concentration of serotonin in the CNS, which leads to numerous functional changes associated with enhanced serotonergic neurotransmission.[T28,L9016] These changes are believed to be responsible for the antidepressant action and beneficial effects in obsessive-compulsive (and other anxiety related disorders). It has been hypothesized that obsessive-compulsive disorder, like depression, is also caused by the disregulation of serotonin.[A187165]    In animal studies, chronic administration of sertraline results in down-regulation of brain norepinephrine receptors.[L9016] Sertraline displays affinity for sigma-1 and 2 receptor binding sites[A31941], but binds with stronger affinity to sigma-1 binding sites.[A31940] In vitro, sertraline shows little to no affinity for GABA, dopaminergic, serotonergic (5HT1A, 5HT1B, 5HT2), or benzodiazepine receptors.[L9016] It exerts weak inhibitory actions on the neuronal uptake of norepinephrine and dopamine[A1844] and exhibits no inhibitory effects on the monoamine oxidase enzyme.[L9016]"
735,"For the treatment of obesity. Sibutramine (trade name Meridia in the USA, Reductil in Europe and other countries), usually as sibutramide hydrochloride monohydrate, is an orally administered agent for the treatment of obesity. It is a centrally acting stimulant chemically related to amphetamines thus it is classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance in the United States. In October 2010, Sibutramine was withdrawn from Canadian and U.S. markets due to concerns that the drug increases the risk of heart attack and stroke in patients with a history of heart disease. Sibutramine is an orally administered agent for the treatment of obesity. Sibutramine exerts its pharmacological actions predominantly via its secondary (M1) and primary (M2) amine metabolites. The parent compound, sibutramine, is a potent inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake in vivo, but not in vitro. However, metabolites M1 and M2 inhibit the reuptake of these neurotransmitters both in vitro and in vivo. In human brain tissue, M1 and M2 also inhibit dopamine reuptake in vitro, but with ~3-fold lower potency than for the reuptake inhibition of serotonin or norepinephrine. Sibutramine, M1 and M2 exhibit no evidence of anticholinergic or antihistaminergic actions. In addition, receptor binding profiles show that sibutramine, M1 and M2 have low affinity for serotonin (5-HT1, 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C), norepinephrine (b, b1, b3, a1 and a2), dopamine (D1 and D2), benzodiazepine, and glutamate (NMDA) receptors. These compounds also lack monoamine oxidase inhibitory activity in vitro and in vivo. Sibutramine produces its therapeutic effects by inhibition of norepinephrine (NE), serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), and to a lesser extent, dopamine reuptake at the neuronal synapse. By inhibiting the reuptake of these neurotransmitters, sibutramine promotes a sense of satiety and decrease in appetite, thereby reducing food intake. Data from animal studies also suggest that sibutramine may also increase energy expenditure through thermogenic effects in both the basal and fed states, but this has not been confirmed in humans. Sibutramine and its major pharmacologically active metabolites (M1 and M2) do not act via release of monoamines."
736,"As an ophthalmic for the temporary relief of the signs and symptoms of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis. Also used as a nasal spray for allergic rhinitis.Levocabastine is a selective second-generation H1-receptor antagonist used for allergic conjunctivitis. Levocabastine was discovered at Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1979.Levocabastine is a selective histamine H1-receptor antagonist exerting inhibitory effects on the release of chemical mediators from mast cells and on the chemotaxis of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and eosinophils. Both histamine and antigens induced conjunctivitis can be inhibited by levocabastine. Levocabastine can also reduce symptoms of allergic rhinitis by preventing an increase in vascular permeability of nasal mucosa.Levocabastine is a potent, selective histamine H1-receptor antagonist. It works by competing with histamine for H1-receptor sites on effector cells. It thereby prevents, but does not reverse, responses mediated by histamine alone. Levocabastine does not block histamine release but, rather, prevents histamine binding and activity. Levocabastine also binds neurotensin 2 receptors and serves as a neurotensin agonist. This can induce some degree of analgesia."
737,"For the treatment of insomnia.Methyprylon is a sedative of the piperidinedione derivative family that was previously used for the treatment of insomnia. However, with the introduction of newer drugs with fewer side effects, such as benzodiazepines, the clinical use of methyprylon is now limited. Methyprylon was withdrawn from the U.S. market in June 1965 and the Canadian market in September 1990 due to adverse events.Methyprylon, a piperidinedione CNS depressant, is close to barbituric acid in structure, but different enough to be called a ""non-barbiturate"" sedative-hynotic. Methyprylon is used for insomnia and daytime tension. Methyprylon depresses the activity of muscle tissues, the heart, and the respiratory system.Methyprylon binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl- ionopore at the GABAA receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl- ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged."
738,"Used in the treatment of Cushing's syndrome. It is normally used in short-term treatment until permanent therapy is possible.Trilostane is an inhibitor of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase used in the treatment of Cushing's syndrome. It was withdrawn from the United States market in April 1994.Trilostane blocks an enzyme involved in the production of several steroids including cortisol. Inhibiting this enzyme inhibits the production of cortisol. In Cushing's syndrome, the adrenal gland overproduces steroids. Although steroids are important for various functions of the body, too much can cause problems. Trilostane reduces the amount of steroids produced by the adrenal gland. This product was withdrawn from the U.S. market in April 1994.Trilostane produces suppression of the adrenal cortex by inhibiting enzymatic conversion of steroids by 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/delta 5,4 ketosteroid isomerase, thus blocking synthesis of adrenal steroids."
739,"Miconazole is indicated for the local treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis in adult patients and for the adjunctive treatment of diaper dermatitis complicated by candidiasis in immunocompetent patients aged four weeks and older.[L14021, L14024] Miconazole is available as both a suppository and cream for the treatment of vaginal yeast infections and the relief of associated vulvar itching and irritation.[L14027] Lastly, miconazole cream is effective in treating athlete's foot (tinea pedis), jock itch (tinea cruris), ringworm infections (tinea corporis),[L14033] pityriasis (formerly tinea) versicolor,[A203633] and cutaneous candidiasis.[A203630]Miconazole is a broad-spectrum azole antifungal with some activity against Gram-positive bacteria as well.[A203636] It is widely used to treat mucosal yeast infections, including both oral and vaginal infections; although intravenous miconazole is no longer available, a wide variety of suppositories, creams, gels, and tablet-based products are available.[L14021, L14024, L14027, L14033, L14396] Miconazole is thought to act primarily through the inhibition of fungal CYP450 14α-lanosterol demethylase activity.[A203636, A203639]    Miconazole was first synthesized in 1969 and first granted FDA approval on January 8, 1974, for sale by INSIGHT Pharmaceuticals as a topical cream.[A214523, L14021] It is currently available as a variety of prescription and over the counter products. Despite having been in clinical use for an extended period, resistance to miconazole among susceptible organisms is relatively low.[A203636]Miconazole is an azole antifungal that functions primarily through inhibition of a specific demethylase within the CYP450 complex.[A203636] As miconazole is typically applied topically and is minimally absorbed into the systemic circulation following application, the majority of patient reactions are limited to hypersensitivity and cases of anaphylaxis.[L14021] Patients using intravaginal miconazole products are advised not to rely on contraceptives to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, as well as not to use tampons concurrently.[L14027]Miconazole is an azole antifungal used to treat a variety of conditions, including those caused by _Candida_ overgrowth. Unique among the azoles, miconazole is thought to act through three main mechanisms.[A203636] The primary mechanism of action is through inhibition of the CYP450 14α-lanosterol demethylase enzyme, which results in altered ergosterol production and impaired cell membrane composition and permeability, which in turn leads to cation, phosphate, and low molecular weight protein leakage.[A203636, A203639]    In addition, miconazole inhibits fungal peroxidase and catalase while not affecting NADH oxidase activity, leading to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).[A203636, A203639, A203642] Increased intracellular ROS leads to downstream pleiotropic effects and eventual apoptosis.[A203636]    Lastly, likely as a result of lanosterol demethylation inhibition, miconazole causes a rise in intracellular levels of farnesol. This molecule participates in quorum sensing in _Candida_, preventing the transition from yeast to mycelial forms and thereby the formation of biofilms, which are more resistant to antibiotics.[A203645, A203648] In addition, farnesol is an inhibitor of drug efflux ABC transporters, namely _Candida_ CaCdr1p and CaCdr2p, which may additionally contribute to increased effectiveness of azole drugs.[A203648]"
740,"For the treatment of many different types of bacterial infections such as bronchitis, sinusitis, tonsillitis, ear infections, skin infections, gonorrhea, and urinary tract infections. Broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic resistant to beta-lactamase. It has been proposed for infections with gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, gonorrhea, and haemophilus. Cefuroxime is a β-lactam type antibiotic. More specifically, it is a second-generation cephalosporin. Cephalosporins work the same way as penicillins: they interfere with the peptidoglycan synthesis of the bacterial wall by inhibiting the final transpeptidation needed for the cross-links. This effect is bactericidal. Cefuroxime is effective against the following organisms: Aerobic Gram-positive Microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes. Aerobic Gram-negative Microorganisms: Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase-producing strains), Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis (including beta-lactamase-producing strains), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (including beta-lactamase-producing strains). Spirochetes: Borrelia burgdorferi. Cefuroxime axetil is the prodrug Cefuroxime, like the penicillins, is a beta-lactam antibiotic. By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, it inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that cefuroxime interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."
741,"For the treatment of impotence and vasospasms.An alkaloid found in opium but not closely related to the other opium alkaloids in its structure or pharmacological actions. It is a direct-acting smooth muscle relaxant used in the treatment of impotence and as a vasodilator, especially for cerebral vasodilation. The mechanism of its pharmacological actions is not clear, but it apparently can inhibit phosphodiesterases and it may have direct actions on calcium channels.Papaverine is a nonxanthine phosphodiesterase inhibitor for the relief of cerebral and peripheral ischemia associated with arterial spasm and myocardial ischemia complicated by arrhythmias. The main actions of Papaverine are exerted on cardiac and smooth muscle. Like qathidine, Papaverine acts directly on the heart muscle to depress conduction and prolong the refractory period. Papaverine relaxes various smooth muscles. This relaxation may be prominent if spasm exists. The muscle cell is not paralyzed by Papaverine and still responds to drugs and other stimuli causing contraction. The antispasmodic effect is a direct one, and unrelated to muscle innervation. Papaverine is practically devoid of effects on the central nervous system. Papaverine relaxes the smooth musculature of the larger blood vessels, especially coronary, systemic peripheral, and pulmonary arteries.Perhaps by its direct vasodilating action on cerebral blood vessels, Papaverine increases cerebral blood flow and decreases cerebral vascular resistance in normal subjects; oxygen consumption is unaltered. These effects may explain the benefit reported from the drug in cerebral vascular encephalopathy."
742,"For the treatment of rhinitis, urticaria, allergy, common cold, asthma and hay fever.A histamine H1 antagonist used in allergic reactions, hay fever, rhinitis, urticaria, and asthma. It has also been used in veterinary applications. One of the most widely used of the classical antihistaminics, it generally causes less drowsiness and sedation than promethazine.In allergic reactions an allergen interacts with and cross-links surface IgE antibodies on mast cells and basophils. Once the mast cell-antibody-antigen complex is formed, a complex series of events occurs that eventually leads to cell-degranulation and the release of histamine (and other chemical mediators) from the mast cell or basophil. Once released, histamine can react with local or widespread tissues through histamine receptors. Histamine, acting on H1-receptors, produces pruritis, vasodilatation, hypotension, flushing, headache, tachycardia, and bronchoconstriction. Histamine also increases vascular permeability and potentiates pain. Chlorpheniramine, is a histamine H1 antagonist (or more correctly, an inverse histamine agonist) of the alkylamine class. It competes with histamine for the normal H1-receptor sites on effector cells of the gastrointestinal tract, blood vessels and respiratory tract. It provides effective, temporary relief of sneezing, watery and itchy eyes, and runny nose due to hay fever and other upper respiratory allergies.Chlorpheniramine binds to the histamine H1 receptor. This blocks the action of endogenous histamine, which subsequently leads to temporary relief of the negative symptoms brought on by histamine."
743,"Nifedipine capsules are indicated to treat vasospastic angina and chronic stable angina.[L11383] Extended release tablets are indicated to treat vasospastic angina, chronic stable angina, and hypertension.[L11389,L1245]Nifedipine, or BAY a 1040, is a first generation dihydropyridine L-type calcium channel blocker, similar to [nicardipine].[A190210,A190273,A175390,L11383] Nifedipine was developed by Bayer and first described in the literature, along with other dihydropyridines, in 1972.[A175390,A190276] Since nifedipine's development, second and third generation dihydropyridines have been developed with slower onsets and longer durations of action.[A190273] The most popular of the third generation dihydropyridines is [amlodipine].[A190273]    Nifedipine was granted FDA approval on 31 December 1981.[L11383]Nifedipine is an inhibitor of L-type voltage gated calcium channels that reduces blood pressure and increases oxygen supply to the heart.[A190204] Immediate release nifedipine's duration of action requires dosing 3 times daily.[L11383] Nifedipine dosing is generally 10-120mg daily.[L11383] Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of excessive hypotension, angina, and myocardial infarction.[L11383]Nifedipine blocks voltage gated L-type calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle and myocardial cells.[A190204] This blockage prevents the entry of calcium ions into cells during depolarization, reducing peripheral arterial vascular resistance and dilating coronary arteries.[A190204] These actions reduce blood pressure and increase the supply of oxygen to the heart, alleviating angina.[A190204]"
744,"For the treatment or prevention of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in patients who are intolerant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). Also indicated for the acute oral treatment of mild to moderate PCP in patients who are intolerant to TMP-SMX. Atovaquone is a hydroxynaphthoquinone, or an analog of ubiquinone, that has antimicrobial and antipneumocystis activity. It is being used in antimalarial protocols. Atovaquone is a highly lipophilic drug that closely resembles the structure ubiquinone. Its inhibitory effect being comparable to ubiquinone, atovaquone can act by selectively affecting mitochondrial electron transport and parallel processes such as ATP and pyrimidine biosynthesis in atovaquone-responsive parasites. Cytochrome bc1 complex (complex III) seems to serve as a highly discriminating molecular target for atovaquone in Plasmodia. There is no significant risk for myelosuppression associated with atovaquone, making this drug a beneficial therapeutic agent for recipients of bone marrow transplantation. The mechanism of action against Pneumocystis carinii has not been fully elucidated. In Plasmodium species, the site of action appears to be the cytochrome bc1 complex (Complex III). Several metabolic enzymes are linked to the mitochondrial electron transport chain via ubiquinone. Inhibition of electron transport by atovaquone will result in indirect inhibition of these enzymes. The ultimate metabolic effects of such blockade may include inhibition of nucleic acid and ATP synthesis. Atovaquone also has been shown to have good in vitro activity against Toxoplasma gondii."
745,"The FDA approved indications for amiodarone are recurrent ventricular fibrillation (VF) and recurrent hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia (VT). The FDA emphasizes that this drug should only be given in these conditions when they are clinically documented and have not responded to normal therapeutic doses of other antiarrhythmic agents, or when other drugs are not tolerated by the patient.[L3561]    Off-label indications include atrial fibrillation and supraventricular tachycardia.[A189666,A189720,A189723,L11286]Amiodarone is a benzofuran derivative, anti-arrhythmic drug used commonly in a variety of settings.[A36817] Most known for its approved indication in life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, it is also used off-label in the outpatient and inpatient setting for atrial fibrillation. Because of its ability to cause serious toxicity and possibly death, amiodarone use should be reserved for its approved indications, according to prescribing information.[L3561,L11265,L11286]After intravenous administration, amiodarone acts to relax smooth muscles that line vascular walls, decreases peripheral vascular resistance (afterload), and increases the cardiac index by a small amount. Administration by this route also decreases cardiac conduction, preventing and treating arrhythmias.[A1901,A189666,L3561] When it is given orally, however, amiodarone does not lead to significant changes in the left ventricular ejection fraction. Similar to other anti-arrhythmic agents, controlled clinical trials do not confirm that oral amiodarone increases survival.[L3561]     Amiodarone prolongs the QRS duration and QT interval.  In addition, a decreased SA (sinoatrial) node automaticity occurs with a decrease in AV node conduction velocity. Ectopic pacemaker automaticity is also inhibited.[L11265] Thyrotoxicosis or hypothyroidism may also result from the administration of amiodarone, which contains high levels of iodine, and interferes with normal thyroid function.[A182168]Amiodarone is considered a class III anti-arrhythmic drug. It blocks potassium currents that cause repolarization of the heart muscle during the third phase of the cardiac action potential. As a result amiodarone increases the duration of the action potential as well as the effective refractory period for cardiac cells (myocytes). Therefore, cardiac muscle cell excitability is reduced, preventing and treating abnormal heart rhythms.[A183137,A189747]    Unique from other members of the class III anti-arrhythmic drug class, amiodarone also interferes with the functioning of beta-adrenergic receptors, sodium channels, and calcium channels channels. These actions, at times, can lead to undesirable effects, such as hypotension, bradycardia, and Torsades de pointes (TdP).[L11265] In addition to the above, amiodarone may increase activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, leading to steatogenic changes in the liver or other organs.[A20227,A20650] Finally, amiodarone has been found to bind to the thyroid receptor due to its iodine content, potentially leading to amiodarone induced hypothyroidism or thyrotoxicosis.[A182168]"
746,"Oral diazoxide is indicated to manage hypoglycemia due to hyperinsulinism associated with conditions such as inoperable islet cell adenoma or carcinoma, and extrapancreatic malignancy in adults, or leucine sensitivity, islet cell hyperplasia, nesidioblastosis, extrapancreatic malignancy, islet cell adenoma, and adenomatosis in infants and children. In infants and children oral diazoxide may be used preoperatively as a temporary measure, and postoperatively, if hypoglycemia persists.[L44612] Diazoxide may also be used parentally or intravenously to treat hypertensive emergencies.[A255632,L44622]Diazoxide is a non-diuretic benzothiadiazine derivative that activates ATP-sensitive potassium channels.[A255647,L44612] It is chemically related to thiazide diuretics but does not inhibit carbonic anhydrase and does not have chloriuretic or natriuretic activity.[A190372] Diazoxide is commonly used in the treatment of hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycemia due to its ability to inhibit insulin release.[A255647] Diazoxide also exhibits hypotensive activity and reduces arteriolar smooth muscle and vascular resistance.[A190372] When administered intravenously, diazoxide can be used to treat hypertensive emergencies;[L44622] however, this specific form of diazoxide is no longer available in the US. Diazoxide is usually well tolerated, and some of its more common side effects include fluid retention and electrolyte disturbances. In September 2015, the FDA issued a safety alert regarding post-marketing reports of pulmonary hypertension occurring in infants and neonates.[A255647,L44612]Diazoxide is a potassium channel activator that enhances cell membrane permeability to potassium ions. By promoting a vasodilatory effect on the smooth muscle in peripheral arterioles, diazoxide lowers blood pressure and peripheral vascular resistance. Diazoxide-induced decreases in blood pressure lead to reflex increases in heart rate and cardiac output.[L44622] The oral administration of diazoxide increases blood glucose in a dose-dependent manner. In patients with normal renal function, this effect is observed within an hour and lasts no more than eight hours. The hypotensive effects of diazoxide are usually not detected when administered orally.[L44612]    Diazoxide administered intravenously may lead to sodium and water retention, severe hypotension, transient myocardial or cerebral ischaemia and gastrointestinal upsets such as nausea, vomiting and abdominal discomfort.[L44622] Diazoxide administered orally may cause ketoacidosis and nonketotic hyperosmolar coma, especially in patients with other concurrent conditions.[L44612] The use of intravenous or oral diazoxide may lead to the development of pulmonary hypertension in infants and neonates.[L44612,L44622]Diazoxide is a nondiuretic benzothiadiazine derivative used for the management of symptomatic hypoglycemia. By binding to the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) subunit of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel (K<sub>ATP</sub>) channel on the membrane of pancreatic beta‐cells, diazoxide promotes a potassium efflux from beta-cells. This hyperpolarizes the cell membrane and prevents the influx of calcium to the pancreatic beta‐cells. Without a sufficient amount of calcium in the cell, insulin release is inhibited.[A255647] Therefore, the use of diazoxide produces an increase in glucose levels.[L44612] Diazoxide is chemically related to thiazide diuretics but does not inhibit carbonic anhydrase and does not have chloriuretic or natriuretic activity.[A190372] It also exhibits hypotensive activity by reducing arteriolar smooth muscle and vascular resistance.[A190372] The mechanism of action of its hypotensive effect has not been fully elucidated; however, it is possible that it involves the antagonism of calcium.[L44622]"
747,"For the treatment of NIDDM in conjunction with diet and exercise. Gliclazide is an oral antihyperglycemic agent used for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It has been classified differently according to its drug properties in which based on its chemical structure, gliclazide is considered a first-generation sulfonylurea due to the structural presence of a sulfonamide group able to release a proton and the presence of one aromatic group.[A39546] On the other hand, based on the pharmacological efficacy, gliclazide is considered a second-generation sulfonylurea which presents a higher potency and a shorter half-life.[T238, T360] Gliclazide belongs to the sulfonylurea class of insulin secretagogues, which act by stimulating &beta; cells of the pancreas to release insulin. Sulfonylureas increase both basal insulin secretion and meal-stimulated insulin release. Medications in this class differ in their dose, rate of absorption, duration of action, route of elimination and binding site on their target pancreatic &beta; cell receptor. Sulfonylureas also increase peripheral glucose utilization, decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis and may increase the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors. Sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain, though less so than insulin. Due to their mechanism of action, sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia and require consistent food intake to decrease this risk. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased in elderly, debilitated and malnourished individuals. Gliclazide has been shown to decrease fasting plasma glucose, postprandial blood glucose and glycosolated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels (reflective of the last 8-10 weeks of glucose control). Gliclazide is extensively metabolized by the liver; its metabolites are excreted in both urine (60-70%) and feces (10-20%).Based on the pharmacological properties, gliclazide is a second generation sulphonylurea which acts as a hypoglycemic agent. It stimulates &beta; cells of the islet of Langerhans in the pancreas to release insulin. It also enhances peripheral insulin sensitivity. Overall, it potentiates insulin release and improves insulin dynamics.Gliclazide binds to the &beta; cell sulfonyl urea receptor (SUR1). This binding subsequently blocks the ATP sensitive potassium channels. The binding results in closure of the channels and leads to a resulting decrease in potassium efflux leads to depolarization of the &beta; cells. This opens voltage-dependent calcium channels in the &beta; cell resulting in calmodulin activation, which in turn leads to exocytosis of insulin containing secretorty granules."
748,"Used to control certain seizures in the treatment of epilepsy.Phenacemide is used to control certain seizures in the treatment of epilepsy. This medicine acts on the central nervous system (CNS) to reduce the number and severity of seizures.Phenacemide is a ureal anticonvulsant indicated for control of severe epilepsy, particularly mixed forms of complex partial (psychomotor or temporal lobe) seizures, refractory to other anticonvulsants. Phenacemide elevates the threshold for minimal electroshock convulsions and abolishes the tonic phase of maximal electroshock seizures. It also prevents or modifies seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol or other convulsants.Phenacemide binds to and blocks neuronal sodium channels or voltage sensitive calcium channels. This blocks or suppresses neuronal depolarization and hypersynchronization. Hypersynchronization is what often causes seizures."
749,"For treatment of NIDDM (non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) in conjunction with diet and exercise.Tolbutamide is an oral antihyperglycemic agent used for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It is structurally similar to acetohexamide, chlorpropamide and tolazamide and belongs to the sulfonylurea class of insulin secretagogues, which act by stimulating β cells of the pancreas to release insulin. Sulfonylureas increase both basal insulin secretion and meal-stimulated insulin release. Medications in this class differ in their dose, rate of absorption, duration of action, route of elimination and binding site on their target pancreatic β cell receptor. Sulfonylureas also increase peripheral glucose utilization, decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis and may increase the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors. Sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain, though less so than insulin. Due to their mechanism of action, sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia and require consistent food intake to decrease this risk. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased in elderly, debilitated and malnourished individuals. Tolbutamide appears to be metabolized in the liver. Tolbutamide and its metabolites are excreted in urine (75-85%) and feces.Tolbutamide, a first-generation sulfonylurea antidiabetic agent, is used with diet to lower blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes mellitus type II. Tolbutamide is twice as potent as the related second-generation agent glipizide. Tolbutamide lowers blood sugar by stimulating the pancreas to secrete insulin and helping the body use insulin efficiently. The pancreas must be able to produce insulin for this drug to work.Sulfonylureas lower blood glucose in patients with NIDDM by directly stimulating the acute release of insulin from functioning beta cells of pancreatic islet tissue by an unknown process that involves a sulfonylurea receptor (receptor 1) on the beta cell. Sulfonylureas inhibit the ATP-potassium channels on the beta cell membrane and potassium efflux, which results in depolarization and calcium influx, calcium-calmodulin binding, kinase activation, and release of insulin-containing granules by exocytosis, an effect similar to that of glucose."
750,"For the prophylaxis and treatment of venous thrombosis and its extension, the treatment of atrial fibrillation with embolization, the prophylaxis and treatment of pulmonary embolism, and as an adjunct in the treatment of coronary occlusion.Anisindione is a synthetic anticoagulant and an indanedione derivative. Its anticoagulant action is mediated through the inhibition of the vitamin K-mediated gamma-carboxylation of precursor proteins that are critical in forming the formation of active procoagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X, as well as the anticoagulant proteins C and S, in the liver.Anisindione is a synthetic anticoagulant and an indanedione derivative. It is prescribed only if you cannot take coumarin-type anticoagulants such as coumadin as anisindione is a powerful drug with serious potential side effects. Anticoagulants decrease the clotting ability of the blood and therefore help to prevent harmful clots from forming in the blood vessels. These medicines are sometimes called blood thinners, although they do not actually thin the blood. They also will not dissolve clots that already have formed, but they may prevent the clots from becoming larger and causing more serious problems.Like phenindione, to which it is related chemically, anisindione exercises its therapeutic action by reducing the prothrombin activity of the blood. By inhibiting the vitamin ;mediated gamma-carboxylation of precursor proteins, the formation of active procoagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X, as well as the anticoagulant proteins C and S is prevented. Anisindione has no direct thrombolytic effect and does not reverse ischemic tissue damage, although it may limit extension of existing thrombi and prevent secondary thromboembolic complications."
751,"Indicated for the treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men with an enlarged prostate gland to improve symptoms, and reduce the risk of acute urinary retention and the need for BPH-related surgery alone or in combination with [tamsulosin].[L10568]Dutasteride is an oral synthetic 4-azasteroid commonly marketed under the trade name Avodart. It is a novel dual 5α-reductase inhibitor that works by blocking both isoforms of 5α-reductase enzymes in a potent, selective, and irreversible manner.[A1909] Type I and II 5α-reductase enzymes convert testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a primary hormonal mediator that plays a role in the development and enlargement of the prostate gland. Dutasteride was approved by the FDA in 2001 for the treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men as monotherapy or in combination with the α-adrenergic antagonist [tamsulosin] to enhance the therapeutic response. Its clinical efficacy against benign prostate hyperplasia in male patients is comparable to that of [finasteride], a specific type II 5α-reductase inhibitor. However, unlike finasteride, dutasteride is not yet indicated for the treatment of androgenic alopecia although it was demonstrated to be effective in several randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in androgenetic alopecia.[A178333,A178336]Dutasteride is a synthetic 4-azasteroid compound that selectively inhibits both the type I and type II isoforms of steroid 5α-reductase, an intracellular enzyme that converts testosterone to 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Dutasteride works by reducing the levels of circulating DHT. It was also shown to reduce the size of the prostate gland, improve urinary flow, and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia alone or in combination with tamsulosin.[L6256] The effect of the reduction of DHT by dutasteride is dose-dependent, with the maximum effect observed within 1-2 weeks following initial administration.[L10568]     After 1 and 2 weeks of daily dosing with dutasteride 0.5 mg, median serum DHT concentrations were reduced by 85% and 90%, respectively.[L10568] The serum concentrations of DHT were maintained to be decreased by more than 90% in 85% of patients following 1 years' administration of oral dutasteride 0.5 mg/day.[A178345] As evident from the clinical studies, dutasteride may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer.[L10568] The 5α-reductase is a nuclear-bound steroid intracellular enzyme primarily located in the prostatic stromal cell that converts the androgen testosterone into the more active metabolite, 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT).[A2132] DHT is considered to be the primary androgen playing a role in the initial development and subsequent enlargement of the prostate gland. It serves as the hormonal mediator for the hyperplasia upon accumulation within the prostate gland.[A178270] DHT displays a higher affinity towards androgen receptors in the prostate gland compared to testosterone[T28] and by acting on the androgen receptors, DHT modulates genes that are responsible for cell proliferation.[A178279] Responsible for the synthesis of approximately one-third of circulating DHT, type I 5α-reductase is predominant in the sebaceous glands of most regions of skin, including the scalp, and liver. The type II 5a-reductase isozyme is primarily found in the prostate, seminal vesicles, epididymides, and hair follicles as well as liver, and is responsible for two-thirds of circulating DHT.[L10568] Due to its dual inhibition of both isoenzymes of 5α-reductase, dutasteride causes a near-complete suppression of DHT.[A178348] Compared to a 70% reduction of serum DHT levels caused by [finasteride], a near-complete suppression of serum DHT-more than 90% is seen with dutasteride.[A178378]    By forming a stable complex with both type II and type II 5α-reductase, dutasteride inhibits its enzymatic action of converting testosterone to 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is the androgen primarily responsible for the initial development and subsequent enlargement of the prostate gland. It is proposed that DHT is the principal androgen responsible for prostatic growth in later life-normal masculinization of the external genitalia and maturation of the prostate gland during development-thus reducing the serum DHT levels results in reduced prostatic volume and increased epithelial apoptosis.[A178375] Dutasteride is a competitive and specific inhibitor of both Type I and Type II 5α-reductase isoenzymes and when evaluated under _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ conditions, the dissociation of the drug from the drug-enzyme complex is reported to be extremely slow.[L10568] Dutasteride does not bind to the human androgen receptor.[L10568]"

A broad spectrum antimycotic with some action against Gram positive bacteria. It is used topically in dermatomycoses also orally and parenterally. Econazole is an antifungal medication related to fluconazole (Diflucan), ketoconazole (Nizoral), itraconazole (Sporanox), and clotrimazole (Lotrimin, Mycelex). Econazole prevents fungal organisms from producing vital substances required for growth and function. This medication is effective only for infections caused by fungal organisms. It will not work for bacterial or viral infections. Econazole interacts with 14-alpha demethylase, a cytochrome P-450 enzyme necessary to convert lanosterol to ergosterol. As ergosterol is an essential component of the fungal cell membrane, inhibition of its synthesis results in increased cellular permeability causing leakage of cellular contents. Econazole may also inhibit endogenous respiration, interact with membrane phospholipids, inhibit the transformation of yeasts to mycelial forms, inhibit purine uptake, and impair triglyceride and/or phospholipid biosynthesis."
753,"Bicalutamide is indicated in combination with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist for the treatment of Stage D2 metastatic carcinoma of the prostate.[L40478]Bicalutamide is an oral non-steroidal anti-androgen for prostate cancer. It is comprised of a racemic mixture that is a 50:50 composition of the (R)-bicalutamide and (S)-bicalutamide enantionmers. Bicalutamide binds to the androgen receptor.Bicalutamide is an antineoplastic hormonal agent primarily used in the treatment of prostate cancer. Bicalutamide is a pure, nonsteroidal anti-androgen with affinity for androgen receptors (but not for progestogen, estrogen, or glucocorticoid receptors). Consequently, Bicalutamide blocks the action of androgens of adrenal and testicular origin which stimulate the growth of normal and malignant prostatic tissue. Prostate cancer is mostly androgen-dependent and can be treated with surgical or chemical castration. To date, antiandrogen monotherapy has not consistently been shown to be equivalent to castration.Bicalutamide competes with androgen for the binding of androgen receptors, consequently blocking the action of androgens of adrenal and testicular origin which stimulate the growth of normal and malignant prostatic tissue."
754,"For the treatment of acid-reflux disorders (GERD), peptic ulcer disease, H. pylori eradication, and prevention of gastrointestinal bleeds with NSAID use. Rabeprazole is an antiulcer drug in the class of proton pump inhibitors. It is a prodrug - in the acid environment of the parietal cells it turns into active sulphenamide form. Rabeprazole inhibits the H+, K+ATPase of the coating gastric cells and dose-dependent oppresses basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion. Rabeprazole prevents the production of acid in the stomach. It reduces symptoms and prevents injury to the esophagus or stomach in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or ulcers. Rabeprazole is also useful in conditions that produce too much stomach acid such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Rabeprazole may also be used with antibiotics to get rid of bacteria that are associated with some ulcers. Rabeprazole is a selective and irreversible proton pump inhibitor, suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+, K+ -ATPase, which is found at the secretory surface of parietal cells. In doing so, it inhibits the final transport of hydrogen ions (via exchange with potassium ions) into the gastric lumen. Rabeprazole belongs to a class of antisecretory compounds (substituted benzimidazole proton-pump inhibitors) that do not exhibit anticholinergic or histamine H2-receptor antagonist properties, but suppress gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the gastric H+/K+ATPase (hydrogen-potassium adenosine triphosphatase) at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, rabeprazole has been characterized as a gastric proton-pump inhibitor. Rabeprazole blocks the final step of gastric acid secretion. In gastric parietal cells, rabeprazole is protonated, accumulates, and is transformed to an active sulfenamide. When studied in vitro, rabeprazole is chemically activated at pH 1.2 with a half-life of 78 seconds."
755,"Pioglitazone is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.[L11416] It is also available in combination with [metformin],[L11419] [glimepiride],[L11422] or [alogliptin][L11425] for the same indication.Pioglitazone is an antihyperglycemic used as an adjunct to diet, exercise, and other antidiabetic medications to manage type 2 diabetes mellitus.[L11416,L11419,L11422,L11425] It is administered as a racemic mixture, though there is no pharmacologic difference between the enantiomers and they appear to interconvert _in vivo_ with little consequence.[L11416] The thiazolidinedione class of medications, which also includes [rosiglitazone] and [troglitazone], exerts its pharmacological effect primarily by promoting insulin sensitivity and the improved uptake of blood glucose[L11416] via agonism at the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ).[A19757] PPARs are ligand-activated transcription factors that are involved in the expression of more than 100 genes and affect numerous metabolic processes, most notably lipid and glucose homeostasis.[A19759]    Thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone, have fallen out of favor in recent years due to the presence of multiple adverse effects and warnings regarding their use (e.g. congestive heart failure, bladder cancer) and the availability of safer and more effective alternatives for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.[L11461]Pioglitazone enhances cellular responsiveness to insulin, increases insulin-dependent glucose disposal, and improves impaired glucose homeostasis.[A19757] In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, these effects result in lower plasma glucose concentrations, lower plasma insulin concentrations, and lower HbA1c values.[A19757]     Significant fluid retention leading to the development/exacerbation of congestive heart failure has been reported with pioglitazone - avoid its use in patients in heart failure or at risk of developing heart failure.[L11416] There is some evidence that pioglitazone may be associated with an increased risk of developing bladder cancer. Pioglitazone should not be used in patients with active bladder cancer and should be used with caution in patients with a history of bladder cancer.[L11416]Pioglitazone is a selective agonist at peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) in target tissues for insulin action such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver.[L11416,A19759] Activation of PPARγ increases the transcription of insulin-responsive genes involved in the control of glucose and lipid production, transport, and utilization.[A19759] Through this mechanism, pioglitazone both enhances tissue sensitivity to insulin and reduces the hepatic production of glucose (i.e. gluconeogenesis) - insulin resistance associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus is therefore improved without an increase in insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells.[L11416,A19759]"
756,"Used to provide skeletal muscle relaxation as an adjunct to general anesthesia, for endotracheal intubation or to facilitate mechanical ventilation.Doxacurium chloride is a long-acting, nondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxant for intravenous administration.Doxacurium chloride is a long-acting, nondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxant. The neuromuscular block produced by doxacurium chloride may be antagonized by anticholinesterase agents. As with other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents, the more profound the neuromuscular block at reversal, the longer the time and the greater the dose of anticholinesterase required for recovery of neuromuscular function. Doxacurium chloride is approximately 2.5 to 3 times more potent than pancuronium and 10 to 12 times more potent than metocurine.Doxacurium chloride binds competitively to cholinergic receptors on the motor end-plate to antagonize the action of acetylcholine, resulting in a block of neuromuscular transmission (non-depolarizing). This action is antagonized by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as neostigmine."

758,"In oral and intravenous formulations, levofloxacin is indicated in adults for the treatment of various infections caused by susceptible bacteria, including infections of the upper respiratory tract, lower respiratory tract, skin, skin structures, urinary tract, and prostate.[L11638,L11692] The oral formulation is also indicated in both adults and children 6 months of age and older for the post-exposure management of inhalational anthrax caused by _Bacillus anthracis_ and for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of plague caused by _Yersinia pestis_.[L11638]    In its ophthalmic formulation, levofloxacin is indicated for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis caused by susceptible organisms.[L11641] An inhalational solution available in Canada is indicated for the management of cystic fibrosis patients aged 18 years or older with chronic pulmonary _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ infections.[L11689]Levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic and the optical S-(-) isomer of racemic [ofloxacin].[A190663] It reportedly carries 8 to 128-fold more activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria compared to R-(+)-ofloxacin[A190663] and remains stereochemically stable following administration (i.e. it does not invert to the inactive isomer).[L11638] Levofloxacin, along with other quinolones such as [gatifloxacin] and [moxifloxacin], is a member of the third generation of fluoroquinolones, colloquially referred to as the ""respiratory quinolones"" due to improved activity against gram-positive bacteria commonly implicated in respiratory infections.[A31453,A190756]    Levofloxacin was first approved by the FDA in 1996, and was approved in Canada and several South American countries soon after.[A190663]Levofloxacin is bactericidal and exerts its antimicrobial effects via inhibition of bacterial DNA replication.[L11638] It has a relatively long duration of action in comparison with other antibiotics that allows for once or twice daily dosing. Levofloxacin is associated with QTc-interval prolongation and should be used with caution in patients with other risk factors for prolongation (e.g. hypokalemia, concomitant medications).[L11638]    Levofloxacin has demonstrated _in vitro_ activity against a number of aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and may carry some activity against certain species of anaerobic bacteria[L11638] and other pathogens such as _Chlamydia_ and _Legionella_.[A190663] Resistance to levofloxacin may develop, and is generally due to mutations in DNA gyrase or topoisomerase IV, or via alterations to drug efflux.[L11638,A31453] Cross-resistance may occur between levofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones, but is unlikely to develop between levofloxacin and other antibiotic classes (e.g. macrolides) due to significant differences in chemical structure and mechanism of action.[L11638]    As antimicrobial susceptibility patterns are geographically distinct, local antibiograms should be consulted to ensure adequate coverage of relevant pathogens prior to use.Levofloxacin, like other fluoroquinolone antibiotics, exerts its antimicrobial activity via the inhibition of two key bacterial enzymes: DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV.[L11638] Both targets are type II topoisomerases, but have unique functions within the bacterial cell. DNA gyrase is an enzyme found only in bacteria that introduces negative supercoils into DNA during replication - this helps to relieve torsional strain caused by the introduction of positive supercoils during replication, and these negative supercoils are essential for chromosome condensation and the promotion of transcription initiation.[A31453] It is comprised of four subunits (two A subunits and two B subunits) of which the A subunits appear to be the target of fluoroquinolone antibiotics.[A190663] Bacterial topoisomerase IV, in addition to contributing to the relaxation of positive supercoils, is essential at the terminal stages of DNA replication and functions to “unlink” newly replicated chromosomes to allow for the completion of cell division.[A31453]    Inhibition of these enzymes by levofloxacin likely occurs via complexation with the topoisomerase enzymes.[A31453] The end result is a blockade of DNA replication, thus inhibiting cell division and resulting in cell death."
759,"For the treatment of gout and gouty arthritis.A uricosuric drug that is used to reduce the serum urate levels in gout therapy. It lacks anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and diuretic properties.Sulfinpyrazone's pharmacologic activity is the potentiation of the urinary excretion of uric acid. It is useful for reducing the blood urate levels in patients with chronic tophaceous gout and acute intermittent gout, and for promoting the resorption of tophi.Sulfinpyrazone is an oral uricosuric agent (pyrazolone derivative) used to treat chronic or intermittent gouty arthritis. Sulfinpyrazone competitively inhibits the reabsorption of uric acid at the proximal convoluted tubule, thereby facilitating urinary excretion of uric acid and decreasing plasma urate concentrations.  This is likely done through inhibition of the urate anion transporter (hURAT1) as well as the human organic anion transporter 4 (hOAT4). Sulfinpyrazone is not intended for the treatment of acute attacks because it lacks therapeutically useful analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. Sulfinpyrazone and its sulfide metabolite possess COX inhibitory effects. Sulfinpyrazone has also been shown to be a UDP-glucuronsyltransferase inhibitor and a very potent CYP2C9 inhibitor.  Sulfinpyrazone is also known to be a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) inhibitor as well as an inhibitor of several multridrug resistance proteins (MRPs).  "

Long-acting, broad-spectrum, water-soluble, cephalexin derivative. Cefadroxil, a first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic, is used to treat urinary tract infections, skin and skin structure infections, pharyngitis, and tonsillitis. Like all beta-lactam antibiotics, cefadroxil binds to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, causing the inhibition of the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that cefadroxil interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."
761,"Indicated for the treatment of candidemia, acute disseminated candidiasis, and certain other invasive Candida infections, as well as esophageal candidiasis, and prophylaxis of Candida infections in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Indicated for the prophylaxis of Candida infections in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Micafungin is an antifungal drug. It belongs to the antifungal class of compounds known as echinocandins and exerts its effect by inhibiting the synthesis of 1,3-beta-D-glucan, an integral component of the fungal cell wall. Formerly known as FK463, micafungin is a semisynthetic lipopeptide synthesized from a fermentation product of Coleophoma empetri that works as an antifungal agent. It is a glucan synthesis inhibitor of the echinocandin structural class. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved micafungin in March 2005. Micafungin inhibits an enzyme essential for fungal cell-wall synthesis. Depending on its concentration, micafungin may be fungicidal against some Candida, but is usually fungistatic against Apergillus. Micafungin can be used concomitantly with a variety of other drugs, including the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir and the transplant medications cyclosporine and tacrolimus. Micafungin inhibits the synthesis of beta-1,3-D-glucan, an essential component of fungal cell walls which is not present in mammalian cells. It does this by inhibiting beta-1,3-D-glucan synthase."
762,"Oral doxepin is approved for the following indications:    - Treatment of depression and/or anxiety.[A177163]  - Treatment of depression and/or anxiety associated with different conditions, including alcoholism, organic disease and manic-depressive disorders.[T249]  - Treatment of psychotic depressive disorders with associated anxiety.[T249]  - Treatment of involutional depression.[T249]   - Treatment of manic-depressive disorder.[T249]  - Treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep maintenance.[A177163]    Topical doxepin is also approved for short-term (up to 8 days) management of moderate pruritus in adult patients with atopic dermatitis, pruritus or lichen simplex chronicus.[T249]    Off-label, doxepin is used topically for the management of neuropathic pain.[A177172]    Depression is a common medical illness that causes feelings of sadness and or loss of interest in prior enjoyable activities. This condition can lead to emotional and physical disturbances that can decrease the ability of a person to function in a regular environment.[L5980]    Anxiety is a normal reaction of the body towards a normal danger. When the anxious state is exacerbated or appears on situations without danger, it is defined as an anxiety disorder. This disorders can appear in different forms such as phobias, panic, obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.[L5983]    Insomnia is a sleep disorder that directly affects the quality of life of the individual. It is characterized by the complication either to fall asleep or to stay asleep. This condition can be occasional or chronic.[L5986]    Pruritus is defined as an unpleasant skin reaction that provokes the urge to scratch. It can be localized or generalized and it can appear in an acute or chronic manner.[L5989]    Neuropathic pain occurs due to the damage or dysfunction of the peripheral or central nervous system rather than stimulation of the pain receptors.[L5992]Doxepin is a psychotropic agent with antidepressant and anxiolytic properties.[T559] It is a tertiary amine that can be presented as (E) and (Z) stereoisomers with the (Z) stereoisomer corresponding to [cidoxepin]. Doxepin commonly produces a 5:1 (E):(Z) racemic mixture.[T83]     In a strict sense, doxepin is not a tricyclic antidepressant but it is commonly associated with the class since it shares a lot of properties with members of the drug family including [amitriptyline], [clomipramine], [desipramine], [imipramine], [nortriptyline], [protriptyline] and [trimipramine].[L5977]     Doxepin was developed by Pfizer and FDA approved in 1969 as an antidepressant.[L5971] However, in 2010 it was approved for the treatment of insomnia. The latter indication was presented by Pernix Therapeutics.[L5974]Similar to other tricyclic antidepressants, doxepin was shown, in preclinical trials, to decrease the electrical activity of the brain, prolong the hexobarbital-induced sleep and block avoidance behavior without affecting the conditioned emotional response. At high doses, it also produces symptoms of central nervous system depression.[L5998]    Doxepin is known to cause antidepressant, sedative, and anticholinergic effects. At high doses, its anticholinergic and antiadrenergic properties are the most prevalent which limit its efficacy. These effects are observed at high doses where its affinity for H1 histamine receptor is lost and its binding to other receptors is observed.[A177163]    The maximal antidepressive effects of doxepin are present around two weeks following initiation of therapy.[T388] However, the sedative effects of doxepin, usually used for the treatment of insomnia or anxiety, are observed immediately after administration.[T249]Doxepin exact mechanism of action is not very clear. However, doxepin is known to be a selective histamine H1 receptor blocker.[A177163] This effect on histamine receptors indicates effectiveness in skin conditions.[T249]    Breaking its function according to the different effect, doxepin's antidepressive action is primarily associated with the inhibition of the central nervous system biogenic amine reuptake; more specifically, norepinephrine and serotonin at synaptic nerve terminals. This effect increases the level of monoamines in the synaptic site which in order increases the activity at the post-synaptic neuron receptor sites.[T388] It has been suggested that doxepin also desensitizes both serotonin 1A receptors and beta-adrenergic receptors.[T249]    It is known that the lack of dopamine transporters in the frontal cortex and the transmission of dopamine in this region is largely inactivated by the effect of norepinephrine reuptake. Hence, doxepin action on the frontal cortex is suggested to increase dopamine neurotransmission in this area.[T249]"
763,"For adjunctive treatment of: chronic simple (open-angle) glaucoma, secondary glaucoma, and preoperatively in acute angle-closure glaucoma where delay of surgery is desired in order to lower intraocular pressureA carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that is used in the treatment of glaucoma.Dichlorphenamide is an oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor indicated for adjunctive treatment of: chronic simple (open-angle) glaucoma, secondary glaucoma, and preoperatively in acute angle-closure glaucoma where delay of surgery is desired in order to lower intraocular pressure. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors reduce intraocular pressure by partially suppressing the secretion of aqueous humor (inflow).Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors reduce intraocular pressure by partially suppressing the secretion of aqueous humor (inflow), although the mechanism by which they do this is not fully understood. Evidence suggests that HCO3- ions are produced in the ciliary body by hydration of carbon dioxide under the influence of carbonic anhydrase and diffuse into the posterior chamber which contains more Na+ and HCO3- ions than does plasma and consequently is hypertonic. Water is then attracted to the posterior chamber by osmosis, resulting in a drop in pressure."

Antihistamines antagonize, in varying degrees, most of the pharmacological effects of histamine, including urticaria and pruritus.Diphenylpyraline is an antihistamine that prevents, but does not reverse, responses mediated by histamine alone. Diphenylpyraline antagonizes most of the pharmacological effects of histamine, including urticaria and pruritus. Also, diphenylpyraline may exhibit anticholinergic actions (as do most of the antihistamines) and may thus provide a drying effect on the nasal mucosa.Antihistamines such as diphenylpyraline used in the treatment of allergy act by competing with histamine for H1-receptor sites on effector cells. This reduces the effects of histamine, leading to a temporary reduction of allergy symptoms."
765,"For the treatment of depression.Nefazodone hydrochloride (trade name Serzone) is an antidepressant drug marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb. Its sale was discontinued in 2003 in some countries, due to the small possibility of hepatic (liver) injury. Drug-induced hepatic injuries were associated with an risk of elevated need for a liver transplant, or even death, with the incidence of severe liver damage was shown to be approximately 1 in 250,000 to 300,000 patient-years. On May 20, 2004, Bristol-Myers Squibb discontinued the sale of Serzone in the United States.Nefazodone, an antidepressant synthetically derived phenylpiperazine, is used to treat major depression. Although it is structurally similar to trazodone, nefazodone has a mechanism of action different from other antidepressants and, hence, lacks the risk for major cardiovascular toxicity seen with tricyclics and insomnia and inhibition of REM sleep seen with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.Within the serotonergic system, nefazodone acts as an antagonist at type 2 serotonin (5-HT2) post-synaptic receptors and, like fluoxetine-type antidepressants, inhibits pre-synaptic serotonin (5-HT) reuptake. These mechanisms increase the amount of serotonin available to interact with 5-HT receptors. Within the noradrenergic system, nefazodone inhibits norepinephrine uptake minimally. Nefazodone also antagonizes alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors, producing sedation, muscle relaxation, and a variety of cardiovascular effects. Nefazodone's affinity for benzodiazepine, cholinergic, dopaminergic, histaminic, and beta or alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors is not significant."
766,"For relief of symptoms in various depressive syndromes, especially endogenous depression. It has also been used to manage chronic peripheral neuropathic pain, as a second line agent for the management of anxiety disorders (e.g. panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder), and as a second or third line agent in the ADHD management. Desipramine hydrochloride is a dibenzazepine-derivative tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). TCAs are structurally similar to phenothiazines. They contain a tricyclic ring system with an alkyl amine substituent on the central ring. In non-depressed individuals, desipramine does not affect mood or arousal, but may cause sedation. In depressed individuals, desipramine exerts a positive effect on mood. TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Secondary amine TCAs, such as desipramine and nortriptyline, are more potent inhibitors of norepinephrine reuptake than tertiary amine TCAs, such as amitriptyline and doxepine. TCAs also down-regulate cerebral cortical &beta;-adrenergic receptors and sensitize post-synaptic serotonergic receptors with chronic use. The antidepressant effects of TCAs are thought to be due to an overall increase in serotonergic neurotransmission. TCAs also block histamine-H1 receptors, &alpha;1-adrenergic receptors and muscarinic receptors, which accounts for their sedative, hypotensive and anticholinergic effects (e.g. blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention), respectively. See toxicity section below for a complete listing of side effects. Desipramine exerts less anticholinergic and sedative side effects compared to tertiary amine TCAs, such as amitriptyline and clomipramine. Desipramine may be used to treat depression, neuropathic pain (unlabeled use), agitation and insomnia (unlabeled use) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (unlabeled use).Desipramine, a secondary amine tricyclic antidepressant, is structurally related to both the skeletal muscle relaxant cyclobenzaprine and the thioxanthene antipsychotics such as thiothixene. It is the active metabolite of imipramine, a tertiary amine TCA. The acute effects of desipramine include inhibition of noradrenaline re-uptake at noradrenergic nerve endings and inhibition of serotonin (5-hydroxy tryptamine, 5HT) re-uptake at the serotoninergic nerve endings in the central nervous system. Desipramine exhibits greater noradrenergic re-uptake inhibition compared to the tertiary amine TCA imipramine. In addition to inhibiting neurotransmitter re-uptake, desipramine down-regulates beta-adrenergic receptors in the cerebral cortex and sensitizes serotonergic receptors with chronic use. The overall effect is increased serotonergic transmission. Antidepressant effects are typically observed 2 - 4 weeks following the onset of therapy though some patients may require up to 8 weeks of therapy prior to symptom improvement. Patients experiencing more severe depressive episodes may respond quicker than those with mild depressive symptoms.Desipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) that selectively blocks reuptake of norepinephrine (noradrenaline) from the neuronal synapse. It also inhibits serotonin reuptake, but to a lesser extent compared to tertiary amine TCAs such as imipramine. Inhibition of neurotransmitter reuptake increases stimulation of the post-synaptic neuron.  Chronic use of desipramine also leads to down-regulation of beta-adrenergic receptors in the cerebral cortex and sensitization of serotonergic receptors. An overall increase in serotonergic transmission likely confers desipramine its antidepressant effects. Desipramine also possesses minor anticholinergic activity, through its affinity for muscarinic receptors. TCAs are believed to act by restoring normal levels of neurotransmitters via synaptic reuptake inhibition and by increasing serotonergic neurotransmission via serotonergic receptor sensitization in the central nervous system."

768,"For the treatment of bacterial infection caused by susceptible strains such as S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, or M. catarrhalis, S. pneumoniae (including multi-drug resistant strains [MDRSP]), M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, or K. pneumoniae. Gemifloxacin is a quinolone antibacterial agent with a broad-spectrum activity that is used in the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and mild-to-moderate pneumonia. It is available in oral formulations. Gemifloxacin acts by inhibiting DNA synthesis through the inhibition of both DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, which are essential for bacterial growth. Gemifloxacin is a quinolone/fluoroquinolone antibiotic. Gemifloxacin is bactericidal and its mode of action depends on blocking of bacterial DNA replication by binding itself to an enzyme called DNA gyrase, which allows the untwisting required to replicate one DNA double helix into two. Notably the drug has 100 times higher affinity for bacterial DNA gyrase than for mammalian. Gemifloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The bactericidal action of gemifloxacin results from inhibition of the enzymes topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV, which are required for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination."
769,"Bupropion is indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), seasonal affective disorder (SAD), and as an aid to smoking cessation.  Bupropion is also used off-label as a first-line treatment in patients with ADHD and comorbid bipolar disorder when used as an adjunct to mood stabilizers.[F4624]Bupropion (also known as the brand name product Wellbutrin®) is a norepinephrine/dopamine-reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) used most commonly for the management of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), and as an aid for smoking cessation. Bupropion exerts its pharmacological effects by weakly inhibiting the enzymes involved in the uptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine from the synaptic cleft, therefore prolonging their duration of action within the neuronal synapse and the downstream effects of these neurotransmitters. More specifically, bupropion binds to the norepinephrine transporter (NET) and the dopamine transporter (DAT).[A6399,A178810]    Bupropion was originally classified as an ""atypical"" antidepressant because it does not exert the same effects as the classical antidepressants such as Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs), Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs), or Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs). While it has comparable effectiveness to typical first-line options for the treatment of depression such as SSRIs,[A178798,A178804] bupropion is a unique option for the treatment of MDD as it lacks any clinically relevant serotonergic effects, typical of other mood medications, or any effects on histamine or adrenaline receptors.[A6399,A178840] Lack of activity at these receptors results in a more tolerable side effect profile; bupropion is less likely to cause sexual side effects, sedation, or weight gain as compared to SSRIs or TCAs, for example.[A178804,A178807]    When used as an aid to smoking cessation, bupropion is thought to confer its anti-craving and anti-withdrawal effects by inhibiting dopamine reuptake, which is thought to be involved in the reward pathways associated with nicotine, and through the antagonism of the nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptor.[A178825,A1966,A16508] A Cochrane Review of meta-analyses of available treatment modalities for smoking cessation found that abstinence rates approximately doubled when bupropion was used as compared to placebo, and was found to have similar rates of smoking cessation as [nicotine] replacement therapy (NRT).[A178816]    Bupropion is sometimes used as an add-on agent to first-line treatments of depression such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications when there is a treatment-failure or only partial response.[A178789] Bupropion is also used off-label for the management of Attention/Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adults with comorbid bipolar depression to avoid mood destabilization caused by typical stimulant medications used for the treatment of ADHD.[F4624]    When used in combination with [naltrexone] in the marketed product ContraveⓇ for chronic weight management, the two components are thought to have effects on areas of the brain involved in the regulation of food intake. This includes the hypothalamus, which is involved in appetite regulation, and the mesolimbic dopamine circuit, which is involved in reward pathways.[L6562,A179038,A179050] The combination of naltrexone and bupropion was shown to result in a statistically significant weight loss, with a mean change in body weight of -6.3% compared to -1.3% for placebo.[A179047]Bupropion is chemically unrelated to tricyclic, tetracyclic, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, or other known antidepressant agents. Compared to classical tricyclic antidepressants, Bupropion is a relatively weak inhibitor of the neuronal uptake of norepinephrine and dopamine. In addition, Bupropion does not inhibit monoamine oxidase. Bupropion has been found to be essentially inactive at the serotonin transporter (SERT)(IC50 >10 000 nM),[A178810] however both bupropion and its primary metabolite hydroxybupropion have been found to block the function of cation-selective serotonin type 3A receptors (5-HT3ARs).     Bupropion produces dose-related central nervous system (CNS) stimulant effects in animals, as evidenced by increased locomotor activity, increased rates of responding in various schedule-controlled operant behaviour tasks, and, at high doses, induction of mild stereotyped behaviour [FDA Label]. Due to these stimulant effects and selective activity at dopamine and norepinephrine receptors, bupropion has been identified as having an abuse potential.[FDA Label,A178846] Bupropion has a similar structure to the controlled substance [DB01560], and has been identified as having mild amphetamine-like activity, particularly when inhaled or injected.[A178846]    Bupropion is also known to lower the seizure threshold, making any pre-existing seizure conditions a contraindication to its use. This risk is exacerbated when bupropion is combined with other drugs or substances that lower the seizure threshold, such as [cocaine], or in clinical situations that would increase the risk of a seizure such as abrupt alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal.[FDA Label] As norepinephrine has been shown to have anticonvulsant properties, bupropion's inhibitory effects on NET are thought to contribute to its pro-convulsant activity.[A178846]    Bupropion has been shown to increase blood pressure and pose a risk for exacerbation of unmanaged or pre-existing hypertension,[A178852,FDA Label] however, clinical trials of bupropion in smokers with CVD have not identified an increased incidence of CV events including stroke or heart attack.[A178855] In clinical trials, the mean increase in systolic blood pressure associated with the use of bupropion was found to be 1.3 mmHg.[FDA Label]Bupropion is a norepinephrine/dopamine-reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) that exerts its pharmacological effects by weakly inhibiting the enzymes involved in the uptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine from the synaptic cleft, therefore prolonging their duration of action within the neuronal synapse and the downstream effects of these neurotransmitters.

770,"For use, with concurrent leucovorin administration (leucovorin protection), as an alternative therapy for the treatment of moderate-to-severe Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in immunocompromised patients, including patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Also used to treat several types of cancer including colon cancer.A nonclassical folic acid inhibitor through its inhibition of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. It is being tested for efficacy as an antineoplastic agent and as an antiparasitic agent against pneumocystis pneumonia in AIDS patients. Myelosuppression is its dose-limiting toxic effect.Trimetrexate, a non-classical folate antagonist, is a synthetic inhibitor of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). During DNA synthesis and cellular reproduction, folic acid is reduced to tetrahydrofolic acid by the enzyme folic acid reductase. By interfering with the reduction of folic acid, trimetrexate interferes with tissue cell reproduction. Generally, the most sensitive cells to the antimetabolite effect of trimetrexate are those cells which are most actively proliferating such as malignant cells, dermal epithelium, buccal and intestinal mucosa, bone marrow, fetal cells, and cells of the urinary bladder. Because the proliferation of cells in malignant tissues is greater than in most normal tissues, trimetrexate may impair the growth of the malignant tissues without causing irreversible damage to normal tissues. Due to very serious and potentially life-threatening side-effects of this drug, leucovorin must be co-administered for at least 72 hours after the last dose.In vitro studies have shown that trimetrexate is a competitive inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from bacterial, protozoan, and mammalian sources. DHFR catalyzes the reduction of intracellular dihydrofolate to the active coenzyme tetrahydrofolate. Inhibition of DHFR results in the depletion of this coenzyme, leading directly to interference with thymidylate biosynthesis, as well as inhibition of folate-dependent formyltransferases, and indirectly to inhibition of p.r.n. biosynthesis. The end result is disruption of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, with consequent cell death."
771,"For use in the prophylaxis and therapy of ventricular fibrillation. Also used in the treatment of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia, that have failed to respond to adequate doses of a first-line antiarrhythmic agent, such as lidocaine.Bretylium blocks the release of noradrenaline from the peripheral sympathetic nervous system, and is used in emergency medicine, cardiology, and other specialties for the acute management of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. The primary mode of action for bretylium is thought to be inhibition of voltage-gated K(+) channels. Recent evidence has shown that bretylium may also inhibit the Na,K-ATPase by binding to the extracellular K-site.Bretylium is a bromobenzyl quaternary ammonium compound which selectively accumulates in sympathetic ganglia and their postganglionic adrenergic neurons where it inhibits norepinephrine release by depressing adrenergic nerve terminal excitability. Bretylium also suppresses ventricular fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias.Bretylium inhibits norepinephrine release by depressing adrenergic nerve terminal excitability. The mechanisms of the antifibrillatory and antiarrhythmic actions of bretylium are not established. In efforts to define these mechanisms, the following electrophysiologic actions of bretylium have been demonstrated in animal experiments: increase in ventricular fibrillation threshold, increase in action potential duration and effective refractory period without changes in heart rate, little effect on the rate of rise or amplitude of the cardiac action potential (Phase 0) or in resting membrane potential (Phase 4) in normal myocardium, decrease in the disparity in action potential duration between normal and infarcted regions, and increase in impulse formation and spontaneous firing rate of pacemaker tissue as well as increase ventricular conduction velocity."
772,"For the induction and maintenance of general anesthesiaA nonflammable, halogenated, hydrocarbon anesthetic that provides relatively rapid induction with little or no excitement. Analgesia may not be adequate. nitrous oxide is often given concomitantly. Because halothane may not produce sufficient muscle relaxation, supplemental neuromuscular blocking agents may be required. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1994, p178)Halothane is a general inhalation anesthetic used for induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. It reduces the blood pressure and frequently decreases the pulse rate and depresses respiration. It induces muscle relaxation and reduces pains sensitivity by altering tissue excitability. It does so by decreasing the extent of gap junction mediated cell-cell coupling and altering the activity of the channels that underlie the action potential.Halothane causes general anaethesia due to its actions on multiple ion channels, which ultimately depresses nerve conduction, breathing, cardiac contractility. Its immobilizing effects have been attributed to its binding to potassium channels in cholinergic neurons. Halothane's effect are also likely due to binding to NMDA and calcium channels, causing hyperpolarization."

Dinoprost stimulates myometrial contractions (via its interaction with the prostaglandin receptors) in the gravid uterus that are similar to the contractions that occur in the term uterus during labor. These contractions are usually sufficient to cause abortion. Uterine response to prostaglandins increases gradually throughout pregnancy.

Similar to other local anesthetics, it increases the threshold for electrical excitation in nerves by slowing the propagation of the nerve impulse and reducing the rate of rise of the action potential.[L43402] The pharmacological profile of chloroprocaine is characterized by a short latency and duration, similar to the one observed with [lidocaine].[A252952] Chloroprocaine can be given as an injection, and is available in formulations with and without methylparaben as a preservative. Both can be given as intrathecal injections for peripheral and central nerve block, but only the preservative-free formulation can be used for lumbar and caudal epidural blocks.[A252952,L43382] Topical chloroprocaine for ophthalmic use was approved by the FDA in September 2022 for ocular surface anesthesia.[L43387]Chloroprocaine is an ester local anesthetic agent indicated for the production of local or regional anesthesia with effects on the cardiovascular and central nervous systems. Compared with lidocaine and bupivacaine, chloroprocaine has shorter ambulation and discharge times.[A252957] Chloroprocaine has minimal effects on cardiac conduction, excitability, refractoriness, contractility, and peripheral vascular resistance at therapeutic doses.[L43377,L43382] However, at toxic blood concentrations, chloroprocaine may cause atrioventricular block and cardiac arrest, as well as decreased cardiac output and arterial blood pressure. A high concentration of chloroprocaine in plasma can also lead to central nervous system stimulation, depression, or both. Some signs of central stimulation include restlessness, tremors and shivering, which may progress to convulsions. Depression, coma and respiratory arrest may also occur. As with other local anesthetics, patients may experience depression of the central nervous system without a prior stage of stimulation.[L43377,L43382]Chloroprocaine acts mainly by binding to the alpha subunit on the cytoplasmic region of voltage-gated sodium channels and inhibiting sodium influx in neuronal cell membranes.[L43402] This lowers the nerve membrane permeability to sodium and decreases the rate of rise of the action potential.[L43377,L43382] Therefore, chloroprocaine inhibits signal conduction and leads to a reversible nerve conduction blockade.[L43402] The progression of anesthesia depends on the diameter, myelination and conduction velocity of nerve fibers, and the order of loss of nerve function is the following: 1) pain, 2) temperature, 3) touch, 4) proprioception, and 5) skeletal muscle tone.[L43377,L43382]"
775,"Terazosin is indicated for use in treating symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia and hypertension[FDA Label].Terazosin is a quinazoline derivative alpha-1-selective adrenergic blocking agent indicated for benign prostatic hyperplasia and hypertension[FDA Label][A176831].

Inhibition of these alpha-1-adrenoceptors results in relaxation of smooth muscle in blood vessels and the prostate, lowering blood pressure and improving urinary flow[A176831,A176837,A5212,A5457]. Smooth muscle cells accounts for roughly 40% of the volume of the prostate and so their relaxation reduces pressure on the urethra[A176837].    It has also been shown that catecholamines induce factors responsible for mitogenesis and alpha-1-adrenergic receptor blockers inhibit this effect[A176837].    A final long term mechanism of terazosin and other alpha-1-adrenergic receptor blockers is the induction of apoptosis of prostate cells[A176837].

Amdinocillin is not available in the United States.Amdinocillin is a novel, semisynthetic penicillin effective against many gram-negative bacteria. The antibacterial activity of amdinocillin is derived from its ability to bind specifically and avidly to Penicillin Binding Protein-2 (PBP 2). Amdinocillin is active alone against many gram-negative organisms. Pseudomonas and non-fermenting gram-negative bacteria, however, are usually resistant. Amdinocillin, in combination with many beta-lactams, exhibits marked synergy against many enterobacteriaceae. No such synergy can be demonstrated for gram-positive organisms or pseudomonas species. Amdinocillin is not beta-lactamase stable. Organisms which produce high levels of plasma-mediated beta-lactamase are resistant to the drug.Amdinocillin is a stong and specific antagonist of Penicillin Binding Protein-2 (PBP 2). It is active against gram negative bacteria, preventing cell wall synthesis by inhibiting the activity of PBP2. PBP2 is a peptidoglycan elongation initiating enzyme. Peptidoglycan is a polymer of sugars and amino acids that is the main component of bacterial cell walls. "
777,"For the treatment of infections (respiratory tract, kidney, skin, soft tissue, UTI), urethral and cervical gonorrhoea.A synthetic fluoroquinolone (fluoroquinolones) antibacterial agent that inhibits the supercoiling activity of bacterial DNA gyrase, halting DNA replication.Ofloxacin is a quinolone/fluoroquinolone antibiotic. Ofloxacin is bactericidal and its mode of action depends on blocking of bacterial DNA replication by binding itself to an enzyme called DNA gyrase, which allows the untwisting required to replicate one DNA double helix into two. Notably the drug has 100 times higher affinity for bacterial DNA gyrase than for mammalian. Ofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.Ofloxacin acts on DNA gyrase and toposiomerase IV, enzymes which, like human topoisomerase, prevents the excessive supercoiling of DNA during replication or transcription. By inhibiting their function, the drug thereby inhibits normal cell division."
778,"Indicated for the alleviation of symptoms of intermittent claudication (pain in the legs that occurs with walking and disappears with rest).Cilostazol is a quinolinone derivative and antiplatelet agent with vasodilating properties that has been used in the symptomatic treatment of intermittent claudication in patients with peripheral ischaemia. It is marketed under the brand name Pletal by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co.. Cilostazol works by inhibiting both primary and secondary aggregation and reducing calcium-induced contractions.Cilostazol reduces the symptoms of intermittent claudication, as indicated by an increased walking distance. Intermittent claudication is pain in the legs that occurs with walking and disappears with rest. The pain occurs due to reduced blood flow to the legs.Cilostazol and several of its metabolites are cyclic AMP (cAMP) phosphodiesterase III inhibitors (PDE III inhibitors), inhibiting phosphodiesterase activity and suppressing cAMP degradation with a resultant increase in cAMP in platelets and blood vessels, leading to inhibition of platelet aggregation and vasodilation."
779,"Itraconazole is indicated for the treatment of the following fungal infections in immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised patients:[L50051, L50056]    - Blastomycosis, pulmonary and extrapulmonary  - Histoplasmosis, including chronic cavitary pulmonary disease and disseminated, nonmeningeal histoplasmosis, and  - Aspergillosis, pulmonary and extrapulmonary, in patients who are intolerant of or who are refractory to amphotericin B therapy    It is also indicated for the treatment of the following fungal infections in non-immunocompromised patients:[L50051]    - Onychomycosis of the toenail, with or without fingernail involvement, due to dermatophytes (tinea unguium)  - Onychomycosis of the fingernail due to dermatophytes (tinea unguium).    Itraconazole oral solution is indicated for the treatment of oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis.[L50061]First synthesized in the early 1980s, itraconazole is a broad-spectrum triazole antifungal agent used to treat a variety of infections.[A34257] It is a 1:1:1:1 racemic mixture of four diastereomers, made up of two enantiomeric pairs, each possessing three chiral centers.[L50051] Itraconazole was first approved in the US in 1992 [L50056] and is available orally. While the intravenous formulation of the drug was formerly available, it was discontinued in the US in 2007.[A263232]Itraconazole is an antifungal agent that inhibits cell growth and promotes cell death of fungi.[A34257] It exhibits in vitro activity against _Blastomyces dermatitidis_, _Histoplasma capsulatum_, _Histoplasma duboisii_, _Aspergillus flavus_, _Aspergillus fumigatus_, and _Trichophyton_ species.[L50051]Itraconazole mediates its antifungal activity by inhibiting 14α-demethylase, a fungal cytochrome P450 enzyme that converts lanosterol to ergosterol, a vital component of fungal cell membranes.[L50051] The azole nitrogen atoms in the chemical structure of itraconazole form a complex with the active site, or the haem iron, of the fungal enzyme to impede its function.[A34257, A263232] The accumulation of lanosterol and 14-methylated sterols results in increased permeability of the fungal cell membrane, and modified membrane-bound enzyme activity, and dysregulated chitin synthesis.[A34257, A263222, A263227] Other proposed mechanisms of action of itraconazole include the inhibition of fungal cytochrome c oxidative and peroxidative enzymes that also lead to the disruption of fungal cell membranes.[A34257]"
780,"For use with other anticancer drugs for the treatment of stage III and stage IV Hodgkin's disease.An antineoplastic agent used primarily in combination with mechlorethamine, vincristine, and prednisone (the MOPP protocol) in the treatment of Hodgkin's disease.Procarbazine is an antineoplastic in the class of alkylating agents and is used to treat various forms of cancer. Alkylating agents are so named because of their ability to add alkyl groups to many electronegative groups under conditions present in cells. They stop tumor growth by cross-linking guanine bases in DNA double-helix strands - directly attacking DNA. This makes the strands unable to uncoil and separate. As this is necessary in DNA replication, the cells can no longer divide. In addition, these drugs add methyl or other alkyl groups onto molecules where they do not belong which in turn inhibits their correct utilization by base pairing and causes a miscoding of DNA. Procarbazine is cell-phase specific for the S phase of cell division.The precise mode of cytotoxic action of procarbazine has not been clearly defined. There is evidence that the drug may act by inhibition of protein, RNA and DNA synthesis. Studies have suggested that procarbazine may inhibit transmethylation of methyl groups of methionine into t-RNA. The absence of functional t-RNA could cause the cessation of protein synthesis and consequently DNA and RNA synthesis. In addition, procarbazine may directly damage DNA. Hydrogen peroxide, formed during the auto-oxidation of the drug, may attack protein sulfhydryl groups contained in residual protein which is tightly bound to DNA."
781,"For induction of remission and consolidation in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), and whose APL is characterized by the presence of the t(15;17) translocation or PML/RAR-alpha gene expressionArsenic trioxide is a chemotherapeutic agent of idiopathic function used to treat leukemia that is unresponsive to first line agents. It is suspected that arsenic trisulfide induces cancer cells to undergo apoptosis. In general, arsenic is known to be a naturally toxic substance capable of eliciting a variety of dangerous adverse effects. The enzyme thioredoxin reductase has recently been identified as a target for arsenic trioxide.Arsenic Trioxide is indicated for induction of remission and consolidation in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) who are refractory to, or have relapsed from, retinoid and anthracycline chemotherapy.The mechanism of action of Arsenic Trioxide is not completely understood. Arsenic trioxide causes morphological changes and DNA fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis in NB4 human promyelocytic leukemia cells <i>in vitro</i>. Arsenic trioxide also causes damage or degradation of the fusion protein PML/RAR-alpha. It is suspected that arsenic trioxide induces cancer cells to undergo apoptosis."
782,"For the treatment of moderate and severe hypertension, either alone or as an adjunct, and for the treatment of renal hypertension.An antihypertensive agent that acts by inhibiting selectively transmission in post-ganglionic adrenergic nerves. It is believed to act mainly by preventing the release of norepinephrine at nerve endings and causes depletion of norepinephrine in peripheral sympathetic nerve terminals as well as in tissues. [PubChem]High blood pressure can cause the heart and arteries to not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if blood pressure is controlled. Guanethidine works by decreasing the heart rate and relaxing the blood vessels so that blood can flow more easily through the body, thereby reducing these risks. It is a postganglionic sympathetic nerve terminal blocker that prevents the release of norepinephrine from nerve terminals.Guanethidine acts at the sympathetic neuroeffector junction by inhibiting or interfering with the release and/or distribution of norepinephrine (NE), rather than acting at the effector cell by inhibiting the association of norepinephrine with its receptors. It is taken up by norepinephrine transporters to be concentrated within the transmitter vesicles in place of NE, leading to gradual depletion of NE stores in the nerve endings. Guanethidine at the nerve terminal blocks the release of noradrenaline in response to an action potential. In contrast to ganglionic blocking agents, Guanethidine suppresses equally the responses mediated by alpha-and beta-adrenergic receptors but does not produce parasympathetic blockade. Since sympathetic blockade results in modest decreases in peripheral resistance and cardiac output, Guanethidine lowers blood pressure in the supine position. It further reduces blood pressure by decreasing the degree of vasoconstriction that normally results from reflex sympathetic nervous activity upon assumption of the upright posture, thus reducing venous return and cardiac output more."
783,"For the treatment of major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder [A31901].A reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) selective for isoform A (RIMA) used to treat major depressive disorder. Most meta-analyses and most studies indicate that in the acute management of depression, moclobemide is more efficacious than placebo medication and similarly efficacious as tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).  Due to negligible anticholinergic and antihistaminic actions, moclobemide has been better tolerated than tri- or heterocyclic antidepressants [A31901]. A selective, reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO) which increases the [A31901]. Besides its presence in sympathetic nerves, there is an abundant evidence that MAO-A is localized in noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus and MAO-B is closely associated with serotonergic neurons of the raphe nucleus [A31901].The mechanism of action of moclobemide involves the selective, reversible inhibition of MAO-A. This inhibition leads to a decrease in the metabolism and destruction of monoamines in the neurotransmitters. This results in an increase in the monoamines, relieving depressive symptoms [A31901, A31902]."
784,"Indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomfort associated with acute painful musculo skeletal conditions.A muscarinic antagonist used to treat drug-induced parkinsonism and to relieve pain from muscle spasm.Orphenadrine is indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomfort associated with acute painful musculoskeletal conditions. Orphenadrine is an anticholinergic with a predominantly central effect and only a weak peripheral effect. In addition, it has mild antihistaminic and local anaesthetic properties. Parkinson's syndrome is the consequence of a disturbed balance between cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission in the basal ganglia caused by a decrease in dopamine. Orphenadrine restores the physiological equilibrium and has a favourable effect on the rigidity and tremor of Parkinson's disease and Parkinsonian syndromes. The effect is somewhat less on bradykinesia.Orphenadrine binds and inhibits both histamine H1 receptors and NMDA receptors. It restores the motor disturbances induced by neuroleptics, in particular the hyperkinesia. The dopamine deficiency in the striatum increases the stimulating effects of the cholinergic system. This stimulation is counteracted by the anticholinergic effect of orphenadrine. It may have a relaxing effect on skeletal muscle spasms and it has a mood elevating effect."
785,"For the treatment of all types of seizures except absence seizures.A barbituric acid derivative that acts as a nonselective central nervous system depressant. It promotes binding to inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid subtype receptors, and modulates chloride currents through receptor channels. It also inhibits glutamate induced depolarizations.Phenobarbital, the longest-acting barbiturate, is used for its anticonvulsant and sedative-hypnotic properties in the management of all seizure disorders except absence (petit mal).Phenobarbital acts on GABAA receptors, increasing synaptic inhibition. This has the effect of elevating seizure threshold and reducing the spread of seizure activity from a seizure focus. Phenobarbital may also inhibit calcium channels, resulting in a decrease in excitatory transmitter release. The sedative-hypnotic effects of phenobarbital are likely the result of its effect on the polysynaptic midbrain reticular formation, which controls CNS arousal."
786,"For prevention and treatment of nausea, vomiting, and dizziness associated with motion sickness, and vertigo (dizziness caused by other medical problems).A histamine H1 antagonist given by mouth or parenterally for the control of postoperative and drug-induced vomiting and in motion sickness. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p935)Cyclizine is a piperazine-derivative antihistamine used as an antivertigo/antiemetic agent. Cyclizine is used in the prevention and treatment of nausea, vomiting, and dizziness associated with motion sickness. Additionally, it has been used in the management of vertigo in diseases affecting the vestibular apparatus. Although the mechanism by which cyclizine exerts its antiemetic and antivertigo effects has not been fully elucidated, its central anticholinergic properties are partially responsible. The drug depresses labyrinth excitability and vestibular stimulation, and it may affect the medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone. It also possesses anticholinergic, antihistaminic, central nervous system depressant, and local anesthetic effects.Vomiting (emesis) is essentially a protective mechanism for removing irritant or otherwise harmful substances from the upper GI tract. Emesis or vomiting is controlled by the vomiting centre in the medulla region of the brain, an important part of which is the chemotrigger zone (CTZ). The vomiting centre possesses neurons which are rich in muscarinic cholinergic and histamine containing synapses. These types of neurons are especially involved in transmission from the vestibular apparatus to the vomiting centre. Motion sickness principally involves overstimulation of these pathways due to various sensory stimuli. Hence the action of cyclizine which acts to block the histamine receptors in the vomiting centre and thus reduce activity along these pathways. Furthermore since cyclizine possesses anti-cholinergic properties as well, the muscarinic receptors are similarly blocked."
787,"Used in the management of anxiety and in the treatment of muscle spasm.A non-benzodiazepine that is used in the management of anxiety. It has been suggested for use in the treatment of muscle spasm.Chlormezanone is a non-benzodiazepine muscle relaxant. It was discontinued worldwide in 1996 by its manufacturer due to confirmed serious and rare cutaneous reactions (toxic epidermal necrolysis).Chlormezanone binds to central benzodiazepine receptors which interact allosterically with GABA receptors. This potentiates the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, increasing the inhibition of the ascending reticular activating system and blocking the cortical and limbic arousal that occurs following stimulation of the reticular pathways."
788,"For the treatment of hypertension.Rescinnamine is an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor used as an antihypertensive drug. It is an alkaloid obtained from _Rauwolfia serpentina_ and other species of _Rauwolfia_.Used to treat hypertension. Rescinnamine inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex and general vasoconstriction, both of which lead to increases vascular resistance. By inhibiting angiotensin II, aldosterone reabsorption is decreased as well as vasoconstriction. This combined effect serves to decrease blood pressure.Rescinnamine Binds to and inhibits the angiotensin converting enzyme. Rescinnamine competes with angiotensin I for binding at the angiotensin-converting enzyme, blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II. As angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor and a negative-feedback mediator for renin activity, lower concentrations result in a decrease in blood pressure and stimulation of baroreceptor reflex mechanisms, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion."
789,"Used as a component of various chemotherapeutic regimens as third-line therapy for recurrent or refractory germ cell testicular cancer. Also used as a component of various chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of cervical cancer, as well as in conjunction with surgery and/or radiation therapy in the treatment of various soft tissue sarcomas. Other indications include treatment of osteosarcoma, bladder cancer, ovarian cancer. small cell lung cancer, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.Ifosfamide is a chemotherapeutic agent chemically related to the nitrogen mustards and a synthetic analog of cyclophosphamide. It is active as an alkylating agent and an immunosuppressive agent.Ifosfamide requires activation by microsomal liver enzymes to active metabolites in order to exert its cytotoxic effects. Activation occurs by hydroxylation at the ring carbon atom 4 to form the unstable intermediate 4-hydroxyifosfamide. This metabolite than rapidly degrades to the stable urinary metabolite 4-ketoifosfamide. The stable urinary metabolite, 4-carboxyifosfamide, is formed upon opening of the ring. These urinary metabolites have not been found to be cytotoxic. N, N-bis (2-chloroethyl)-phosphoric acid diamide (ifosphoramide) and acrolein are also found. The major urinary metabolites, dechloroethyl ifosfamide and dechloroethyl cyclophosphamide, are formed upon enzymatic oxidation of the chloroethyl side chains and subsequent dealkylation. It is the alkylated metabolites of ifosfamide that have been shown to interact with DNA. Ifosfamide is cycle-phase nonspecific.The exact mechanism of ifosfamide has not been determined, but appears to be similar to other alkylating agents. Ifosfamide requires biotransformation in the liver by mixed-function  oxidases (cytochrome P450 system) before it becomes active. After metabolic activation, active metabolites of ifosfamide alkylate or bind with many intracellular molecular structures, including nucleic acids. The cytotoxic action is primarily through the alkylation of DNA, done by attaching the N-7 position of guanine to its reactive electrophilic groups. The formation of inter and intra strand cross-links in the DNA results in cell death."
790,"Used to prolong the time to recurrence of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/flutter (PAF) associated with disabling symptoms in patients without structural heart disease. Also used for the treatment of life-threatening documented ventricular arrhythmias, such as sustained ventricular tachycardia.An antiarrhythmia agent that is particularly effective in ventricular arrhythmias. It also has weak beta-blocking activity. The drug is generally well tolerated.Propafenone is a Class 1C antiarrhythmic drug with local anesthetic effects, and a direct stabilizing action on myocardial membranes. It is used in the treatment of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. It acts by inhibiting sodium channels to restrict the entry of sodium into cardiac cells resulting in reduced excitation. Propafenone has local anesthetic activity approximately equal to procaine.The electrophysiological effect of propafenone manifests itself in a reduction of upstroke velocity (Phase 0) of the monophasic action potential. In Purkinje fibers, and to a lesser extent myocardial fibers, propafenone reduces the fast inward current carried by sodium ions, which is responsible for the drugs antiarrhythmic actions. Diastolic excitability threshold is increased and effective refractory period prolonged. Propafenone reduces spontaneous automaticity and depresses triggered activity. At very high concentrations in vitro, propafenone can inhibit the slow inward current carried by calcium but this calcium antagonist effect probably does not contribute to antiarrhythmic efficacy."
791,"For management of dyspepsia, heartburn, epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting.A specific blocker of dopamine receptors. It speeds gastrointestinal peristalsis, causes prolactin release, and is used as antiemetic and tool in the study of dopaminergic mechanisms.Domperidone is a specific blocker of dopamine receptors. It speeds gastrointestinal peristalsis, causes prolactin release, and is used as antiemetic and tool in the study of dopaminergic mechanisms.Domperidone acts as a gastrointestinal emptying (delayed) adjunct and peristaltic stimulant. The gastroprokinetic properties of domperidone are related to its peripheral dopamine receptor blocking properties. Domperidone facilitates gastric emptying and decreases small bowel transit time by increasing esophageal and gastric peristalsis and by lowering esophageal sphincter pressure. Antiemetic: The antiemetic properties of domperidone are related to its dopamine receptor blocking activity at both the chemoreceptor trigger zone and at the gastric level. It has strong affinities for the D2 and D3 dopamine receptors, which are found in the chemoreceptor trigger zone, located just outside the blood brain barrier, which - among others - regulates nausea and vomiting"
792,"In males, used as replacement therapy in conditions associated with symptoms of deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone. In females, for palliation of androgenresponsive recurrent mammary cancer in women who are more than one year but less than five years postmenopausal.An anabolic steroid that has been used in the treatment of male hypogonadism, delayed puberty in males, and in the treatment of breast neoplasms in women.Fluoxymesterone is a synthetic androgen, or male hormone, similar to testosterone. Fluoxymesterone works by attaching itself to androgen receptors; this causes it to interact with the parts of the cell involved in the making of proteins. It may cause an increase in the synthesis of some proteins or a decrease in the synthesis of others. These proteins have a variety of effects, including blocking the growth of some types of breast cancer cells, stimulating cells that cause male sexual characteristics, and stimulating the production of red blood cells.Fluoxymesterone is a synthetic androgenic anabolic steroid and is approximately 5 times as potent as natural methyltestosterone. Like testosterone and other androgenic hormones, fluoxymesterone binds to the androgen receptor. It produces retention of nitrogen, sodium, potassium, and phosphorus; increases protein anabolism; decreases amino acid catabolism and decreased urinary excretion of calcium. The antitumour activity of fluoxymesterone appears related to reduction or competitive inhibition of prolactin receptors or estrogen receptors or production."
793,"Desflurane is indicated for the induction and maintenance of anesthesia in adults, as well as the maintenance of anesthesia in pediatric patients.[L30285]Desflurane, or I-653, a a volatile anesthetic that is more rapidly cleared and less metabolized than previous inhaled anesthetics such as [methoxyflurane], [sevoflurane], [enflurane], or [isoflurane].[A226390,A39015,A226893]. It was developed in the late 1980s out of a need for a more rapidly acting and rapidly cleared inhaled anesthetic.[A226883,A226888]    Desflurane was granted FDA approval on 18 September 1992.[L30285]Desflurane is a general inhalation anesthetic.[L30285] It has a short duration of action as it is rapidly cleared.[L30285] Patients should be counselled regarding the risks of malignant hyperthermia, perioperative hyperkalemia, respiratory adverse reactions in pediatric patients, QTc prolongation, hepatobiliary disorders, pediatric neurotoxicity, and postoperative agitation in children.[L30285]The mechanism of inhalational anesthetics is still not fully understood.[A226490] They can block excitatory ion channels and increase the activity of inhibitory ion channels.[A226490] The most notable agonism is at the GABAA channel.[A226520] Desflurane is also an agonist of glycine receptors,[A10308] antagonist of glutamate receptors,[A10309] inducer of potassium voltage gated channels,[A10310] and inhibits both NADH-ubiquinone oxioreductase chain 1[A11113] and calcium transporting ATPases.[A4367]    An older school of thought is the unitary theory of general anesthetic action, suggesting that desflurane affects the lipid bilayer of cells.[A226490,A226510] Studies of other halogenated inhalational anesthetics have shown that the lipid bilayer spreads out more thinly as the anesthetic incorporates into the bilayer.[A226495] However, the anesthetic does not bind to lipid heads or acyl chains of hydrocarbons in the bilayer.[A226495] The effect of incorporating into the lipid bilayer is not well described.[A226495,L30285] By incorporating into the lipid bilayer, anesthetics may introduce disorder in the lipids, leading to some indirect effect on ion channels.[A226510] However, this theory remains controversial.[A226515]"
794,"In oral and parenteral formulations, clindamycin is indicated for the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria, as well as susceptible staphylococci, streptococci, and pneumococci.[L11599,L11602] Used topically, it is indicated for the treatment of acne vulgaris[L11593,L11611,L11605] and is available in combination with [benzoyl peroxide][L11584] or [tretinoin][L11590] for this purpose, or as a triple combination therapy with benzoyl peroxide and [adapalene].[L48666] Clindamycin is also indicated as a vaginal cream[L11596], suppository[L11608], or gel[L39416] for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis in non-pregnant females.    Clindamycin is used for antimicrobial prophylaxis against _Viridans_ group streptococcal infections in susceptible patients undergoing oral, dental, or upper respiratory surgery, and may be used for prophylaxis against bacterial endocarditis in penicillin-allergic patients at high risk of these infections.[L11629]Clindamycin is a semi-synthetic lincosamide antibiotic used in the treatment of a variety of serious infections due to susceptible microorganisms[L11599,L11596] as well as topically for acne vulgaris.[L11593] It has a relatively narrow spectrum of activity that includes anaerobic bacteria as well as gram-positive cocci and bacilli and gram-negative bacilli.[A190621] Interestingly, clindamycin appears to carry some activity against protozoans, and has been used off-label in the treatment of toxoplasmosis, malaria, and babesiosis.[A190657]    Clindamycin is derived from, and has largely replaced, [lincomycin], a naturally occurring lincosamide and the eponymous member of this antibiotic class, due to its improved properties over the parent compound. The name lincomycin is derived from Lincoln, Nebraska, where it was first isolated from _Streptomyces lincolnensis_ found in a soil sample.[A190621]Clindamycin exerts its bacteriostatic effect via inhibition of microbial protein synthesis.[A190621] Clindamycin has a relatively short T<sub>max</sub> and half-life necessitating administration every six hours to ensure adequate antibiotic concentrations.[L11629]     _Clostridium difficile_ associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been observed in patients using clindamycin, ranging in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis and occasionally occurring over two months following cessation of antibiotic therapy.[L11602] Overgrowth of _C. difficile_ resulting from antibiotic use, along with its production of A and B toxins, contributes to morbidity and mortality in these patients. Because of the associated risks, clindamycin should be reserved for serious infections for which the use of less toxic antimicrobial agents are inappropriate.[L11602]    Clindamycin is active against a number of gram-positive aerobic bacteria, as well as both gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes.[L11599] Resistance to clindamycin may develop, and is generally the result of base modification within the 23S ribosomal RNA. Cross-resistance between clindamycin and lincomycin is complete, and may also occur between clindamycin and macrolide antibiotics (e.g. [erythromycin]) due to similarities in their binding sites.[L11599]    As antimicrobial susceptibility patterns are geographically distinct, local antibiograms should be consulted to ensure adequate coverage of relevant pathogens prior to use.Clindamycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to 23S RNA of the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome.[L11599] It impedes both the assembly of the ribosome and the translation process.[L11629] The molecular mechanism through which this occurs is thought to be due to clindamycin's three-dimensional structure, which closely resembles the 3'-ends of L-Pro-Met-tRNA and deacylated-tRNA during the peptide elongation cycle - in acting as a structural analog of these tRNA molecules, clindamycin impairs peptide chain initiation and may stimulate dissociation of peptidyl-tRNA from bacterial ribosomes.[A190621]    The mechanism through which topical clindamycin treats acne vulgaris is unclear, but may be related to its activity against _Propionibacterium acnes_, a bacteria that has been associated with acne.[L11593] "
795,"For the management of obesity including weight loss and maintenance of weight loss in patients on a reduced calorie dietDexfenfluramine, also marketed under the name Redux, is a serotoninergic anorectic drug. For a fairly limited time during the middle of the nineties, the US FDA had approved it for use in managing weight loss. However, following multiple concerns about the cardiovascular side-effects of the drug, such approval was withdrawn.Used to treat diabetes and obesity, Dexfenfluramine decreases caloric intake by increasing serotonin levels in the brain&rsquo;s synapses. Dexfenfluramine acts as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. It also causes release of serotonin from the synaptosomes.Dexfenfluramine binds to the serotonin reuptake pump. This causes inhbition of serotonin reuptake. The increased levels of serotonin lead to greater serotonin receptor activation which in turn lead to enhancement of serotoninergic transmission in the centres of feeding behavior located in the hypothalamus. This suppresses the appetite for carbohydrates."
796,"For the treatment of moderate-to-severe pain.An opioid analgesic with actions and uses similar to those of morphine, apart from an absence of cough suppressant activity. It is used in the treatment of moderate to severe pain, including pain in obstetrics. It may also be used as an adjunct to anesthesia (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p1092). On June 8, 2017, FDA requested Endo Pharmaceuticals to remove the medication from the market due to opioid misuse and abuse risks associated with the product's injectable reformulation.Oxymorphone is a semi-synthetic opioid substitute for morphine. It is a potent analgesic. Opioid analgesics exert their principal pharmacologic effects on the CNS and the gastrointestinal tract. The principal actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation. Opioids produce respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The mechanism of respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation.Oxymorphone interacts predominantly with the opioid mu-receptor. These mu-binding sites are discretely distributed in the human brain, with high densities in the posterior amygdala, hypothalamus, thalamus, nucleus caudatus, putamen, and certain cortical areas. They are also found on the terminal axons of primary afferents within laminae I and II (substantia gelatinosa) of the spinal cord and in the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve. Also, it has been shown that oxymorphone binds to and inhibits GABA inhibitory interneurons via mu-receptors. These interneurons normally inhibit the descending pain inhibition pathway. So, without the inhibitory signals, pain modulation can proceed downstream."
797,"For the management of hypertension and ventricular premature beats in adults.A cardioselective beta-adrenergic antagonist with little effect on the bronchial receptors. The drug has stabilizing and quinidine-like effects on cardiac rhythm as well as weak inherent sympathomimetic action.Acebutolol is a cardioselective, beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agent, which possesses mild intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) in its therapeutically effective dose range. In general, beta-blockers reduce the work the heart has to do and allow it to beat more regularly. Acebutolol has less antagonistic effects on peripheral vascular &szlig;2-receptors at rest and after epinephrine stimulation than nonselective beta-antagonists. Low doses of acebutolol produce less evidence of bronchoconstriction than nonselective agents like propranolol but more than atenolol.Acebutolol is a selective &beta;1-receptor antagonist. Activation of &beta;1-receptors by epinephrine increases the heart rate and the blood pressure, and the heart consumes more oxygen. Acebutolol blocks these receptors, lowering the heart rate and blood pressure. This drug then has the reverse effect of epinephrine. In addition, beta blockers prevent the release of renin, which is a hormone produced by the kidneys which leads to constriction of blood vessels."
798,"[L35320]Brinzolamide is a highly specific, non-competitive, reversible carbonic anhydrase II (CA-II) inhibitor indicated to reduce ocular pressure in patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma.[L35310] Although the exact pathophysiology of glaucoma is still unknown, one of the main hallmarks of this disease is vascular dysregulation and abnormalities.[A2049,A2051] The resulting vascular resistance increases intraocular pressure, thus impairing ocular perfusion.[A2049,A2051] Although systemic anti-carbonic anhydrase (CA) therapy has been used for almost 50 years with varying degrees of success, systemic administration results in an increase in incidences of adverse effects.[A2049,A2051]    Brinzolamide was developed as a topical solution to the systemic side effects and [dorzolamide], the first-ever approved topical CA inhibitor with contrasting results and evidence.[A2051] Unlike [dorzolamide], brinzolamide has a higher lipophilicity to facilitate diffusion across the blood-retinal barrier.[A2051] Brinzolamide was approved by the FDA in 1998 as a standalone product and in 2013 as a combination product with brimonidine tartrate.[L35310,L35315] In Europe, it was also approved as a combination product with timolol in 2008.[L35320]Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase II (CA-II) in the ciliary process of the eye slows the formation of bicarbonate and thus fluid flow, lowering intraocular pressure (IOP).[A2053,A2055]    The IOP-reducing effect of brinzolamide as adjunctive therapy to the prostaglandin analog travoprost was studied. Following a 4-week run-in with travoprost, patients with an IOP ≥19 mmHg were randomized to receive added treatment with brinzolamide or timolol. An additional decrease in mean diurnal IOP of 3.2 to 3.4 mmHg for the brinzolamide group and 3.2 to 4.2 mmHg for the timolol group were observed. There was an overall higher incidence of non-serious ocular adverse reactions, mainly related to signs of local irritation, in the brinzolamide/travoprost groups. The events were mild and did not affect the overall discontinuation rates in the studies.[L46412]    A clinical trial was conducted with brinzolamide in 32 pediatric patients less than 6 years of age, diagnosed with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Some patients were naive to IOP therapy whilst others were on other IOP-lowering medicinal product(s). Those who had been on previous IOP medicinal products were not required to discontinue their IOP medicinal product(s) until the initiation of monotherapy with brinzolamide.[L46412]    Among patients who were naive to IOP therapy (10 patients), the efficacy of brinzolamide was similar to that seen previously in adults, with mean IOP reductions from baseline ranging up to 5 mmHg. Among patients who were on topical IOP-lowering medicinal products (22 patients), mean IOP increased slightly from baseline in the brinzolamide group.[L46412]Brinzolamide is a highly specific, reversible, non-competitive inhibitor of carbonic anhydrases (CA), the enzymes catalyzing the reversible reaction of water and carbon dioxide (CO2) to form bicarbonate ions.[A2053] Although there are 7 isoforms of CA in human tissues, brinzolamide has the highest affinity to CA II.[A2053,A2055] Brinzolamide and its active metabolites were not found to displace any known ligands in vitro from their respective receptors or enzymes commonly involved in producing side effects or ancillary pharmacology, thus explaining brinzolamide's high order of safety.[A2055]  "
799,"In New Zealand and America, flecainide is indicated to prevent supraventricular arrhythmias and ventricular arrhythmias.[L8878] In the United States, it is also indicated to prevent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and flutter.[A186886,L5056]Flecainide is a Class I anti-arrhythmic agent like [encainide] and [propafenone].[A186880] Flecainide’s development began in 1966 and was first synthesized in 1972 as an attempt to generate new anesthetics.[A186931] It is used to prevent supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, as well as paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and flutter.[L8878,L5056]    Flecainide was granted FDA approval on 31 October 1985.[L8875]Flecainide inhibits the action of sodium and potassium ion channels in the heart, raising the threshold for depolarization and correcting arrhythmias.[A186931] Flecainide has a long duration of action, allowing for once daily dosing.[L8878] The therapeutic index is narrow.[A37372] Patients should not take this medication if there is already structural heart disease or left ventricular systolic dysfunction.[L8878]Flecainide blocks fast inward sodium channels and slowly unbinds during diastole, prolonging the refractory period of the heart.[A186931] This blockade also shortens the duration of action potentials through the Purkinjie fibers.[A186931] Flecainide also prevents delayed rectifier potassium channels from opening, lengthening the action potential through ventricular and atrial muscle fibers.[A186931] Finally, flecainide also blocks ryanodine receptor opening, reducing calcium release from sarcoplasmic reticulum, which reduces depolarization of cells.[A186931]"
800,"For the palliative treatment of patients with metastatic and/or progressive carcinoma of the prostateA nitrogen mustard linked to estradiol, usually as phosphate; used to treat prostatic neoplasms; also has radiation protective properties.Estramustine is an antineoplastic agent indicated in the palliative treatment of patients with metastatic and/or progressive carcinoma of the prostate. Estramustine is a combination of estradiol with nitrogen mustard. In vivo, the nitrogen-mustard moiety becomes active and participates in alkylation of DNA or other cellular components. This causes DNA damage in rapidly dividing cancerous cells leading to cell death and ideally, tumor shrinkage.Estramustine is a derivative of estradiol with a nitrogen mustard moiety. This gives it alkylating properties. In vivo, the nitrogen mustard component is active and can alklyate DNA and other cellular components (such as tubulin components) of rapidly dividing cells. This causes DNA strandbreaks or misscoding events. This leads to apoptosis and cell death. Also, due to the drugs estrogen component, it can bind more selectively to active estrogen receptors."
801," May improve survival in patients with left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction. May be used to treat nephropathy, including diabetic nephropathy. Captopril is a potent, competitive inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), the enzyme responsible for the conversion of angiotensin I (ATI) to angiotensin II (ATII). ATII regulates blood pressure and is a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Captopril may be used in the treatment of hypertension.Captopril, an ACE inhibitor, antagonizes the effect of the RAAS. The RAAS is a homeostatic mechanism for regulating hemodynamics, water and electrolyte balance. During sympathetic stimulation or when renal blood pressure or blood flow is reduced, renin is released from the granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. In the blood stream, renin cleaves circulating angiotensinogen to ATI, which is subsequently cleaved to ATII by ACE. ATII increases blood pressure using a number of mechanisms. First, it stimulates the secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone travels to the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and collecting tubule of nephrons where it increases sodium and water reabsorption by increasing the number of sodium channels and sodium-potassium ATPases on cell membranes. Second, ATII stimulates the secretion of vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone or ADH) from the posterior pituitary gland. ADH stimulates further water reabsorption from the kidneys via insertion of aquaporin-2 channels on the apical surface of cells of the DCT and collecting tubules. Third, ATII increases blood pressure through direct arterial vasoconstriction. Stimulation of the Type 1 ATII receptor on vascular smooth muscle cells leads to a cascade of events resulting in myocyte contraction and vasoconstriction. In addition to these major effects, ATII induces the thirst response via stimulation of hypothalamic neurons. ACE inhibitors inhibit the rapid conversion of ATI to ATII and antagonize RAAS-induced increases in blood pressure. ACE (also known as kininase II) is also involved in the enzymatic deactivation of bradykinin, a vasodilator. Inhibiting the deactivation of bradykinin increases bradykinin levels and may sustain its effects by causing increased vasodilation and decreased blood pressure.There are two isoforms of ACE: the somatic isoform, which exists as a glycoprotein comprised of a single polypeptide chain of 1277; and the testicular isoform, which has a lower molecular mass and is thought to play a role in sperm maturation and binding of sperm to the oviduct epithelium. Somatic ACE has two functionally active domains, N and C, which arise from tandem gene duplication. Although the two domains have high sequence similarity, they play distinct physiological roles. The C-domain is predominantly involved in blood pressure regulation while the N-domain plays a role in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and proliferation. ACE inhibitors bind to and inhibit the activity of both domains, but have much greater affinity for and inhibitory activity against the C-domain. Captopril, one of the few ACE inhibitors that is not a prodrug, competes with ATI for binding to ACE and inhibits and enzymatic proteolysis of ATI to ATII. Decreasing ATII levels in the body decreases blood pressure by inhibiting the pressor effects of ATII as described in the Pharmacology section above. Captopril also causes an increase in plasma renin activity likely due to a loss of feedback inhibition mediated by ATII on the release of renin and/or stimulation of reflex mechanisms via baroreceptors. Captopril’s affinity for ACE is approximately 30,000 times greater than that of ATI."
802,"For the short-term treatment of insomnia.Zopiclone is a novel hypnotic agent used in the treatment of insomnia. Its mechanism of action is based on modulating benzodiazepine receptors. In addition to zopiclone's benzodiazepine pharmacological properties it also has some barbiturate-like properties.Zopiclone is a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic from the pyrazolopyrimidine class and is indicated for the short-term treatment of insomnia. While Zopiclone is a hypnotic agent with a chemical structure unrelated to benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or other drugs with known hypnotic properties, it interacts with the gamma-aminobutyric acid-benzodiazepine (GABABZ) receptor complex. Subunit modulation of the GABABZ receptor chloride channel macromolecular complex is hypothesized to be responsible for some of the pharmacological properties of benzodiazepines, which include sedative, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, and anticonvulsive effects in animal models. Zopiclone binds selectively to the brain alpha subunit of the GABA A omega-1 receptor.Zopiclone exerts its action by binding on the benzodiazepine receptor complex and modulation of the GABABZ receptor chloride channel macromolecular complex. Both zopiclone and benzodiazepines act indiscriminately at the benzodiazepine binding site on α1, α2, α3 and α5 GABAA containing receptors as full agonists causing an enhancement of the inhibitory actions of GABA to produce the therapeutic (hypnotic and anxiolytic) and adverse effects of zopiclone."
803,"For the treatment of galactorrhea due to hyperprolactinemia, prolactin-dependent menstrual disorders and infertility, prolactin-secreting adenomas, prolactin-dependent male hypogonadism, as adjunct therapy to surgery or radiotherapy for acromegaly or as monotherapy is special cases, as monotherapy in early Parksinsonian Syndrome or as an adjunct with levodopa in advanced cases with motor complications. Bromocriptine has also been used off-label to treat restless legs syndrome and neuroleptic malignant syndrome.Bromocriptine mesylate is a semisynthetic ergot alkaloid derivative with potent dopaminergic activity. It inhibits prolactin secretion and may be used to treat dysfunctions associated with hyperprolactinemia. Bromocriptine is also indicated for the management of signs and symptoms of Parkinsonian Syndrome, as well as the treatment of acromegaly. Bromocriptine has been associated with pulmonary fibrosis, and can also cause sustained suppression of somatotropin (growth hormone) secretion in some patients with acromegaly. In 1995, the FDA withdrew the approval of bromocriptine mesylate for the prevention of physiological lactation after finding that bromocriptine was not shown to be safe for use.[L43942,L43947] It continues to be used for the indications mentioned above.Bromocriptine stimulates centrally-located dopaminergic receptors resulting in a number of pharmacologic effects. Five dopamine receptor types from two dopaminergic subfamilies have been identified. The dopaminergic D1 receptor subfamily consists of D and D subreceptors, which are associated with dyskinesias. The dopaminergic D2 receptor subfamily consists of D, D and D subreceptors, which are associated with improvement of symptoms of movement disorders. Thus, agonist activity specific for D2 subfamily receptors, primarily D and D receptor subtypes, are the primary targets of dopaminergic antiparkinsonian agents. It is thought that postsynaptic D stimulation is primarily responsible for the antiparkinsonian effect of dopamine agonists, while presynaptic D stimulation confers neuroprotective effects. This semisynthetic ergot derivative exhibits potent agonist activity on dopamine D -receptors. It also exhibits agonist activity (in order of decreasing binding affinity) on 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), dopamine D, 5-HT, 5-HT, 5-HT, and 5-HT receptors, antagonist activity on α -adrenergic, α, α, and dopamine D receptors, partial agonist activity at receptor 5-HT, and inactivates dopamine D and 5-HT receptors. Parkinsonian Syndrome manifests when approximately 80% of dopaminergic activity in the nigrostriatal pathway of the brain is lost. As this striatum is involved in modulating the intensity of coordinated muscle activity (e.g. movement, balance, walking), loss of activity may result in dystonia (acute muscle contraction), Parkinsonism (including symptoms of bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, and flattened affect), akathesia (inner restlessness), tardive dyskinesia (involuntary muscle movements usually associated with long-term loss of dopaminergic activity), and neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which manifests when complete blockage of nigrostriatal dopamine occurs. High dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway of the brain causes hallucinations and delusions; these side effects of dopamine agonists are manifestations seen in patients with schizophrenia who have overractivity in this area of the brain. The hallucinogenic side effects of dopamine agonists may also be due to 5-HT agonism. The tuberoinfundibular pathway of the brain originates in the hypothalamus and terminates in the pituitary gland. In this pathway, dopamine inhibits lactotrophs in anterior pituitary from secreting prolactin. Increased dopaminergic activity in the tuberoinfundibular pathway inhibits prolactin secretion making bromocriptine an effective agent for treating disorders associated with hypersecretion of prolactin. Pulmonary fibrosis may be associated bromocriptine’s agonist activity at 5-HT and 5-HT receptors. The dopamine D receptor is a 7-transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor associated with G proteins. In lactotrophs, stimulation of dopamine D receptor causes inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, which decreases intracellular cAMP concentrations and blocks IP3-dependent release of Ca from intracellular stores. Decreases in intracellular calcium levels may also be brought about via inhibition of calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels, rather than via inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Additionally, receptor activation blocks phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK and decreases MAPK/ERK kinase phosphorylation. Inhibition of MAPK appears to be mediated by c-Raf and B-Raf-dependent inhibition of MAPK/ERK kinase. Dopamine-stimulated growth hormone release from the pituitary gland is mediated by a decrease in intracellular calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels rather than via adenylyl cyclase inhibition. Stimulation of dopamine D receptors in the nigrostriatal pathway leads to improvements in coordinated muscle activity in those with movement disorders."
804,"For the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis.Rifapentine is an antibiotic drug used in the treatment of tuberculosis. It inhibits DNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity in susceptible cells. Specifically, it interacts with bacterial RNA polymerase but does not inhibit the mammalian enzyme.Rifapentine is an antibiotic that inhibits DNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity in susceptible cells. Specifically, it interacts with bacterial RNA polymerase but does not inhibit the mammalian enzyme. It is bactericidal and has a very broad spectrum of activity against most gram-positive and gram-negative organisms (including Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and specifically Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Because of rapid emergence of resistant bacteria, use is restricted to treatment of mycobacterial infections and a few other indications. Rifampin is well absorbed when taken orally and is distributed widely in body tissues and fluids, including the CSF. It is metabolized in the liver and eliminated in bile and, to a much lesser extent, in urine, but dose adjustments are unnecessary with renal insufficiency.Rifapentine has shown higher bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities especially against intracellular bacteria growing in human monocyte-derived macrophages. Rifapentine inhibits DNA-dependent RNA polymerase in susceptible strains of M. tuberculosis. Rifapentine acts via the inhibition of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, leading to a suppression of RNA synthesis and cell death."
805,"Levetiracetam is indicated as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures in epileptic patients who are one month of age and older. Additionally, it is indicated as an adjunct in the treatment of myoclonic seizures in patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy who are 12 years of age and older, and in primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy who are 6 years of age and older.[L8606]    Levetiracetam is also available as an orally dissolvable tablet that is indicated as an adjunct in the treatment of partial onset seizures in patients with epilepsy who are 4 years of age and older and weigh more than 20kg.[L8609]Levetiracetam is a drug within the pyrrolidine class that is used to treat various types of seizures stemming from epileptic disorders. It was first approved for use in the United States in 1999 and is structurally and mechanistically unrelated to other anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs).[L8606,L8600,L8615] Levetiracetam possesses a wide therapeutic index[L8615,A185918] and little-to-no potential to produce, or be subject to, pharmacokinetic interactions[L8606,L8600,L8615] - these characteristics make it a desirable choice over other AEDs, a class of drugs notorious for having generally narrow therapeutic indexes and a propensity for involvement in drug interactions.[A185927]Levetiracetam appears to prevent seizure activity via the selective inhibition of hypersynchronized epileptiform burst firing without affecting normal neuronal transmission, though the exact mechanism through which this occurs is unclear.[L8606,L8615] The therapeutic index of levetiracetam is wide,[L8615,A185918] making it relatively unique amongst other anti-epileptic medications.    Anti-epileptic drugs, including levetiracetam, may increase the risk of suicidal ideation or behaviour - patients taking levetiracetam should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and behavioural abnormalities.[L8606,L8600,L8615]The exact mechanism through which levetiracetam exerts its anti-epileptic effects is unclear, but is thought to be unique amongst other anti-epileptic medications. Current knowledge suggests that levetiracetam’s binding to synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) is a key driver of its action. SV2A is a membrane-bound protein that is found on synaptic vesicles and is ubiquitous throughout the CNS[A12546] - it appears to play a role in vesicle exocytosis[L8606,L8615] and in the modulation of synaptic transmission by increasing the available amount of secretory vesicles available for neurotransmission.[A12552] Stimulation of pre-synaptic SV2A by levetiracetam may inhibit neurotransmitter release,[A12551] but this action does not appear to affect normal neurotransmission. This has led to the suggestion that levetiracetam exclusively modulates the function of SV2A only under pathophysiological conditions.[A12546] Levetiracetam and related analogues showed a correlation between affinity for SV2A and anti-epileptic potency, further suggesting that action at this site contributes to the anti-epileptic activity of the drug.[L8606,L8615]    Levetiracetam has also been shown to indirectly affect GABAergic neurotransmission (despite having no direct effect on GABAergic or glutamatergic receptors) and modulate ionic currents.[A12552] Similarly, levetiracetam has been shown in vitro to inhibit N-type calcium channels.[A16562] How, or even if, these actions are implicated in its anti-epileptic action have yet to be elucidated."

809,"For the treatment of primary and metastatic brain tumors as a component of combination chemotherapy in addition to appropriate surgical and/or radiotherapeutic procedures. Also used in combination with other agents as secondary therapy for the treatment of refractory or relapsed Hodgkin's disease.An alkylating agent of value against both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.Lomustine is an alkylating agent of the nitrosourea type. Lomustine and its metabolites interferes with the function of DNA and RNA. It is cell cycle&ndash;phase nonspecific. Cancers form when some cells within the body multiply uncontrollably and abnormally. These cells then spread and destroy nearby tissues. Lomustine acts by slowing this process down. It kills cancer cells by damaging the DNA (the genetic material inside the cells) and stops them from dividing.Lomustine is a highly lipophilic nitrosourea compound which undergoes hydrolysis in vivo to form reactive metabolites. These metabolites cause alkylation and cross-linking of DNA (at the O6 position of guanine-containing bases) and RNA, thus inducing cytotoxicity. Other biologic effects include inhibition of DNA synthesis and some cell cycle phase specificity. Nitrosureas generally lack cross-resistance with other alkylating agents. As lomustine is a nitrosurea, it may also inhibit several key processes such as carbamoylation and modification of cellular proteins."

Sparfloxacin exerts its antibacterial activity by inhibiting DNA gyrase, a bacterial topoisomerase. DNA gyrase is an essential enzyme which controls DNA topology and assists in DNA replication, repair, deactivation, and transcription.Sparfloxacin is a synthetic fluoroquinolone broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent in the same class as ofloxacin and norfloxacin. Sparfloxacin has in vitro activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms. Sparfloxacin exerts its antibacterial activity by inhibiting DNA gyrase, a bacterial topoisomerase. DNA gyrase is an essential enzyme which controls DNA topology and assists in DNA replication, repair, deactivation, and transcription. Quinolones differ in chemical structure and mode of action from (beta)-lactam antibiotics. Quinolones may, therefore, be active against bacteria resistant to (beta)-lactam antibiotics. Although cross-resistance has been observed between sparfloxacin and other fluoroquinolones, some microorganisms resistant to other fluoroquinolones may be susceptible to sparfloxacin. In vitro tests show that the combination of sparfloxacin and rifampin is antagonistic against Staphylococcus aureus.The bactericidal action of sparfloxacin results from inhibition of the enzymes topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV, which are required for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination."
811,"Indicated in the treatment of moderate to severe pain.Dezocine is a partial opiate drug and is used for pain management. Dezocine is a very effective alternative to fentanyl when administered during outpatient laparoscopy, although is associated with an increased incidence of postoperative nausea.Dezocine is a parenteral narcotic analgesic possessing both agonist and antagonist activity. It is similar to morphine with respect to analgesic potency and onset and duration of action. The narcotic antagonist activity is greater than that of pentazocine.Dezocine is a opioid analgesic drug of mixed agonist-antagonist type. It binds with stereospecific receptors at many sites within the central nervous system (CNS) to alter processes affecting both the perception of pain and the emotional response to pain. At least 2 of these types of receptors (mu and kappa) mediate analgesia. Mu receptors are widely distributed throughout the CNS, especially in the limbic system (frontal cortex, temporal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus), thalamus, striatum, hypothalamus, and midbrain as well as laminae I, II, IV, and V of the dorsal horn in the spinal cord. Kappa receptors are localized primarily in the spinal cord and in the cerebral cortex."
812,"An alternative medication for the treatment of acute otitis media caused by H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, or S. pneumoniae in patients with a history of type I penicillin hypersensitivity. Also for the treatment of pharyngitis and tonsillitis caused by susceptible Streptococcus pyogenes, as well as respiratory tract infections including acute maxillary sinusitis, acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, mild to moderate community-acquired pneuomia, Legionnaires' disease, and pertussis. Other indications include treatment of uncomplicated skin or skin structure infections, helicobacter pylori infection, duodenal ulcer disease, bartonella infections, early Lyme disease, and encephalitis caused by Toxoplasma gondii (in HIV infected patients in conjunction with pyrimethamine). Clarithromycin may also decrease the incidence of cryptosporidiosis, prevent the occurence of α-hemolytic (viridans group) streptococcal endocarditis, as well as serve as a primary prevention for Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) bacteremia or disseminated infections (in adults, adolescents, and children with advanced HIV infection). [L41695]Clarithromycin, a semisynthetic macrolide antibiotic derived from erythromycin, inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the bacterial 50S ribosomal subunit.

Clarithromycin may be bacteriostatic or bactericidal depending on the organism and drug concentration.Clarithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic whose spectrum of activity includes many gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, S. pneumoniae, and S. pyogenes) and gram-negative aerobic bacteria (Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis), many anaerobic bacteria, some mycobacteria, and some other organisms including Mycoplasma, Ureaplasma, Chlamydia, Toxoplasma, and Borrelia. Other aerobic bacteria that clarithromycin has activity against include C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae. Clarithromycin has an in-vitro activity that is similar or greater than that of erythromycin against erythromycin-susceptible organisms. Clarithromycin is usually bacteriostatic, but may be bactericidal depending on the organism and the drug concentration.Clarithromycin is first metabolized to 14-OH clarithromycin, which is active and works synergistically with its parent compound. Like other macrolides, it then penetrates bacteria cell wall and reversibly binds to domain V of the 23S ribosomal RNA of the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, blocking translocation of aminoacyl transfer-RNA and polypeptide synthesis. Clarithromycin also inhibits the hepatic microsomal CYP3A4 isoenzyme and P-glycoprotein, an energy-dependent drug efflux pump. "
813,"Ceftriaxone is used for the treatment of the infections (respiratory, skin, soft tissue, UTI, ENT) caused by susceptible organisms.[L15082] Organisms that are generally susceptible to ceftriaxone include S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes (group A beta-hemolytic streptococci), coagulase-negative staphylococci, Some Enterobacter spp, H. influenzae, N. gonorrhoeae, P. mirabilis, E. coli, Klebsiella spp, M. catarrhalis, B. burgdorferi, and some oral anaerobes.[A215582] Ceftriaxone is a broad-spectrum third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic.[A215582] It has a very long half-life compared to other cephalosporins and is high penetrable into the meninges[A215582], eyes[A215647], and inner ear[A215627]. Ceftriaxone has broader and stronger gram-negative coverage then first or second-generation cephalosporins, but worse activity against methicillin-susceptible S.aureus. Ceftriaxone is a commonly used antimicrobial due to its good activity against multi-drug resistant Enterobacteriaceae, its relatively safe adverse effect profile, and its long half-life which allows for the convenience of daily or twice-daily dosing.[A215582]Ceftriaxone is a cephalosporin/cephamycin beta-lactam antibiotic used in the treatment of bacterial infections caused by susceptible, usually gram-positive, organisms.[L15082] Ceftriaxone has <i>in vitro</i> activity against gram-positive aerobic, gram-negative aerobic, and anaerobic bacteria.[L15087] The bactericidal activity of ceftriaxone results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis and is mediated through ceftriaxone binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs).[T324] Ceftriaxone is stable against hydrolysis by a variety of beta-lactamases, including penicillinases, and cephalosporinases and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.[L15082] However, resistance to ceftriaxone usually occurs through beta-lactamase hydrolysis, altered PBPs, or reduced bacterial cell permeability.[T324] Ceftriaxone should not be mixed with or giving in the same IV line as diluents/products containing calcium as they may cause ceftriaxone to precipitate.[L15082] Ceftriaxone use may also cause biliary sludge or gallbladder pseudolithiasis.[L15082,A215602] Ceftriaxone works by inhibiting the mucopeptide synthesis in the bacterial cell wall.[T324,L15082] The beta-lactam moiety of ceftriaxone binds to carboxypeptidases, endopeptidases, and transpeptidases in the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. These enzymes are involved in cell-wall synthesis and cell division. Binding of ceftriaxone to these enzymes causes the enzyme to lose activity; therefore, the bacteria produce defective cell walls, causing cell death."

Fomepizole is a competitive inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase, the enzyme that catalyzes the initial steps in the metabolism of ethylene glycol and methanol to their toxic metabolites.Fomepizole is a competitive inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase, the enzyme that catalyzes the initial steps in the metabolism of ethylene glycol and methanol to their toxic metabolites. Ethylene glycol is first metabolized to glycoaldehyde which then undergoes further oxidation to glycolate, glyoxylate, and oxalate. Glycolate and oxalate are primarily responsible for metabolic acidosis and renal damage seen in ethylene glycol toxicity. {01}{03} Methanol is first metabolized to formaldehyde and then undergoes subsequent oxidation via formaldehyde dehydrogenase to become formic acid. It is formic acid that is primarily responsible for the metabolic acidosis and visual disturbances that are associated with methanol poisoning.Antizol (fomepizole) is a competitive inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase. Alcohol dehydrogenase catalyzes the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde. Alcohol dehydrogenase also catalyzes the initial steps in the metabolism of ethylene glycol and methanol to their toxic metabolites."
815,"Indicated in the treatment of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with ocular hypertension or open angle glaucoma.A beta-adrenergic antagonist effective for both beta-1 and beta-2 receptors. It is used as an antiarrhythmic, antihypertensive, and antiglaucoma agent.Metipranolol is a beta1 and beta2 (non-selective) adrenergic receptor-blocking agent that does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct myocardial depressant, or local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) activity. Metipranolol is indicated in the treatment of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma. Metipranolol, when applied topically to the eye, has the action of reducing elevated, as well as normal, intraocular pressure, whether or not accompanied by glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of glaucomatous visual field loss and optic nerve damage. Metipranolol reduces intraocular pressure with little or no effect on pupil size or accommodation in contrast to the miosis which cholinergic agents are known to produce.Although it is known that metipranolol binds the beta1 and beta2 adrenergic receptors, the mechanism of metipranolol's action is not known. It has no significant intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and has only weak local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) and myocardial depressant activity. It appears that the ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agents reduce aqueous humor production, as demonstrated by tonography and fluorophotometry. A slight increase in aqueous humor outflow may be an additional mechanism."
816,"For the short-term management of insomnia characterized by difficulty in falling asleep, frequent nocturnal awakenings, and/or early morning awakenings.A benzodiazepine with anticonvulsant, hypnotic, and muscle relaxant properties. It has been shown in some cases to be more potent than diazepam or nitrazepam.Estazolam, a triazolobenzodiazepine derivative, is an oral hypnotic agent with anticonvulsant, hypnotic, and muscle relaxant properties. It has been shown in some cases to be more potent than diazepam or nitrazepam.Benzodiazepines bind nonspecifically to benzodiazepine receptors, which affects affects muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, motor coordination, and memory. As benzodiazepine receptors are thought to be coupled to gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptors, this enhances the effects GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA receptor. Binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA to the site opens the chloride channel, resulting in a hyperpolarized cell membrane that prevents further excitation of the cell.

817,"Finasteride is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men with an enlarged prostate to improve symptoms, reduce the risk of acute urinary retention, and reduce the risk of the need for surgery including transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and prostatectomy.[L10565] A combination product with [tadalafil] is also used for the symptomatic treatment of BPH for up to 26 weeks.[L39439]    Finasteride is also indicated for the treatment of male pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia, hereditary alopecia, or common male baldness) in male patients.[L6235]Finasteride is a synthetic 4-azasteroid compound [L10565] and specific inhibitor of steroid Type II 5α-reductase, which is an intracellular enzyme that converts the androgen testosterone into 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It works in a similar fashion as [dutasteride], which is another 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor, by exerting antiandrogenic effects. Finasteride is an orally active drug that was first approved by the FDA in 1992 for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia to improve symptoms and reduce the risk for acute urinary retention or the need for surgical procedures.[L6244,L10565] In 1998, it was approved by the FDA to treat male pattern hair loss.[L6244] Finasteride is commonly marketed under the brand names Propecia and Proscar to be used aloneo or in combination with [doxazosin], an alpha-blocker.    Both benign prostatic hyperplasia and androgenic alopecia are androgen-dependent disorders that are characterized by _in situ_ high levels of DHT.[A178159] In the treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia, alpha-blockers such as [tamsulosin] and [terazosin] are also used. Compared to alpha-blockers that focus on providing the rapid relief of symptoms, 5α-reductase inhibitors aim to target the underlying disease by blocking the effects of the primary androgen involved in benign prostate hyperplasia and androgenic alopecia, thus reducing the risk for secondary complications while providing symptom control.[A2132]Finasteride is an antiandrogenic compound that works by suppressing the production of serum and intraprostatic dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in men via inhibiting the enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of DHT. The maximum effect of a rapid reduction in serum DHT concentration is expected to be observed 8 hours following administration of the first dose.[L10565] In a single man receiving a single oral dose of 5 mg finasteride for up to 4 years, there was a reduction in the serum DHT concentrations by approximately 70% and the median circulating level of testosterone increased by approximately 10-20% within the physiologic range. [L10565] In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, finasteride reduced intraprostatic DHT level by 91.4% but finasteride is not expected to decrease the DHT levels to castrate levels since circulating testosterone is also converted to DHT by the type 1 isoenzyme expressed in other tissues.[A2132] It is expected that DHT levels return to normal within 14 days upon discontinuation of the drug.[L6244] In a study of male patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia prior to prostatectomy, the treatment with finasteride resulted in an approximate 80% lower DHT content was measured in prostatic tissue removed at surgery compared to placebo.[L10565] While finasteride reduces the size of the prostate gland by 20%, this may not correlate well with improvement in symptoms.[A178273] The effects of finasteride are reported to be more pronounced in male patients with enlarged prostates (>25 mL) who are at the greatest risk of disease progression.[A2132]    In phase III clinical studies, oral administration of finasteride in male patients with male pattern hair loss promoted hair growth and prevented further hair loss by 66% and 83% of the subjects, respectively, which lasted during two years' treatment.[A178222] The incidences of these effects in treatment groups were significantly higher than that of the group receiving a placebo.[A178222] Following finasteride administration, the levels of DHT in the scalp skin was shown to be reduced by more than 60%, indicating that the DHT found in scalp is derived from both local DHT production and circulating DHT.[A178195] The effect of finasteride on scalp DHT is likely seen because of its effect on both local follicular DHT levels as well as serum DHT levels.[A178195]. There is evidence from early clinical observations and controlled studies that finasteride may reduce bleeding of prostatic origin.[A178183]Finasteride acts as a competitive and specific inhibitor of Type II 5α-reductase, a nuclear-bound steroid intracellular enzyme primarily located in the prostatic stromal cell that converts the androgen testosterone into the more active metabolite, 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT).[A2132] DHT is considered to be the primary androgen playing a role in the development and enlargement of the prostate gland. It serves as the hormonal mediator for the hyperplasia upon accumulation within the prostate gland.[A178270] DHT displays a higher affinity towards androgen receptors in the prostate gland compared to testosterone[T28] and by acting on the androgen receptors, DHT modulates genes that are responsible for cell proliferation.[A178279] Responsible for the production of DHT together with type I 5α-reductase, the type II 5α-reductase isozyme is primarily found in the prostate, seminal vesicles, epididymides, and hair follicles as well as liver.[L6235] Although finasteride is 100-fold more selective for type II 5α-reductase than for the type I isoenzyme,[A178183] chronic treatment with this drug may have some effect on type I 5α-reductase, which is predominantly expressed in sebaceous glands of most regions of skin, including the scalp, and liver. It is proposed that the type I 5α-reductase and type II 5α-reductase is responsible for the production of one-third and two-thirds of circulating DHT, respectively.     The mechanism of action of Finasteride is based on its preferential inhibition of Type II 5α-reductase through the formation of a stable complex with the enzyme _in vitro_ and _in vivo_.[L10565] Finasteride works selectively, where it preferentially displays a 100-fold selectivity for the human Type II 5α-reductase over type I enzyme.[L6235] Inhibition of Type II 5α-reductase blocks the peripheral conversion of testosterone to DHT, resulting in significant decreases in serum and tissue DHT concentrations, minimal to moderate increase in serum testosterone concentrations, and substantial increases in prostatic testosterone concentrations. As DHT appears to be the principal androgen responsible for stimulation of prostatic growth, a decrease in DHT concentrations will result in a decrease in prostatic volume (approximately 20-30% after 6-24 months of continued therapy). It is suggested that increased levels of DHT can lead to potentiated transcription of prostaglandin D2, which promotes the proliferation of prostate cancer cells.[A178189] In men with androgenic alopecia, the mechanism of action has not been fully determined, but finasteride has shown to decrease scalp DHT concentration to the levels found in the hairy scalp, reduce serum DHT, increase hair regrowth, and slow hair loss. Another study suggests that finasteride may work to reduce bleeding of prostatic origin by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the prostate, leading to atrophy and programmed cell death.[A178183] This may bestow the drug therapeutic benefits in patients idiopathic prostatic bleeding, bleeding during anticoagulation, or bleeding after instrumentation.[A178183]"
818,"Anastrozole is indicated as adjunct therapy in the treatment of hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer in postmenopausal women, and as a first-line treatment for hormone receptor-positive (or hormone receptor-unknown) locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women.[L8863] It may also be used in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women who experience disease progression despite treatment with [tamoxifen].[L8866,L8863] Anastrozole is a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (AI), similar to [letrozole], used to decrease circulating estrogen levels in the treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogen-responsive breast cancer.[L8863] Anastrozole is also related to [exemestane], a steroidal AI, but its non-steroidal nature provides stark advantages including a lack of steroid-associated adverse effects such as weight gain and acne.[A186865] Aromatase inhibitors, including anastrozole, have become endocrine drugs of choice in the treatment of postmenopausal breast cancer due to a more favourable efficacy and adverse effect profile as compared to earlier estrogen receptor modulators such as [tamoxifen].[A186877,A186955]    Anastrozole was first approved for use in the United States in 1995.[L8863]Anastrozole prevents the conversion of adrenal androgens (e.g. [testosterone]) to estrogen in peripheral and tumour tissues. As the growth of many breast cancers is stimulated and/or maintained by the presence of estrogen, anastrozole helps to treat these cancers by decreasing the levels of circulating estrogens.[L8869,A186958] Anastrozole has a relatively long duration of action allowing for once daily dosing - serum estradiol is reduced by approximately 70% within 24 hours of beginning therapy with 1mg once daily, and levels remain suppressed for up to 6 days following cessation of therapy.[L8863]     The incidence of ischemic cardiovascular events was increased during anastrozole therapy and patients with pre-existing ischemic heart disease should consider the risks and benefits of anastrozole before beginning therapy. Anastrozole has also been reported to decrease spine and hip bone mineral density (BMD), so consideration should be given to monitoring of BMD in patients receiving long-term therapy.[L8863,A186955]Anastrazole exerts its anti-estrogenic effects via selective and competitive inhibition of the aromatase enzyme found predominantly in the adrenal glands, liver, and fatty tissues.[A186877] Many breast cancers are hormone receptor-positive, meaning their growth is stimulated and/or maintained by the presence of hormones such as estrogen or progesterone.[L8863] In postmenopausal women, estrogen is primarily derived from the conversion of adrenally-produced androgens into estrogens by the aromatase enzyme - by competitively inhibiting the biosynthesis of estrogen at these enzymes, anastrozole effectively suppresses circulating estrogen levels and, subsequently, the growth of hormone receptor-positive tumours.[A186877,A186958]"
819,"For use, along with appropriate supportive measures, for the management of the fulminant hypermetabolism of skeletal muscle characteristic of malignant hyperthermia crises in patients of all ages. Also used preoperatively, and sometimes postoperatively, to prevent or attenuate the development of clinical and laboratory signs of malignant hyperthermia in individuals judged to be malignant hyperthermia susceptible.Chemically, dantrolene is a hydantoin derivative, but does not exhibit antiepileptic activity like other hydantoin derivates such as phenytoin.Dantrolene is classified as a direct-acting skeletal muscle relaxant. It is currently the only specific and effective treatment for malignant hyperthermia. In isolated nerve-muscle preparation, Dantrium has been shown to produce relaxation by affecting the contractile response of the muscle at a site beyond the myoneural junction. In skeletal muscle, Dantrium dissociates excitation-contraction coupling, probably by interfering with the release of Ca2+from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In the anesthetic-induced malignant hyperthermia syndrome, evidence points to an intrinsic abnormality of skeletal muscle tissue. In selected humans, it has been postulated that &ldquo;triggering agents&rdquo; (e.g.,general anesthetics and depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents) produce a change within the cell which results in an elevated myoplasmic calcium. This elevated myoplasmic calcium activates acute cellular catabolic processes that cascade to the malignant hyperthermia crisis. It is hypothesized that addition of Dantrium to the &ldquo;triggered&rdquo; malignant hyperthermic muscle cell reestablishes a normal level of ionized calcium in the myoplasm.Dantrolene depresses excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle by binding to the ryanodine receptor 1, and decreasing intracellular calcium concentration. Ryanodine receptors mediate the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, an essential step in muscle contraction."
820,"Rifaximin has multiple indications by the FDA: for the treatment of patients (≥12 years of age) with traveller's diarrhea caused by noninvasive strains of Escherichia coli; for the reduction of overt hepatic encephalopathy recurrence in patients ≥18 years of age; and in May 2015 it was approved for irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) treatment in adult men and women. Rifaximin is a semisynthetic, rifamycin-based non-systemic antibiotic, meaning that the drug will not pass the gastrointestinal wall into the circulation as is common for other types of orally administered antibiotics. It has multiple indications and is used in treatment of traveller's diarrhea caused by E. coli; reduction in risk of overt hepatic encephalopathy recurrence; as well as diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) in adult women and men. It is marketed under the brand name Xifaxan by Salix Pharmaceuticals.Rifaximin is a structural analog of rifampin and a non-systemic, gastrointestinal site-specific antibiotic. This non-systemic property of the drug is due to the addition of a pyridoimidazole ring, which renders it non-absorbable. Rifaximin acts by inhibiting bacterial ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis and contributes to restore intestinal microflora imbalance. Other studies have also shown rifaximin to be an pregnane X receptor (PXR) activator. As PXR is responsible for inhibiting the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-kappa B (NF-κB) and is inhibited in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rifaximin was proven to be effective for the treatment of IBS-D.Rifaximin acts by inhibiting RNA synthesis in susceptible bacteria by binding to the beta-subunit of bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-dependent ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase enzyme. This binding blocks translocation, which stops transcription."
821,"Ketamine is indicated as an anesthetic agent for recommended diagnostic and surgical procedures.If the surgical procedure involves visceral pain, it should be supplemented with an agent that obtunds visceral pain. Ketamine can be used for induction of anesthesia prior other general anesthetic agents and as a supplement of low potency agents.[L1336, FDA label]    Reports have indicated a potential use of ketamine as a therapeutic tool for the management of depression when administered in lower doses.[A31873] These reports have increased the interest for ketamine in this area and several clinical trials are launched for this indication.[L1337, A31874]Ketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist with a potent anesthetic effect.[A31869] It was developed in 1963 as a replacement for phencyclidine (PCP) by Calvin Stevens at Parke Davis Laboratories. It started being used for veterinary purposes in Belgium and in 1964 was proven that compared to PCP, it produced minor hallucinogenic effects and shorter psychotomimetic effects. It was FDA approved in 1970, and from there, it has been used as an anesthetic for children or patients undergoing minor surgeries but mainly for veterinary purposes.[L1332]Ketamine is a rapid-acting general anesthetic producing an anesthetic state characterized by profound analgesia, normal pharyngeal-laryngeal reflexes, normal or slightly enhanced skeletal muscle tone, cardiovascular and respiratory stimulation, and occasionally a transient and minimal respiratory depression. The anesthetic state produced by Ketamine has been termed as ""dissociative anesthesia"" in that it appears to selectively interrupt association pathways of the brain before producing somesthetic sensory blockade. It may selectively depress the thalamoneocortical system before significantly obtunding the more ancient cerebral centers and pathways (reticular-activating and limbic systems).[A2180]    Ketamine enhances descending inhibiting serotoninergic pathways and can exert antidepressive effects. These effects are seen in concentrations ten times lower than the needed concentration for anesthetic proposes. The effect of ketamine can be described as analgesic by the prevention of central sensitization in dorsal horn neurons as well as by the inhibition on the synthesis of nitric oxide. Ketamine can present cardiovascular changes and bronchodilatation.[A31879]Ketamine interacts with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, opioid receptors, monoaminergic receptors, muscarinic receptors and voltage sensitive Ca ion channels. Unlike other general anaesthetic agents, ketamine does not interact with GABA receptors.[A2187]"

823,"For the treatment of bronchospasm due to asthma, emphysema and chronic bronchitis.Aminophylline is a drug combination that contains theophylline and ethylenediamine in a 2:1 ratio. Once in the body, theophylline is released and acts as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, adenosine receptor blocker, and histone deacetylase activator. Similar to other theophyllines, aminophylline is indicated for the treatment of lung diseases such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, and COPD. The majority of aminophylline medications are discontinued and the remaining medications on the market are in short supply.Aminophylline is the ethylenediamine salt of theophylline. Theophylline stimulates the CNS, skeletal muscles, and cardiac muscle. It relaxes certain smooth muscles in the bronchi, produces diuresis, and causes an increase in gastric secretion.Aminophylline is the ethylenediamine salt of theophylline. After ingestion, theophylline is released from aminophylline, and theophylline relaxes the smooth muscle of the bronchial airways and pulmonary blood vessels and reduces airway responsiveness to histamine, methacholine, adenosine, and allergen. Theophylline competitively inhibits type III and type IV phosphodiesterase (PDE), the enzyme responsible for breaking down cyclic AMP in smooth muscle cells, possibly resulting in bronchodilation. Theophylline also binds to the adenosine A2B receptor and blocks adenosine mediated bronchoconstriction. In inflammatory states, theophylline activates histone deacetylase to prevent transcription of inflammatory genes that require the acetylation of histones for transcription to begin."
824,"Quetiapine is used in the symptomatic treatment of schizophrenia.  In addition, it may be used for the management of acute manic or mixed episodes in patients with bipolar I disorder, as a monotherapy or combined with other drugs. It may be used to manage depressive episodes in bipolar disorder. In addition to the above indications, quetiapine is used in combination with antidepressant drugs for the treatment of major depression.[L8546]    Some off-label uses for this drug include the management of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder, and psychosis associated with Parkinson's disease.[A185438,A185447,T685]  Initially approved by the FDA in 1997, quetiapine is a second-generation atypical antipsychotic used in schizophrenia, major depression, and bipolar disorder.[L8546] Quetiapine demonstrates a high level of therapeutic efficacy and low risk of adverse effects during long-term treatment. It is well-tolerated and a suitable option for some patients with high sensitivity to other drugs, such as [clozapine] and [olanzapine].[A2189]Quetiapine improves the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia and major depression by acting on various neurotransmitter receptors, such as the serotonin and dopamine receptors. In bipolar disorder, it improves both depressive and manic symptoms.[A2189,A185441,A185444]    **A note on suicidality in young patients and administration in the elderly**    Quetiapine can cause suicidal thinking or behavior in children and adolescents and should not be given to children under 10 years of age. It is important to monitor for suicidality if this drug is given to younger patients. In addition, this drug is not indicated for the treatment of psychosis related to dementia due to an increased death rate in elderly patients taking this drug.[L8546]Although the mechanism of action of quetiapine is not fully understood, several proposed mechanisms exist. In schizophrenia, its actions could occur from the antagonism of dopamine type 2 (D2) and serotonin 2A (5HT2A) receptors. In bipolar depression and major depression, quetiapine's actions may be attributed to the binding of this drug or its metabolite to the norepinephrine transporter. Additional effects of quetiapine, including somnolence, orthostatic hypotension, and anticholinergic effects, may result from the antagonism of H1 receptors, adrenergic α1 receptors, and muscarinic M1 receptors, respectively.[A2189,A185438,L8546]"
825,"Enoxaparin is indicated for the prevention of ischemic complications in unstable angina and in non Q-wave myocardial infarction; it is indicated in conjunction with percutaneous intervention and/or other treatment for the management of acute ST elevation myocardial infarction. [L31393]    Enoxaparin is also indicated in the prophylaxis of DVT in abdominal surgery, hip replacement, knee replacement, or medical patients with severely restricted mobility during acute illness. Additionally, enoxaparin is indicated for the inpatient treatment of DVT with or without pulmonary embolism and the treatment of outpatient DVT without pulmonary embolism.[L31393]  Enoxaparin is a common low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) used in the prevention and management of various thromboembolic disorders. Initially approved by the FDA in 1993, it is administered by a subcutaneous or intravenous injection and marketed by several pharmaceutical companies.[L31393] Enoxaparin markedly reduces the incidence of venous thromboembolism in hospitalized patients when compared to unfractionated [heparin], without increasing the risk of serious bleeding.[A228178,A228313]This drug has an immediate onset of action.[L31468] Enoxaparin increases Thrombin Time (TT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), preventing and reducing thromboembolic complications such as DVT, pulmonary embolism, and ischemic cardiac complications.[A228128] Administered at 1.5 mg/kg subcutaneously in a pharmacodynamic study, enoxaparin led to a higher ratio of anti-Factor Xa to anti-Factor IIa activity (mean ±SD, 14.0±3.1) (based on areas under anti-Factor activity versus time curves) when compared to that of heparin (mean ±SD, 1.22±0.13). Increases in the TT and aPTT were 1.8 times those of the control group.[L31393]  Enoxaparin at 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours led to aPTT values of 45 seconds or less in most patients. Average aPTT prolongation time on Day 1 was approximately 16% higher than on Day 4 of enoxaparin therapy.[L31393]    Caution is advised during treatment with enoxaparin - the risk of hemorrhage and thrombocytopenia is increased. In pregnant women with prosthetic mechanic heart valves, the risk of thromboembolism is increased.[L31393]   Enoxaparin binds to antithrombin III, a serine protease inhibitor, forming a complex that irreversibly inactivates factor Xa, which is frequently used to monitor anticoagulation in the clinical setting.[A228318] Following factor Xa inactivation, enoxaparin is released and binds to other anti-thrombin molecules. Factor IIa (thrombin) is directly inhibited by enoxaparin, however with less potency than unfractionated heparin (UFH). [A188051] Due to the cascade of effects resulting from enoxaparin binding, thrombin is unable to convert fibrinogen to fibrin and form a clot, preventing thromboembolic events.      "
826,"For the treatment and management of opiate dependence. It is sometimes used to treat severe pain in terminal patients.Levacetylmethadol is a narcotic analgesic with a long onset and duration of action. It is used mainly in the treatment of narcotic dependence.     Levacetylmethadol was withdrawn from use in the European Union due to its high risk of QT interval prolongation. The production of levacetylmethadol in the US has ceased as well.[L44052,T862]Levomethadyl acetate (also known as LAAM) is a synthetic synthetic opioid analgesic with multiple actions quantitatively similar to those as morphine, the most prominent of which involve the central nervous system and organs composed of smooth muscle. However, levomethadyl acetate is more active and more toxic than morphine. The principal actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation and detoxification or temporary maintenance in narcotic addiction. In this respect, the drug is similar to Methadone and also has structural similarities to it. The levomethadyl acetate abstinence syndrome, although qualitatively similar to that of morphine, differs in that the onset is slower, the course is more prolonged, and the symptoms are less severe.Opiate receptors (Mu, Kappa, Delta) are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as both positive and negative regulators of synaptic transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine and noradrenaline is inhibited. Opioids also inhibit the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin and glucagon. Levomethadyl acetate effectively opens calcium-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channels (OP1 receptor agonist), resulting in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability."
827,"Encainide is a class Ic antiarrhythmic agent which was used for management of irregular heartbeats, such as atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. All drug products containing encainide hydrochloride. Encainide hydrochloride, formerly marketed as Enkaid capsules, was associated with increased death rates in patients who had asymptomatic heart rhythm abnormalities after a recent heart attack. The manufacturer of Enkaid capsules voluntarily withdrew the product from the US market on December 16, 1991.Used to treat irregular heartbeats, encainide decreases excitability, conduction velocity, and automaticity as a result of slowed atrial, atrioventricular (AV) nodal, His-Purkinje, and intraventricular conduction. It causes a slight but significant prolongation of refractory periods in these tissues. The greatest effect is on the His-Purkinje system. Encainide decreases the rate of rise of the action potential without markedly affecting its duration.Encainide is a sodium channel blocker, binding to voltage gated sodium channels. It stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses. Ventricular excitability is depressed and the stimulation threshold of the ventricle is increased during diastole."
828,"Used in the treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma and cancer of the lung, ovarian, and breast. Abraxane® is specfically indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer and locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.Paclitaxel is a chemotherapeutic agent marketed under the brand name Taxol among others. Used as a treatment for various cancers, paclitaxel is a mitotic inhibitor that was first isolated in 1971 from the bark of the Pacific yew tree which contains endophytic fungi that synthesize paclitaxel. It is available as an intravenous solution for injection and the newer formulation contains albumin-bound paclitaxel marketed under the brand name Abraxane.Paclitaxel is a taxoid antineoplastic agent indicated as first-line and subsequent therapy for the treatment of advanced carcinoma of the ovary, and other various cancers including breast cancer. Paclitaxel is a novel antimicrotubule agent that promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilizes microtubules by preventing depolymerization. This stability results in the inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic cellular functions. In addition, paclitaxel induces abnormal arrays or ""bundles"" of microtubules throughout the cell cycle and multiple asters of microtubules during mitosis.Paclitaxel interferes with the normal function of microtubule growth. Whereas drugs like colchicine cause the depolymerization of microtubules in vivo, paclitaxel arrests their function by having the opposite effect; it hyper-stabilizes their structure. This destroys the cell's ability to use its cytoskeleton in a flexible manner. Specifically, paclitaxel binds to the &beta; subunit of tubulin. Tubulin is the ""building block"" of mictotubules, and the binding of paclitaxel locks these building blocks in place. The resulting microtubule/paclitaxel complex does not have the ability to disassemble. This adversely affects cell function because the shortening and lengthening of microtubules (termed dynamic instability) is necessary for their function as a transportation highway for the cell. Chromosomes, for example, rely upon this property of microtubules during mitosis. Further research has indicated that paclitaxel induces programmed cell death (apoptosis) in cancer cells by binding to an apoptosis stopping protein called Bcl-2 (B-cell leukemia 2) and thus arresting its function."
829,"For treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)In 2005, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) withdrew approval for pemoline. In March 2005, Abbott Laboratories (Cylert marketer) had discontinued the production of Cylert arguing economic reasons.Pemoline belongs to the group of medicines called central nervous system (CNS) stimulants. It is used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Pemoline stimulates the brain, probably by affecting neurotransmitters, the chemicals in the brain that nerves use to communicate with each other."
830,"In 1995 it became the first protease inhibitor approved by the FDA, followed shortly by ritonavir in 1996, and remains in clinical use today due to a relatively benign adverse effect profile as compared to other antiretroviral therapies.[A214382] While its efficacy was initially limited by exceptionally poor oral bioavailability (approximately 4%),[L3450] its current indications require the co-administration of ritonavir - a potent enzyme inhibitor - that increases the bioavailability and subsequent serum concentrations of saquinavir, thus dramatically improving antiviral activity.[A214382,L3450,L14351]Saquinavir exerts its antiviral activity by inhibiting an enzyme critical for the HIV-1 viral lifecycle.[L3450] Like other protease inhibitors, saquinavir has a propensity for participating in drug interactions - use caution when administering saquinavir to patients maintained on other pharmaceutical agents as pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions are common.[L3450] Saquinavir is known to increase the QTc-interval in otherwise healthy individuals, and should therefore be used with caution in patients maintained on other QTc-prolonging medications or for whom prolongation of the QTc-interval may be of particular consequence (e.g. patients with pre-existing heart disease).[L3450] Careful and regular monitoring of patient bloodwork is recommended, as saquinavir has been associated with the development of metabolic complications (e.g. diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia) and worsening of pre-existing liver disease.[L3450]The HIV lifecycle is comprised of 3 distinct stages: assembly, involving creation and packaging of essential viral components; budding, wherein the viral particle crosses the host cell plasma membrane and forms a lipid envelope; and maturation, wherein the viral particle alters its structure and becomes infectious.[A191712] At the center of this lifecycle is the Gag polyprotein which, along with the products of its proteolysis, coordinate these stages and function as the major structural proteins of the virus. The HIV-1 protease enzyme, a dimeric aspartic protease, is the enzyme responsible for cleaving the Gag polyprotein and thus plays a critical role in many aspects of the HIV viral lifecycle.[A191712]    Saquinavir is an inhibitor of the HIV-1 protease enzyme.[L3450] Its design is based on the ""peptidomimetic"" principle, wherein the molecule contains a hydroxyethylene scaffold that mimics the normal peptide linkage (cleaved by HIV protease) but which itself cannot be cleaved.[A191757] By preventing HIV-1 protease activity, and thus the proteolysis of the Gag polyprotein, saquinavir results in the production of immature, non-infectious viral particles."
831,"Metoclopramide in the oral tablet form is used for symptomatic treatment of both acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis, in addition to the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in patients who have failed to respond to traditional therapy.[L8414] A nasal spray formulation is also indicated to treat adults with acute, recurrent diabetic gastroparesis.[L14381]    In the intravenous injection form, it is indicated for the above conditions as well as for the prevention of vomiting that may follow emetogenic chemotherapy or nausea and vomiting after surgery. Intravenous metoclopramide facilitates intubation of the small bowel and stimulates gastric emptying and barium flow in patients who require radiological examination of the stomach or small intestine.  In some cases, the delay of gastrointestinal emptying interferes with the radiographic visualization of the gastrointestinal tract, and metoclopramide is used to facilitate emptying in these cases, allowing for adequate diagnostic visualization.[L8417]    Some off-label uses of metoclopramide include the management of radiation-induced nausea and vomiting, gastric bezoars, intractable hiccups, and migraine pain.[A184961,A184964,A184967,A40105]Diabetic gastroparesis is a condition that causes frequent nausea and vomiting, which has a negative impact on quality of life and poses a significant burden on the healthcare system.[A184934] Metoclopramide is a dopamine antagonist used to treat nausea and vomiting that may be associated with diabetic gastroparesis in addition to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). It can also be used to prevent nausea or vomiting associated with chemotherapy or certain surgical or diagnostic procedures.[L8417]     One unique property of this drug is that it does not increase gastric acid secretion. It is available in the oral tablet form or in solution, and can also be administered through the intravenous route.[T683] Metoclopramide was initially approved by the FDA in 1980.[A184922]Metoclopramide increases gastric emptying by decreasing lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure. It also exerts effects on the area postrema of the brain, preventing and relieving the symptoms of nausea and vomiting. In addition, this drug increases gastrointestinal motility without increasing biliary, gastric, or pancreatic secretions.[T683,L8414,L8417]    Because of its antidopaminergic activity, metoclopramide can cause symptoms of tardive dyskinesia (TD), dystonia, and akathisia, and should therefore not be administered for longer than 12 weeks.[A184886,L8414]Metoclopramide causes antiemetic effects by inhibiting dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT3 receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) located in the area postrema of the brain.[A184880,T683] Administration of this drug leads to prokinetic effects via inhibitory actions on presynaptic and postsynaptic D2 receptors, agonism of serotonin 5-HT4 receptors, and antagonism of muscarinic receptor inhibition. This action enhances the release of acetylcholine, causing increased lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and gastric tone, accelerating gastric emptying and transit through the gut. Metoclopramide antagonizes the dopamine D2 receptors. Dopamine exerts relaxant effect on the gastrointestinal tract through binding to muscular D2 receptors.[A184880,T683,L8414]"
832,"Dexamethasone and [ciprofloxacin] otic suspension is indicated for bacterial infections with inflammation in acute otitis media and acute otitis externa.[L10698] Intramuscular and intravenous injections are indicated for a number of endocrine, rheumatic, collagen, dermatologic, allergic, ophthalmic, gastrointestinal, respiratory, hematologic, neoplastic, edematous, and other conditions.[L10701] Oral tablets are indicated for the treatment of multiple myeloma.[L10710] An intravitreal implant is indicated for some forms of macular edema and non-infectious posterior uveitis affecting the posterior of the eye.[L10719] Various ophthalmic formulations are indicated for inflammatory conditions of the eye.[L10704,L10707,L10713,L10716,L10722,L10725]Dexamethasone, or MK-125, is a corticosteroid fluorinated at position 9 used to treat endocrine, rheumatic, collagen, dermatologic, allergic, ophthalmic, gastrointestinal, respiratory, hematologic, neoplastic, edematous, and other conditions.[L10701] Developed in 1957, it is structurally similar to other corticosteroids like [hydrocortisone] and [prednisolone].[A188724]    Dexamethasone was granted FDA approval on 30 October 1958.[L10695] In a press release for the Randomized Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy (RECOVERY) trial on 16 June 2020, dexamethasone was recommended for use in COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory symptoms. Dexamethasone reduced deaths by approximately one third in patients requiring ventilation and by one fifth in those requiring oxygen.[L14318]Corticosteroids bind to the glucocorticoid receptor, inhibiting pro-inflammatory signals, and promoting anti-inflammatory signals.[A187463] Dexamethasone's duration of action varies depending on the route.[L10698,L10701,L10704,L10707,L10710,L10713,L10716,L10719,L10722,L10725] Corticosteroids have a wide therapeutic window as patients may require doses that are multiples of what the body naturally produces.[A187463] Patients taking corticosteroids should be counselled regarding the risk of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression and increased susceptibility to infections.[A187463]The short term effects of corticosteroids are decreased vasodilation and permeability of capillaries, as well as decreased leukocyte migration to sites of inflammation.[A187463] Corticosteroids binding to the glucocorticoid receptor mediates changes in gene expression that lead to multiple downstream effects over hours to days.[A187463]    Glucocorticoids inhibit neutrophil apoptosis and demargination; they inhibit phospholipase A2, which decreases the formation of arachidonic acid derivatives; they inhibit NF-Kappa B and other inflammatory transcription factors; they promote anti-inflammatory genes like interleukin-10.[A187463]    Lower doses of corticosteroids provide an anti-inflammatory effect, while higher doses are immunosuppressive.[A187463] High doses of glucocorticoids for an extended period bind to the mineralocorticoid receptor, raising sodium levels and decreasing potassium levels.[A187463]"
833,"Levodopa on its own is formulated as an oral inhalation powder indicated for intermittent treatment of off episodes in Parkinson's patients who are already being treated with carbidopa and levodopa[FDA Label]. Levodopa is most commonly formulated as an oral tablet with a peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor indicated for treatment of Parkinson's disease, post-encephalitic parkinsonism, and symptomatic parkinsonism following carbon monoxide intoxication or manganese intoxication[F4579].Levodopa is a prodrug of dopamine that is administered to patients with Parkinson's due to its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier[Label]. Levodopa can be metabolised to dopamine on either side of the blood-brain barrier and so it is generally administered with a dopa decarboxylase inhibitor like carbidopa to prevent metabolism until after it has crossed the blood-brain barrier[Label,A177781]. Once past the blood-brain barrier, levodopa is metabolized to dopamine and supplements the low endogenous levels of dopamine to treat symptoms of Parkinson's[Label]. The first developed drug product that was approved by the FDA was a levodopa and carbidopa combined product called Sinemet that was approved on May 2, 1975[A177781,L6133].Levodopa is able to cross the blood-brain barrier while dopamine is not[FDA Label,F4579]. The addition of a peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor prevents the conversion of levodopa to dopamine in the periphery so that more levodopa can reach the blood-brain barrier[Label,F4579]. Once past the blood-brain barrier, levodopa is converted to dopamine by aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase[Label,F4579].Levodopa by various routes crosses the blood brain barrier, is decarboxylated to form dopamine[Label,F4579]. This supplemental dopamine performs the role that endogenous dopamine cannot due to a decrease of natural concentrations and stimulates dopaminergic receptors[Label,F4579]."
834,"Sevoflurane is used for the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia in adult and pediatric patients for inpatient and outpatient surgery.[L42340]Sevoflurane is an ether inhalation anesthetic agent used to induce and maintain general anesthesia.[L42340] It is a volatile, non-flammable compound with a low solubility profile and blood/gas partition coefficient.[L42340] Sevoflurane was patented in 1972, was approved for clinical use in Japan in 1990, and approved by the FDA in 1996.[A249885] Sevoflurane is three times more potent than [desflurane], but has lower potency compared to [halothane] and [isoflurane]. Unlike other volatile anesthetics, sevoflurane has a pleasant odor and does not irritate the airway. The hemodynamic and respiratory depressive effects of sevoflurane are well tolerated, and most patients receiving this anesthetic agent present little toxicity.[A249910] Therefore, it can be used for inhalational induction in adults and children for a wide variety of anesthetic procedures.[A249885]Sevoflurane induces muscle relaxation and reduces sensitivity by altering tissue excitability with a fast onset of action. It does so by decreasing the extent of gap junction-mediated cell-cell coupling and altering the activity of the channels that underlie the action potential.[A249905] Compared to [halothane] and [isoflurane], sevoflurane has a shorter emergence time, as well as a shorter time to first analgesia.[L42340] To reach an equilibrium between alveolar and arterial partial pressure, only a minimal amount of sevoflurane needs to be dissolved in blood.[L42340] The use of sevoflurane can increase the risk of renal injury, respiratory depression, and QT prolongation. Also, it can lead to malignant hyperthermia, perioperative hyperkalemia, and pediatric neurotoxicity. Episodes of severe bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported in pediatric patients with Down Syndrome given sevoflurane. Sevoflurane anesthesia may impair the performance of activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving or operating machinery.[L42340]The precise mechanism of action of sevoflurane has not been fully elucidated. Like other halogenated inhalational anesthetics, sevoflurane induces anesthesia by binding to ligand-gated ion channels and blocking CNS neurotransmission. It has been suggested that inhaled anesthetics enhance inhibitory postsynaptic channel activity by binding GABA and glycine receptors, and inhibit excitatory synaptic channel activity by binding nicotinic acetylcholine, serotonin, and glutamate receptors.[A249890] Sevoflurane has an effect on several ionic currents, including the hyperpolarisation-activated cation current (I ), the T-type and L-type Ca currents (I and I ), the slowly activating delayed rectifier K currents (I ), and the Na /Ca exchange current (I ).[A249895] This ability to modulate ion channel activity can also regulate cardiac excitability and contractility.[A249895]"
835,"Aripiprazole is indicated for the treatment of acute manic and mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, irritability associated with autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and Tourette's disorder.[L45859] It is also used as an adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder.[L45859 An injectable formulation of aripiprazole is indicated for agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar mania.[L45859] Finally, an extended-release, bimonthly injection formulation of aripiprazole is indicated for the treatment of adult schizophrenia and maintenance therapy for adult bipolar I disorder.[L46203]Aripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic orally indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar I, major depressive disorder, irritability associated with autism, and Tourette's.[L45859] It is also indicated as an injection for agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar mania.[L45859] Aripiprazole exerts its effects through agonism of dopaminergic and 5-HT1A receptors and antagonism of alpha-adrenergic and 5-HT2A receptors.[L45859,A4393] Aripiprazole was given FDA approval on November 15, 2002.[L6136]Aripiprazole exhibits high affinity for dopamine D2 and D3, serotonin 5-HT1a and 5-HT2a receptors (Ki values of 0.34 nM, 0.8 nM, 1.7 nM, and 3.4 nM, respectively), moderate affinity for dopamine D4, serotonin 5-HT2c and 5-HT7, alpha1-adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors (Ki values of 44 nM, 15 nM, 39 nM, 57 nM, and 61 nM, respectively), and moderate affinity for the serotonin reuptake site (Ki=98 nM). Aripiprazole has no appreciable affinity for cholinergic muscarinic receptors (IC50>1000 nM).[L45859]The antipsychotic action of aripiprazole is likely due to its partial agonist activity on D2 and 5-HT1A receptors as well as its antagonist activity at 5-HT2A receptors; however, the exact mechanism has not been fully elucidated.[A4393,L45859,L4620] One of the mechanisms that have been proposed is that aripiprazole both stimulates and inhibits dopamine as it engages the D2 receptor. It lowers dopamine neuronal firing at high dopamine concentrations and increases dopamine firing at low concentrations. Its partial agonist activity gives aripiprazole an intermediate level of dopaminergic neuronal tone between full agonist and antagonist of the D2 receptor.[A258699] In addition, some adverse effects may be due to action on other receptors.[L4620,A4393]"
836,"For treatment of psychotic disorders (e.g. schizophrenia) and of acute mania occuring as part of bipolar disorders.Chlorprothixene is a typical antipsychotic drug of the thioxanthene (tricyclic) class. Chlorprothixene exerts strong blocking effects by blocking the 5-HT2 D1, D2, D3, histamine H1, muscarinic and alpha1 adrenergic receptors.Chlorprothixene is a typical antipsychotic drug of the thioxanthine class. It has a low antipsychotic potency (half to 2/3 of chlorpromazine). Chlorprothixene has not thoroughly demonstrated an antidepressant or analgesic effect but it has demonstrated antiemetic effects. It is used in the treatment of nervous, mental, and emotional conditions. Improvement in such conditions is thought to result from the effect of the medicine on nerve pathways in specific areas of the brain. Chlorprothixene has a similar side effect profile to chlorpromazine, though allergic side effects and liver damage are less frequent.Chlorprothixene blocks postsynaptic mesolimbic dopaminergic D1 and D2 receptors in the brain; depresses the release of hypothalamic and hypophyseal hormones and is believed to depress the reticular activating system thus affecting basal metabolism, body temperature, wakefulness, vasomotor tone, and emesis."
837,"For the long-term intravenous treatment of primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with the scleroderma spectrum of disease in NYHA Class III and Class IV patients who do not respond adequately to conventional therapy.A prostaglandin that is a powerful vasodilator and inhibits platelet aggregation. It is biosynthesized enzymatically from prostaglandin endoperoxides in human vascular tissue. The sodium salt has been also used to treat primary pulmonary hypertension.Epoprostenol has two major pharmacological actions: (1) direct vasodilation of pulmonary and systemic arterial vascular beds, and (2) inhibition of platelet aggregation. In animals, the vasodilatory effects reduce right and left ventricular afterload and increase cardiac output and stroke volume. The effect of epoprostenol on heart rate in animals varies with dose. At low doses, there is vagally mediated brudycardia, but at higher doses, epoprostenol causes reflex tachycardia in response to direct vasodilation and hypotension. No major effects on cardiac conduction have been observed. Additional pharmacologic effects of epoprostenol in animals include bronchodilation, inhibition of gastric acid secretion, and decreased gastric emptying. No available chemical assay is sufficiently sensitive and specific to assess the in vivo human pharmacokinetics of epoprostenol.Prostaglandins are present in most body tissues and fluids and mediate many biological functions. Epoprostenol (PGI2) is a member of the family of prostaglandins that is derived from arachidonic acid. The major pharmacological actions of epoprostenol is ultimately inhibition of platelet aggregation. Prostacycline (PGI2) from endothelial cells activate G protein-coupled receptors on platelets and endothelial cells. This activation causes adenylate cyclase to produce cyclic AMP which inhibits further platelet activation and activates protein kinase A. Cyclic AMP also prevents coagulation by preventing an increase in intracellular calcium from thromboxane A2 binding. PKA then continues the cascade by phosphorylating and inhibiting myosin light-chain kinase which leads to smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation. Notably, PGI2 and TXA2 work as physiological antagonists."
838,"Gemfibrozil is indicated to treat patients with Types IV and V hyperlipidemia who have elevated serum triglycerides (usually above 2000mg/dL), elevated VLDL cholesterol, fasting chylomicrons, are at risk of developing pancreatitis, and do not adequately respond to dietary restrictions.[L8525] Gemfibrozil is also indicated to reduce the risk of developing coronary heart disease in patients with Type IIb hyperlipidemia without history or symptoms of coronary heart disease; who do not adequately respond to weight loss, diet, exercise, and other medications; and have low HDL, raised LDL, and raised triglycerides.[L8525]Gemfibrozil is a fibric acid agent, similar to [clofibrate], used to treat Type IIb, IV, and V hyperlipidemias.[A185777,L8525] Gemfibrozil is not a first line treatment and is prescribed to patients who have not responded adequately to weight loss, diet, exercise, and other medications.[L8525]    Gemfibrozil was granted FDA approval on 21 December 1981.[L8525]Gemfibrozil alters lipid metabolism to treat patients with hyperlipidemia.[L8525] The duration of action requires twice daily dosing as the mean residence time of gemfibrozil is up to 9.6h in patients with chronic renal failure.[A185813] Gemfibrozil has a wide therapeutic index as trials with twice the standard dose were not associated with severe side effects.[A185816,L8525] Patients taking gemfibrozil may be at an increased risk of developing cholelithiasis and cholecystitis, as seen in patients taking [clofibrate].[L8525]Gemfibrozil activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα), which alters lipid metabolism.[A185777] This activation leads to increased HDL, apo AI, apo AII, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), inhibition of apo B synthesis, peripheral lipolysis, decreased removal of free fatty acids by the liver, and increased clearance of apoB.[A185390,A185777,L8525]    Upregulated LPL reduces plasma triglyceride levels.[A185390,A185777,L8525] Decreased hepatic removal of fatty acids decreases the production of triglycerides.[A185390,A185777,L8525] The effects on apoB synthesis and clearance decrease VLDL production which also reduce plasma triglyceride levels.[A185390,A185777,L8525]    Gemfibrozil's glucuronide metabolite is also an inhibitor of CYP2C8.[A185783]"
839,"May be used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder and disorders with an obsessive-compulsive component (e.g. depression, schizophrenia, Tourette’s disorder).  Unlabeled indications include: depression, panic disorder, chronic pain (e.g. central pain, idiopathic pain disorder, tension headache, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, neuropathic pain), cataplexy and associated narcolepsy (limited evidence), autistic disorder (limited evidence), trichotillomania (limited evidence), onchophagia (limited evidence), stuttering (limited evidence), premature ejaculation, and premenstrual syndrome. Clomipramine, the 3-chloro analog of imipramine, is a dibenzazepine-derivative tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). TCAs are structurally similar to phenothiazines. They contain a tricyclic ring system with an alkyl amine substituent on the central ring. In non-depressed individuals, clomipramine does not affect mood or arousal, but may cause sedation. In depressed individuals, clomipramine exerts a positive effect on mood. TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Tertiary amine TCAs, such as clomipramine, are more potent inhibitors of serotonin reuptake than secondary amine TCAs, such as nortriptyline and desipramine. TCAs also down-regulate cerebral cortical β-adrenergic receptors and sensitize post-synaptic serotonergic receptors with chronic use. The antidepressant effects of TCAs are thought to be due to an overall increase in serotonergic neurotransmission. TCAs also block histamine-H1 receptors, α1-adrenergic receptors and muscarinic receptors, which accounts for their sedative, hypotensive and anticholinergic effects (e.g. blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention), respectively. See toxicity section below for a complete listing of side effects. Clomipramine may be used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder and disorders with an obsessive-compulsive component (e.g. depression, schizophrenia, Tourette’s disorder). Unlabeled indications include panic disorder, chronic pain (e.g. central pain, idiopathic pain disorder, tension headache, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, neuropathic pain), cataplexy and associated narcolepsy, autistic disorder, trichotillomania, onchophagia, stuttering, premature ejaculation, and premenstrual syndrome. Clomipramine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and demethylated in the liver to its primary active metabolite, desmethylclomipramine.Clomipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, is the 3-chloro derivative of Imipramine. It was thought that tricyclic antidepressants work exclusively by inhibiting the re-uptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin by nerve cells. However, this response occurs immediately, yet mood does not lift for around two weeks. It is now thought that changes occur in receptor sensitivity in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The hippocampus is part of the limbic system, a part of the brain involved in emotions. Presynaptic receptors are affected: α1 and β1 receptors are sensitized, α2 receptors are desensitized (leading to increased noradrenaline production). Tricyclics are also known as effective analgesics for different types of pain, especially neuropathic or neuralgic pain.Clomipramine is a strong, but not completely selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI), as the active main metabolite desmethyclomipramine acts preferably as an inhibitor of noradrenaline reuptake. α1-receptor blockage and β-down-regulation have been noted and most likely play a role in the short term effects of clomipramine. A blockade of sodium-channels and NDMA-receptors might, as with other tricyclics, account for its effect in chronic pain, in particular the neuropathic type. "
840,"For the treatment of hypertension, and chronic stable angina (classic effort-associated angina).A long-acting, non selective, calcium channel blocker with significant anti-anginal activity. The drug produces significant coronary vasodilation and modest peripheral effects. It has antihypertensive and selective anti-arrhythmia activities and acts as a calmodulin antagonist. It is no longer marketed in the United States, as it has been implicated in causing ventricular arrhythmias (ie. Torsade de pointes).Bepridil is a calcium channel blocker that has well characterized anti-anginal properties and known but poorly characterized type 1 anti-arrhythmic and anti-hypertensive properties. It is not related chemically to other calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem hydrochloride, nifedipine and verapamil hydrochloride.Bepridil has inhibitory effects on both the slow calcium (L-type) and fast sodium inward currents in myocardial and vascular smooth muscle, interferes with calcium binding to calmodulin, and blocks both voltage and receptor operated calcium channels. Bepridil inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac and vascular smooth muscle. This has been demonstrated in isolated myocardial and vascular smooth muscle preparations in which both the slope of the calcium dose response curve and the maximum calcium-induced inotropic response were significantly reduced by bepridil. In cardiac myocytes in vitro, bepridil was shown to be tightly bound to actin. Bepridil regularly reduces heart rate and arterial pressure at rest and at a given level of exercise by dilating peripheral arterioles and reducing total peripheral resistance (afterload) against which the heart works."
841,"Used to prevent and relieve allergic conditions which cause pruritus (itching) and urticaria (some allergic skin reactions).A phenothiazine derivative that is used as an antipruritic.Trimeprazine (also known as Alimemazine) is a tricyclic antihistamine, similar in structure to the phenothiazine antipsychotics, but differing in the ring-substitution and chain characteristics. Trimeprazine is in the same class of drugs as chlorpromazine (Thorazine) and trifluoperazine (Stelazine); however, unlike the other drugs in this class, trimeprazine is not used clinically as an anti-psychotic. It acts as an anti-histamine, a sedative, and an anti-emetic (anti-nausea). Trimeprazine is used principally as an anti-emetic, to prevent motion sickness or as an anti-histamine in combination with other medications in cough and cold preparations. Tricyclic antihistamines are also structurally-related to the tricyclic antidepressants, explaining the antihistaminergic adverse effects of these two drug classes and also the poor tolerability profile of tricyclic H<sub>1</sub>-antihistamines.Trimeprazine competes with free histamine for binding at HA-receptor sites. This antagonizes the effects of histamine on HA-receptors, leading to a reduction of the negative symptoms brought on by histamine HA-receptor binding."
842,"Isocarboxazid is indicated for the treatment of the enduring and debilitating symptoms of depression that have not responded to other antidepressant drugs.[L1372] Depression is a common but serious mood disorder. The patient will present changes in its feelings, thoughts, and ability to handle everyday activities. For a mood disorder to be considered as depression, the symptoms should be present for at least two weeks.[L1375]Isocarboxazid has the formula 1-benzyl-2-(5-methyl-3-isoxazolylcarbonyl)hydrazine-isocarboxazid. It is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor.[A31930] It is used in the treatment of major depression, dysthymic disorder, atypical disorder, panic disorder and the phobic disorders.[T115] It was first introduced by Roche pharmaceuticals, further developed by Validus pharms Inc and first FDA approved as a prescription drug on July 1st, 1959.In vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated isocarboxazid-driven inhibition of MAO in the brain, heart, and liver. The reduced MAO activity, caused by isocarboxazid, results in an increased concentration of serotonin, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine in storage sites throughout the central nervous system (CNS) and sympathetic nervous system. The increase of one or more monoamines is the basis for the antidepressant activity of MAO inhibitors like isocarboxazid.[A2219]Isocarboxazid works by irreversibly blocking the action of monoamine oxidases (MAO) in the nervous system. MAO subtypes A and B are involved in the metabolism of serotonin and catecholamine neurotransmitters such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Isocarboxazid, as a nonselective MAO inhibitor, binds irreversibly to monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) and monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B).[A2219] Isocarboxacid, like other monoamine oxidase inhibitors, are unique psychopharmacological agents whose clinical effect is related to the direct action of the monoamine oxidases to transform them into reactive metabolites.[T114]"
843,"Docetaxel is indicated as a single agent for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after chemotherapy failure; and with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide as adjuvant treatment of operable node-positive BC. It is also indicated as a single agent for locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after platinum therapy failure; and with cisplatin for unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic untreated NSCLC. For the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, docetaxel is indicated with prednisone. Docetaxel is also indicated with cisplatin and fluorouracil for untreated, advanced gastric adenocarcinoma, including the gastroesophageal junction, and with cisplatin and fluorouracil for induction treatment of locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN).[L46466]Docetaxel is a clinically well established anti-mitotic chemotherapy medication used for the treatment of different types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, and non-small cell lung cancer. Docetaxel is a complex diterpenoid molecule and a semisynthetic analogue of [paclitaxel].[A259676,L46466] Docetaxel reversibly binds to microtubulin with high affinity in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio, allowing it to prevent cell division and promote to cell death.[A259676] Compared to paclitaxel, docetaxel is two times more potent as an inhibitor of microtubule depolymerization. Docetaxel binds to microtubules but does not interact with dimeric tubulin.[A259671]    The use of docetaxel may lead to udesired outcomes such as hepatic impairment, hematologic effects, enterocolitis and neutropenic colitis, hypersensitivity reactions, fluid retention, second primary malignancies, embryo-fetal toxicity, and tumor lysis syndrome.[L46466] Docetaxel was approved by the FDA in 1996 and is available in solution for injection for intravenous or parenteral administration.[A259676]Docetaxel is a taxoid antineoplastic agent. It promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilizes microtubules by preventing depolymerization. This stability results in the inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubule network which is essential for vital interphase and mitotic cellular functions. In addition, docetaxel induces abnormal arrays or ""bundles"" of microtubules throughout the cell cycle and multiple asters of microtubules during mitosis.[A259666,A259671]    The use of docetaxel may lead to treatment-related deaths in breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer patients, hepatic impairment, hematologic effects, enterocolitis and neutropenic colitis, hypersensitivity reactions, fluid retention, second primary malignancies, cutaneous reactions, neurologic reactions, eye disorders, asthenia, embryo-fetal toxicity, and tumor lysis syndrome.[L46466]Docetaxel interferes with the normal function of microtubule growth. Whereas drugs like [colchicine] cause the depolymerization of microtubules in vivo, docetaxel arrests their function by having the opposite effect; it hyper-stabilizes their structure. This destroys the cell's ability to use its cytoskeleton in a flexible manner. Specifically, docetaxel binds to the &beta;-subunit of tubulin. Tubulin is the ""building block"" of microtubules, and the binding of docetaxel locks these building blocks in place. The resulting microtubule/docetaxel complex does not have the ability to disassemble. This adversely affects cell function because the shortening and lengthening of microtubules (termed dynamic instability) is necessary for their function as a transportation highway for the cell. Chromosomes, for example, rely upon this property of microtubules during mitosis. Further research has indicated that docetaxel induces programmed cell death (apoptosis) in cancer cells by binding to an apoptosis-stopping protein called Bcl-2 (B-cell leukemia 2), thus arresting its function.[A259666,A259671,L46466]"

It is an imaging contrast agent with the same osmolality as blood (290mOsm/kg H20).Organic iodine compounds attenuate x-rays as they pass through the body, thereby allowing the body structures containing iodine to be delineated in contrast to those structures that do not contain iodine. The degree of opacity produced by these compounds is directly proportional to the total amount (concentration and volume) of the iodinated contrast agent in the path of the x-rays. After intravascular administration, iodixanol makes opaque those internal structures in its path of flow, allowing their visualization until significant hemodilution and elimination occur."
845,"In the US, olsalazine is indicated for the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis in adult patients who are intolerant to [sulfasalazine].[L45023]    In Canada, it is used in the treatment of acute ulcerative colitis of mild to moderate severity, with or without the concomitant use of steroids. It is also indicated for the long-term maintenance of patients with ulcerative colitis in remission.[L45151]Olsalazine is an aminosalicylate and a prodrug of [mesalamine] (5-aminosalicylic acid, 5-ASA).[A257063] It was first developed for delivering mesalamine to the colon without the use of [sulfapyridine].[A257078] Olsalazine comprises two mesalamine molecules joined by an azo bridge, which is cleaved in the colon.[A257078] Olsalazine is an anti-inflammatory agent that works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase, subsequently reducing the production of pro-inflammatory factors like prostaglandin and leukotriene.[A257063] Olsalazine is used in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.[L45023,L45151]Olsalazine is an anti-inflammatory agent that blocks the production of cyclooxygenase (COX)-derived products of arachidonic acid metabolism.[L45023] It works to alleviate inflammation in ulcerative colitis.[A257063]     Olsalazine was shown to decrease water and sodium absorption. While olsalazine is not expected to affect the motility and transit time of small intestines, it decreased small bowel transit time at high doses ranging from 60 to 120 mg/kg. In about 40% of the patients with ulcerative colitis, administration of olsalazine 1g daily was associated with a decrease in whole gut transit time.[A257063] Upon administration, the azo bond connecting two molecules of mesalamine (also known as 5-aminosalicylic acid or 5-ASA) is cleaved by azoreductase-containing bacteria in the colon. The two molecules of mesalamine are released to mediate therapeutic effects.[A257063] The exact mechanism of action of olsalazine and its active moiety mesalamine in ulcerative colitis has not been elucidated; however, it is understood that mesalamine mediates an anti-inflammatory action on epithelial cells of the colon.[L45023] The COX-derived (i.e., prostanoids such as prostaglandin E2) and lipoxygenase-derived products (i.e., leukotrienes [LTs] and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids [HETEs]) of arachidonic acid metabolism have been implicated in the pathogenesis and maintenance of inflammatory disorders, including ulcerative colitis and inflammatory bowel disease.[A257063,L45023] Mesalamine may attenuate inflammation by blocking the COX enzyme and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon.[A257221,A4391,L45023] Olsalazine was also shown to inhibit xanthine oxidase, an enzyme that generates oxygen-derived free radicals.[A257078]    Olsalazine may attenuate intestinal inflammation by limiting macrophage migration to inflamed intestinal mucosa: it was shown to inhibit _in vitro_ migration of intestinal macrophages in response to leukotriene B4. Olsalazine may also act as a free radical scavenger, and mesalazine may suppress fatty acid peroxidation.[A257063]"
846,"Used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2.Gliquidone is a sulfonylurea drug used to treat diabetes mellitus type 2. It is an ATP-dependent K+ (KATP) channel blocker. This block causes a depolarization which leads to activation of voltage-dependent Ca channels and Ca2+ influx, and eventually increases insulin release.Gliquidone is an anti-diabetic drug in the sulfonylurea class. In patients with diabetes mellitus, there is a deficiency or absence of a hormone manufactured by the pancreas called insulin. Insulin is the main hormone responsible for the control of sugar in the blood. Gliquidone is an antidiabetic medication which is used in those patients with adult maturity onset or non-insulin dependent diabetes (NIDDM). It works by lowering blood sugar levels by stimulating the production and release of insulin from the pancreas. It also promotes the movement of sugar from the blood into the cells in the body which need it.  The mechanism of action of gliquidone in lowering blood glucose appears to be dependent on stimulating the release of insulin from functioning pancreatic beta cells, and increasing sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin. Gliquidone likely binds to ATP-sensitive potassium channel receptors on the pancreatic cell surface, reducing potassium conductance and causing depolarization of the membrane. Membrane depolarization stimulates calcium ion influx through voltage-sensitive calcium channels. This increase in intracellular calcium ion concentration induces the secretion of insulin."
847,"For the treatment of type 2 diabetes.Mitiglinide is a drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. It may stimulate insulin secretion in beta-cells by closing off ATP dependant potassium ion channels.Mitiglinide belongs to the meglitinide class of blood glucose-lowering drugs. It is approved for use in Japan but has not yet gained FDA approval.Mitiglinide is thought to stimulate insulin secretion by binding to and blocking ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channels (Kir6.2/SUR1 complex, KATP channels) in pancreatic beta-cells. Closure of potassium channels causes depolarization which stimulates calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels. High intracellular calcium subsequently triggers the exocytosis of insulin granules. "
848,"Used to treat postpartum haemorrhage and postabortion haemorrhage in patients with uterine atony. An ergot alkaloid with uterine and vascular smooth muscle contractile properties.Ergonovine belongs to the group of medicines known as ergot alkaloids. These medicines are usually given to stop excessive bleeding that sometimes occurs after abortion or a baby is delivered. They work by causing the muscle of the uterus to contract.Ergonovine directly stimulates the uterine muscle to increase force and frequency of contractions. With usual doses, these contractions precede periods of relaxation; with larger doses, basal uterine tone is elevated and these relaxation periods will be decreased. Contraction of the uterine wall around bleeding vessels at the placental site produces hemostasis. Ergonovine also induces cervical contractions. The sensitivity of the uterus to the oxytocic effect is much greater toward the end of pregnancy. The oxytocic actions of ergonovine are greater than its vascular effects. Ergonovine, like other ergot alkaloids, produces arterial vasoconstriction by stimulation of alpha-adrenergic and serotonin receptors and inhibition of endothelial-derived relaxation factor release. It is a less potent vasoconstrictor than ergotamine. As a diagnostic aid (coronary vasospasm), ergonovine causes vasoconstriction of coronary arteries."

Dasatinib is also indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients 1 year of age and older with Ph+ CML in chronic phase or newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL in combination with chemotherapy.[L45171]Dasatinib is an orally available multikinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive leukemias.[A2224,L45171] Ph is a chromosomal abnormality found in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), where the ABL tyrosine kinase and the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) gene transcribe the chimeric protein BCR-ABL. BCR-ABL is associated with the uncontrolled activity of the ABL tyrosine kinase and is involved in the pathogenesis of CML and 15-30% of ALL cases.[A11377,A33432] Dasatinib also inhibits a spectrum of kinases involved in cancer, including several SRC-family kinases.[A2226,A11377] Also, mutations in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL may lead to relapse during imatinib treatment. Since dasatinib does not interact with some of the residues involved in those mutations, the use of this drug represents a therapeutic alternative for patients with cancers that have developed imatinib-resistance.[A2226] The use of dasatinib was first approved by the FDA in 2006.[L45171,L45186]Dasatinib is an orally available small-molecule multikinase inhibitor.[A11377] During clinical trials, less than 1% of patients treated with dasatinib had QTc prolongation as an adverse reaction, and 1% experienced a QTcF higher than 500 ms. The use of dasatinib is also associated with myelosuppression, bleeding-related events, fluid retention, cardiovascular toxicity, pulmonary arterial hypertension, severe dermatologic reactions, tumor lysis syndrome and hepatotoxicity. It may also cause embryo-fetal toxicity and lead to adverse reactions associated with bone growth and development in pediatric patients.[L45171]Dasatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with several targets. At nanomolar concentrations, it inhibits BCR-ABL, SRC family (SRC, LCK, YES, FYN), c-KIT, EPHA2, and PDGFR&beta;.[A2224,A11377,L45171] In patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), the tyrosine kinase activity of BCR-ABL is deregulated, leading to the growth, proliferation and survival of cancerous hematopoietic cells. Dasatinib binds to the active and inactive conformation of the ABL kinase domain with a higher affinity than imatinib.[A33432] In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines overexpressing BCR-ABL, dasatinib inhibits cell growth. Also, dasatinib has _in vitro_ activity against leukemic cell lines that are either sensitive or resistant to imatinib.[L45171] It has been suggested that dasatinib is able to overcome imatinib resistance caused by BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations because it does not require interaction with some of the residues involved in those mutations.[A33432,L45171]"

It was approved by the FDA on March 13, 2007, for use in patients with advanced metastatic breast cancer in conjunction with the chemotherapy drug capecitabine. Lapatinib is a human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2/ERBB2) and epidermal growth factor receptor (HER1/EGFR/ERBB1) tyrosine kinases inhibitor. It binds to the intracellular phosphorylation domain to prevent receptor autophosphorylation upon ligand binding.Lapatinib is a small molecule and a member of the 4-anilinoquinazoline class of kinase inhibitors.

Lapatinib inhibits ERBB-driven tumor cell growth in vitro and in various animal models. The growth inhibitory effects of lapatinib were evaluated in trastuzumab-conditioned cell lines. Lapatinib retained significant activity against breast cancer cell lines selected for long-term growth in trastuzumab-containing medium in vitro. These in vitro findings suggest non-cross-resistance between these two agents."
851,"For the relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid responsive dermatose.A nonfluorinated corticosteroid anti-inflammatory agent used topically for dermatoses.Desonide is a synthetic nonfluorinated corticosteroid for topical dermatologic use. The corticosteroids constitute a class of primarily synthetic steroids used topically as anti-inflammatory and antipruritic agents.Like other topical corticosteroids, desonide has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive properties. The drug binds to cytosolic glucocorticoid receptors. This complex migrates to the nucleus and binds to genetic elements on the DNA. This activates and represses various genes. However corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2."
852,"Sitagliptin is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is not used to treat type 1 diabetes or patients with a history of pancreatitis.[L41225]Sitagliptin is an oral dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor used in conjunction with diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus[FDA label,A2260,A2255,A2256]. The effect of this medication leads to glucose dependent increases in insulin and decreases in glucagon to improve control of blood sugar[FDA label,A2255]. Sitagliptin was granted FDA approval on October 16, 2006[L6061].Sitagliptin inhibits DPP-4 which leads to increased levels of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide(GIP), decreased levels of glucagon, and a stronger insulin response to glucose[FDA label,A2260,A2255,A2256].Inhibition of DPP-4 by sitagliptin slows DPP-4 mediated inactivation of incretins like GLP-1 and GIP[FDA label,A2256]. Incretins are released throughout the day and upregulated in response to meals as part of glucose homeostasis[FDA label,A2260]. Reduced inhibition of incretins increase insulin synthesis and decrease glucagon release in a manner dependant on glucose concentrations[FDA label,A2255]. These effects lead to an overall increase in blood glucose control which is demonstrated by reduced glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c)[FDA label,A2260]."
853,"Decitabine is indicated for the treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) including all French-American-British subtypes (refractory anemia, refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts, refractory anemia with excess blasts, refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation, and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia), as well as for MDS scored as belonging to the intermediate-1, intermediate-2, or high-risk group in the International Prognostic Scoring System.[L14962]Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of hematopoietic neoplasms with variable underlying etiology and presentation, including neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Further mutations leading to increased proliferation of cancerous cells can eventually lead to secondary acute myeloid leukemia, which has a poor prognosis.[A215082, A215092] Among treatment options, nucleoside analogues such as decitabine and [azacitidine] integrate into cellular DNA and inhibit the action of DNA methyltransferases, leading to global hypomethylation and related downstream therapeutic benefits.[A2263, A2264, A2265, A215317, L14962]    Decitabine was developed by MGI Pharma/SuperGen Inc. and was approved by the FDA for the treatment of MDS on February 5, 2006. It was first marketed under the name Dacogen®.[L14962] It is also available as an oral combination product together with the cytidine deaminase inhibitor [cedazuridine].Decitabine is a prodrug analogue of the natural nucleotide 2’-deoxycytidine, which, upon being phosphorylated intracellularly, is incorporated into DNA and exerts numerous effects on gene expression.[A2263, A2264, A2265, A215317, L14962] The use of decitabine is associated with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. In addition, decitabine can cause fetal harm in pregnant women; effective contraception and avoidance of pregnancy are recommended during treatment with decitabine.[L14962]Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of hematopoietic neoplasms that manifest in peripheral cytopenias and may eventually progress to secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML). Included in the over 45 genes commonly mutated in MDS patients are those involved in DNA methylation and histone modification, and it is well-established that alteration of the epigenetic landscape is a feature of myeloid leukemias.[A215082, A215092]    Decitabine is considered a prodrug, as it requires transport into cells and subsequent phosphorylation by distinct kinases to generate the active molecule 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine-triphosphate, which is incorporated by DNA polymerase during DNA replication.[A2263, A2265, A2266, A2267, A215317, L14962] Once incorporated into DNA, decitabine is recognized as a substrate by DNA methyltransferase enzymes (DNMTs), specifically DNMT1, but due to the presence of an N5 rather than C5 atom, traps the DNMT through the irreversible formation of a covalent bond.[A2266, A2267] At low concentrations, this mode of action depletes DNMTs and results in global DNA hypomethylation while at high concentrations, it additionally results in double-strand breaks and cell death.[A2264, A2267, A215317]    The general hypothesis regarding decitabine's therapeutic efficacy is that the global hypomethylation it induces results in the expression of previously silent tumour suppressor genes.[A2261, A2262, A2263, A2264, A2265, A2266, A2267, A215317, L14962] However, there are other putative mechanisms also related to this change in DNA methylation, including indirect alteration of transcription through effects on transcription factors, indirectly altering histone modifications and chromatin structure, and activating pathways involved in DNA damage response.[A2263, A2265, A2267, A215317] The overall effect of decitabine is a decrease in neoplastic cell proliferation and an increase in the expression of tumour suppressor genes."

Posaconazole is used as an alternative treatment for invasive aspergillosis, Fusarium infections, and zygomycosis in patients who are intolerant of, or whose disease is refractory to, other antifungals.Posaconazole is a triazole antifungal drug that is used to treat invasive infections by Candida species and Aspergillus species in severely immunocompromised patients.Posaconazole is an antifungal agent structurally related to itraconazole. It is a drug derived from itraconzaole through the replacement of the chlorine substituents with flourine in the phenyl ring, as well as hydroxylation of the triazolone side chain. These modifications enhance the potency and spectrum of activity of the drug. Posaconazole can be either fungicial or fungistatic in action.As a triazole antifungal agent, posaconazole exerts its antifungal activity through blockage of the cytochrome P-450 dependent enzyme, sterol 14&alpha;-demethylase, in fungi by binding to the heme cofactor located on the enzyme. This leads to the inhibition of the synthesis of ergosterol, a key component of the fungal cell membrane, and accumulation of methylated sterol precursors. This results in inhibition of fungal cell growth and ultimately, cell death."
855,"[L9227] Darunavir is a protease inhibitor used with other HIV protease inhibitor drugs as well as [ritonavir] for the effective management of HIV-1 infection.[L9227] As a second-generation protease inhibitor, darunavir is designed to combat resistance to standard HIV therapy.[A2278,A2281] It was initially approved by the FDA in 2006.[L9227]    Darunavir is being studied as a possible treatment for SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus responsible for COVID-19, due to in vitro evidence supporting its ability to combat this infection.[A191682] Clinical trials are underway and are expected to conclude in August 2020.[L12066]Darunavir is an inhibitor of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease, which prevents HIV viral replication.[L9227] When administered with ritonavir in combination antiretroviral therapy, darunavir significantly decreases viral load and increases CD4 cell counts, decreasing the morbidity and mortality of HIV infection.[A2278,A2281,A191520]The HIV-1 protease enzyme is necessary for viral precursor protein processing and viral maturation in preparation for infection, and is therefore a target for antiretroviral therapy for HIV.  Protease inhibitors are used as a part of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in patients diagnosed with HIV infection. It has been shown to effectively suppress the virus, leading to significantly decreased morbidity and mortality rates.[A2281]    Darunavir, a HIV protease inhibitor, prevents HIV replication through binding to the enzyme, stopping the dimerization and the catalytic activity of HIV-1 protease. In particular, it inhibits the cleavage of HIV encoded Gag-Pol proteins[A191556] in cells that have been infected with the virus, halting the formation of mature virus particles, which spread the infection. The close contact that darunavir makes with the primary chains of the active site amino acids (Asp-29 and Asp-30) on the protease likely contributes to its potency and efficacy against resistant variants of HIV-1.[A2281]     Darunavir is known to bind to different sites on the enzyme: the active site cavity and the surface of one of the flexible flaps in the protease dimer. Darunavir can adapt to changes in the shape of a protease enzyme due to its molecular flexibility.[A2281,A191526]"

The use of arformoterol is pending revision due to safety concerns in regards to an increased risk of severe exacerbation of asthma symptoms, leading to hospitalization as well as death in some patients using long-acting beta agonists for the treatment of asthma.Arformoterol, the active (R,R)-enantiomer of formoterol, is a selective long-acting β2-adrenergic receptor agonist (beta2-agonist) that has two-fold greater potency than racemic formoterol (which contains both the (S,S) and (R,R)-enantiomers). The (S,S)-enantiomer is about 1,000-fold less potent as a β2-agonist than the (R,R)-enantiomer. Arformoterol seems to have little or no effect on β1-adrenergic receptors.While it is recognized that β2-receptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle and β1-receptors are the predominant receptors in the heart, data indicate that there are also β2-receptors in the human heart comprising 10% to 50% of the total beta-adrenergic receptors. The precise function of these receptors has not been established, but they raise the possibility that even highly selective β2-agonists may have cardiac effects. The pharmacologic effects of β2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including arformoterol, are at least in part attributable to the stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3,5-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased intracellular cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of the release of proinflammatory mediators from cells, especially from mast cells. In vitro tests show that arformoterol is an inhibitor of the release of mast cell mediators, such as histamine and leukotrienes, from the human lung. Arformoterol also inhibits histamine-induced plasma albumin extravasation in anesthetized guinea pigs and inhibits allergen-induced eosinophil influx in dogs with airway hyper-response."
859,"Hydralazine is indicated alone or adjunct to standard therapy to treat essential hypertension.[L8782] A combination product with isosorbide dinitrate is indicated as an adjunct therapy in the treatment of heart failure.[L8785]Originally developed in the 1950s as a malaria treatment, hydralazine showed antihypertensive ability and was soon repurposed.[A186841] Hydralazine is a hydrazine derivative vasodilator used alone or as adjunct therapy in the treatment of hypertension and only as adjunct therapy in the treatment of heart failure.[A186820,L8782,L8785] Hydralazine is no longer a first line therapy for these indications since the development of newer antihypertensive medications.[T691]    Hydralazine hydrochloride was FDA approved on 15 January 1953.[L8779]Hydralazine interferes with calcium transport to relax arteriolar smooth muscle and lower blood pressure.[L8782] Hydralazine has a short duration of action of 2-6h.[A186820] This drug has a wide therapeutic window, as patients can tolerate doses of up to 300mg.[L8782] Patients should be cautioned regarding the risk of developing systemic lupus erythematosus syndrome.[L8782]Hydralazine may interfere with calcium transport in vascular smooth muscle by an unknown mechanism to relax arteriolar smooth muscle and lower blood pressure.[A186820,A13596] The interference with calcium transport may be by preventing influx of calcium into cells, preventing calcium release from intracellular compartments, directly acting on actin and myosin, or a combination of these actions.[A186829] This decrease in vascular resistance leads to increased heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output.[L8782]    Hydralazine also competes with protocollagen prolyl hydroxylase (CPH) for free iron.[A13596] This competition inhibits CPH mediated hydroxylation of HIF-1α, preventing the degradation of HIF-1α.[A13596] Induction of HIF-1α and VEGF promote proliferation of endothelial cells and angiogenesis.[A13596]"
860,"Exenatide is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. An extended-release formulation is available which is indicated in patients ≥10 years old,[L45118] while the immediate-acting formulation is approved only for adult patients.[L42690]Exenatide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analog[L42690]. It activates the GLP-1 receptor and increases insulin secretion, decreases glucagon secretion, and slows gastric emptying to improve glycemic control[L42690]. Exenatide was given FDA approval on April 28, 2005[L6106]. It is available as immediate- and extended-release formulations.[L42685,L42690] Bydureon, the brand name product of extended-release exenatide in an injectable suspension, was discontinued in 2021. Bydureon BCise, an auto-injector extended-release formulation, remains available.[L42700]When patients take exenatide the body's natural response to glucose is modulated[Label]. More insulin and less glucagon are released in response to glucose, though in cases of hypoglycemia a normal amount of glucagon is released[Label]. Exenatide also slows gastric emptying, leading to a slower and prolonged release of glucose into the systemic circulation[Label]. Together these effects prevent hyper and hypoglycemia[Label].Exenatide is a human glucacon-like peptide-1(GLP-1) receptor agonist[Label]. By activating this receptor, insulin secretion is increased and glucagon secretion is decreased in a glucose dependant manner[Label]. Exenatide also slows gastric emptying and decreases food intake[Label]. These effects work synergistically to improve glycemic control by reducing the likelihood of hyper and hypoglycemia[Label]."
861,"For the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to preprandial insulin therapy in patients without adequate glycemic control of insulin therapy.Pramlintide is a relatively new adjunct treatment for diabetes (both type 1 and 2), developed by Amylin Pharmaceuticals. It is derived from amylin, a hormone that is released into the bloodstream, in a similar pattern as insulin, after a meal. Like insulin, amylin is deficient in individuals with diabetes.Pramlintide is a synthetic analog of amylin, a glucoregulatory hormone that is synthesized by pancreatic β-cells and released into the bloodstream, in a similar pattern as insulin, after a meal. Like insulin, amylin is deficient in individuals with diabetes. It is provided as an acetate salt. Pramlintide is a 37-amino acid polypeptide that differs structurally from human amylin by the replacement of alanine, serine, and serine at positions 25, 28, and 29 respectively with proline.Pramlintide is an amlyinomimetic, a functional analog of the naturally occurring pancreatic hormone amylin. Amylin has activity in a number of gastrointestinal and glucodynamic systems, and by mimicking its activity, pramlintide acts to improve glycemic control through modulation of the rate of gastric emptying, prevention of post-prandial rise in glucagon levels, and by increasing sensations of satiety, thereby reducing caloric intake and potentiating weight loss. There appears to be at least three distinct receptor complexes that bind with high affinity to amylin. All three complexes contain the calcitonin receptor at the core, plus one of three Receptor activity-modifying proteins, RAMP1, RAMP2, or RAMP3."
862,"ARRANON is indicated for the treatment of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) in adult and pediatric patients age 1 year and older whose disease has not responded to or has relapsed following treatment with at least two chemotherapy regimens.[L40878] Nelarabine is an antineoplastic agent that is typically used to treat acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia, particularly T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL), in both adult and pediatric patients whose disease has not responded to or has relapsed following at least two chemotherapy regimens.[L40878] T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoma are relatively rare T-cells malignancy, with only 20 to 25% of patients diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 1.7% of patients diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma having this T-cells variation of the disease.[A2332] Due to the rarity of these T-cell malignancies, nelarabine was first granted orphan drug status and a fast-track designation by the FDA to address the unmet therapeutic needs of these cancers.[A2331]    Nelarabine is a purine nucleoside analog converted to its corresponding arabinosylguanine nucleotide triphosphate (araGTP), resulting in the inhibition of DNA synthesis and cytotoxicity.[L40878] Nelarabine preferentially accumulates in T-cells since T-cells have a higher expression of enzymes that convert nelarabine to the active purine analog form, making them effective against T-cells malignancies.[A2331,AA2334,2335] Results from 2 phase 2 studies on adult and pediatric T-ALL/T-LBL indicated that nelarabine can yield a 13% complete response (CR) rate in pediatric patients and 18% in adult patients, albeit with serious hematological and neurological adverse events.[A258719]    Nelarabine was first granted accelerated approval by the FDA on October 28, 2005, and was manufactured under the trademark name ARRANON by GlaxoSmithKline.[A15220] Subsequently, nelarabine was also approved by both Health Canada and European Medicines Agency in 2007 under the trademark name ATRIANCE.[L45874,L45879]Nelarabine is a prodrug of the cytotoxic deoxyguanosine analogue 9-&szlig;-D-arabinofuranosylguanine (ara-G). Nelarabine is demethylated by adenosine deaminase (ADA) to ara-G.[L40878] Ara-G is then transported into cells, where it undergoes three phosphorylation steps, resulting in the formation of ara-G triphosphate (ara-GTP). In the first phosphorylation step, ara-G is converted to ara-G monophosphate (ara-GMP).[L40878] Ara-GMP is then monophosphorylated by deoxyguanosine kinase and deoxycytidine kinase to ara-G diphosphate, and then subsequently to the active ara-G triphosphate (ara-GTP). Ara-GTP is the one that exerts the pharmacological effect. Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that targeted T-cells possess marked sensitivity to the agent.[L40878] Since T lymphoblasts have a higher expression of deoxycytidine kinase, ara-G preferentially accumulates in T cells over B cells, thus showing higher toxicity to T lymphoblasts.[A2331,AA2334,2335]Once nelarabine is metabolized into ara-GTP, the metabolite accumulates in leukemic blasts and incorporates into DNA to exert its S phase-specific cytotoxic effects, leading to the induction of fragmentation and apoptosis. As a nucleoside analog, Ara-GTP competes with endogenous deoxyGTP (dGTP) for incorporation into DNA.[A2333,A2334,A2335,A2336] Due to its intact 3'-OH group, ara-GTP can be incorporated into the growing DNA strand without absolute chain termination.[A2337] Despite that, the inclusion of ara-GTP into DNA strand can impair proper DNA repair processes, although the exact mechanism is not well understood, leading to inhibition of DNA elongation, apoptosis, and cellular destruction. Additional cytotoxic activities may exist, but these are not fully understood.[A2332,A2333,A2334,A2337]"
863,"Abatacept is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis and in patients ≥2 years of age for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis.[L48811] In patients two years of age and older, abatacept is also indicated for the treatment of moderately-to-severely active juvenile idiopathic arthritis.[L20504]Abatacept is a soluble fusion protein, which links the extracellular domain of human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) to the modified Fc (hinge, CH2, and CH3 domains) portion of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1).[L20504,L42715] Structurally, abatacept is a glycosylated fusion protein with a MALDI-MS molecular weight of 92,300 Da and it is a homodimer of two homologous polypeptide chains of 357 amino acids each. It is produced through recombinant DNA technology in mammalian CHO cells. The drug has activity as a selective co-stimulation modulator with inhibitory activity on T lymphocytes. Although approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, Repligen has entered a slightly different formulation of CTLA4-Ig into clinical trials (RG2077).Abatacept is the first in a new class of drugs known as Selective Co-stimulation Modulators. Known as a recombinant fusion protein, the drug consists of the extracellular domain of human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) linked to a modified Fc portion of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1. The Fc portion of the drug consists of the hinge region, the CH2 domain, and the CH3 domain of IgG1. Although there are multiple pathways and cell types involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, evidence suggests that T-cell activation may play an important role in the immunopathology of the disease. Ordinarily, full T-cell activation requires binding of the T-cell receptor to an antigen-MHC complex on the antigen-presenting cell as well as a co-stimulatory signal provided by the binding of the CD28 protein on the surface of the T-cell with the CD80/86 proteins on the surface of the antigen-presenting cell. CTLA4 is a naturally occurring protein which is expressed on the surface of T-cells some hours or days after full T-cell activation and is capable of binding to CD80/86 on antigen-presenting cells with much greater affinity than CD28. Binding of CTLA4-Ig to CD80/86 provides a negative feedback mechanism which results in T-cell deactivation. Abatacept was developed by Bristol-Myers-Squibb and is licensed in the US for the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis in the case of inadequate response to anti-TNF-alpha therapy.Abatacept is a selective costimulation modulator - like CTLA-4, the drug has shown to inhibit T-cell (T lymphocyte) activation by binding to CD80 and CD86, thereby blocking interaction with CD28. Blockade of this interaction has been shown to inhibit the delivery of the second co-stimulatory signal required for optimal activation of T-cells. This results in the inhibition of autoimmune T-Cell activation that has been implcated in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. "
864,"For the acute and chronic treatment of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee in adults.Lumiracoxib is a COX-2 selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). On August 11, 2007, Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA, the Australian equivalent of the FDA) cancelled the registration of lumiracoxib in Australia due to concerns that it may cause liver failure. New Zealand and Canada have also followed suit in recalling the drug.Lumiracoxib has a different structure from the standard COX-2 inhibitors (e.g. celecoxib). It more closely resembles the structure of diclofenac (one chlorine substituted by fluorine, the phenylacetic acid has another methyl group in meta position), making it a member of the arylalkanoic acid family of NSAIDs. It binds to a different site on the COX-2 receptor than the standard COX-2 inhibitors. It displays extremely high COX-2 selectivity.The mechanism of action of lumiracoxib is due to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis via inhibition of cyclooygenase-2 (COX-2). Lumiracoxib does not inhibit COX-1 at therapeutic concentrations."
865,"For use as a diagnostic agent in the screening of patients presumed to have adrenocortical insufficiency.Tetracosactide (also known as Cosyntropin) is a synthetic peptide that is identical to the 24-amino acid segment (sequence: SYSMEHFRWGKPVGKKRRPVKVYP) at the N-terminal of adrenocorticotropic hormone. ACTH (1-24), a segment similar in all species, contains the biological activity that stimulates production of corticosteroids in the adrenal cortex. Tetracosactide exhibits the same activity as natural ACTH with regard to all its biological activities. The complex results in a product whose absorption in man is effected over a longer period of time as compared to corticotropin. Therefore, therapy may be maintained with less frequent administration.Cosyntropin exhibits the full corticosteroidogenic activity of natural ACTH. Various studies have shown that the biologic activity of ACTH resides in the N- terminal portion of the molecule and that the 1-20 amino acid residue is the minimal sequence retaining full activity. Partial or complete loss of activity is noted with progressive shortening of the chain beyond 20 amino acid residue. For example, the decrement from 20 to 19 results in a 70% loss of potency. The pharmacologic profile of Cosyntropin is similar to that of purified natural ACTH. It has been established that 0.25 mg of Cosyntropin will stimulate the adrenal cortex maximally and to the same extent as 25 units of natural ACTH. Cosyntropin has less immunogenic activity than ACTH because the amino acid sequence having most of the antigenic activity of ACTH, i.e., amino acids 25-39, is not present in cosyntropin. The extra-adrenal effects which natural ACTH and Cosyntropin have in common include increased melanotropic activity, increased growth hormone secretion and an adipokinetic effect. These are considered to be without physiological or clinical significance.Cosyntropin combines with a specific receptor in the adrenal cell plasma membrane and, in patients with normal adrenocortical function, stimulates the initial reaction involved in the synthesis of adrenal steroids (including cortisol, cortisone, weak androgenic substances, and a limited quantity of aldosterone) from cholesterol by increasing the quantity of the substrate within the mitochondria. Cosyntropin does not significantly increase plasma cortisol concentration in patients with primary or secondary adrenocortical insufficiency. "

Purified corticotropin for injection is indicated for a variety of allergic and autoimmune conditions.[L39150]Corticotropin (ACTH or adrenocorticotropic hormone) is a polypeptide hormone produced and secreted by the pituitary gland. It is an important player in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.Corticotropin acts through the stimulation of cell surface ACTH receptors, which are primarily located on the adrenocortical cells. Corticotropin stimulates the cortex of the adrenal gland and boosts the synthesis of corticosteroids, mainly glucocorticoids but also sex steroids (androgens). Corticotropin is also related to the circadian rhythm in many organisms.As a diagnostic aid (adrenocortical function), corticotropin combines with a specific receptor on the adrenal cell plasma membrane. In patients with normal adrenocortical function, it stimulates the initial reaction involved in the synthesis of adrenal steroids (including cortisol, cortisone, weak androgenic substances, and a limited quantity of aldosterone) from cholesterol by increasing the quantity of cholesterol within the mitochondria. Corticotropin does not significantly increase serum cortisol concentrations in patients with primary adrenocortical insufficiency (Addison's disease). The mechanism of action of corticotropin in the treatment of infantile myoclonic seizures is unknown."

868,"Bismuth subsalicylate is indicated to temporarily relieve diarrhea, travelers' diarrhea, and upset stomach due to overindulgence in food and drink, including heartburn, indigestion, nausea, gas, belching, and fullness.[L32318]    Bismuth subsalicylate is a component of HELIDAC Therapy (bismuth subsalicylate, [metronidazole], and [tetracycline]), which is a treatment regimen indicated for the eradication of _H. pylori_ for treatment of patients with _H. pylori_ infection and duodenal ulcer disease.[L32363]Bismuth subsalicylate is an antacid and anti-diarrheal agent. Exhibiting antibacterial and gastroprotective properties, bismuth subsalicylate is an insoluble salt of [salicylic acid] linked to trivalent [bismuth cation]. Each molecule of bismuth subsalicylate contains 58% bismuth and 42% salicylate by weight.[A230733] Bismuth subsalicylate has been around for over 100 years: it was originally developed in 1901 for hygienic use and sanitation for cholera infection.[A230728, A230773]    Bismuth subsalicylate was first approved by the FDA in 1939 and is now mainly used to relieve nausea, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal discomfort.[A230728] It is an active ingredient found in Pepto-Bismol, a common over-the-counter medication that is used to temporarily treat discomforts of the stomach and gastrointestinal tract.[L32318] Bismuth subsalicylate is a component of HELIDAC Therapy (bismuth subsalicylate, [metronidazole], and [tetracycline]), which is a treatment regimen indicated for the eradication of _H. pylori_ for treatment of patients with _H. pylori_ infection and duodenal ulcer disease.[L32363]Bismuth subsalicylate is an antacid and antimicrobial, gastroprotective, anti-secretory, and anti-inflammatory actions.[A2350, A230728, A230738] It works to reduce the severity and incidence of flatulence and diarrhea, and consequently relieving gastrointestinal discomfort.[A230728] In one study, bismuth subsalicylate was prevented traveler's diarrhea with a protection rate >60%.[A230963]    Organobismuth compounds, formed by the breakdown of bismuth subsalicylate in the gastrointestinal tract, inhibit the growth of _Helicobacter pylori_ and other bacteria implicated in gastrointestinal disorders, and some fungi.[A230763] In one study, bismuth subsalicylate was shown to eradicate up to 90% of _H. pylori_ infection when used as part of a quadruple therapy regimen containing a proton pump inhibitor, tetracycline, and metronidazole.[A230728, A230768] Bismuth subsalicylate exhibited antimicrobial activity against _Clostridium difficile_, enterotoxigenic _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7, _norovirus_, and other common enteric pathogens such as _Salmonella_ and _Shigella_.[A230963]The exact mechanism of bismuth subsalicylate is not fully understood. Bismuth subsalicylate is an insoluble complex that constitutes salicylic acid and trivalent bismuth. Once orally administered, bismuth subsalicylate hydrolyzes in the stomach into bismuth oxychloride, which is minimally absorbed into the bloodstream, and salicylic acid, which is almost completely absorbed. Bismuth interacts with other anions and compounds, such as hydrochloric acid, bicarbonate, phosphate, and hydrogen sulfide, in the gastrointestinal tract to form bismuth salts such as bismuth oxychloride, bismuth subcarbonate, bismuth phosphate, and bismuth sulfide.[A230728, A230733] Bismuth salts possess bactericidal and antimicrobial activity, mainly by preventing bacteria from binding and growing on the mucosal cells of the stomach. It has no effects on normal gut flora. By preventing bacteria from binding to mucosal cells, bismuth subsalicylate prevents intestinal secretion and fluid loss, promotes fluid and electrolyte reabsorption, reduces gastrointestinal inflammation, and promotes the healing of pre-existing ulcer in the stomach. Salicylic acid from dissociated bismuth subsalicylate adds to the anti-inflammatory actions of bismuth salts by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase enzyme and limiting the formation of prostaglandin, a pro-inflammatory mediator. Bismuth subsalicylate exhibits cytoprotective and demulcent activity, which makes it an effective drug in peptic ulcer disease. It blocks the adhesion of H. pylori to the gastric epithelial cells and blocks the bacteria's enzyme activities, including phospholipase, protease, and urease.[A230728]"
869,"Used in the emergency treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.A beta-adrenergic antagonist that has been used in the emergency treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.Practolol is a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist that has been used in the emergency treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. Beta blockers inhibit normal epinephrine-mediated sympathetic  actions, but have minimal effect on resting subjects. That is, they reduce the effect of excitement/physical exertion on heart rate and force of contraction and dilation of blood vessels.Like other beta-adrenergic antagonists, practolol competes with adrenergic neurotransmitters such as catecholamines for binding at sympathetic receptor sites. Like propranolol and timolol, practolol binds at beta(1)-adrenergic receptors in the heart and vascular smooth muscle, inhibiting the effects of the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine and decreasing heart rate, cardiac output, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure."
870,"Sulfadoxine is used in combination with pyrimethamine for the treatment or prevention of malaria. It can also be used to treat various infections in livestock as well.  Sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine is indicated for the treatment of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in those patients in whom chloroquine resistance is suspected. A long acting sulfonamide that is used, usually in combination with other drugs, for respiratory, urinary tract, and malarial infections.Sulfadoxine helps inhibit the enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase which is an enzyme necessary in the conversion of PABA to folic acid. As folic acid is vital to the synthesis, repair, and methylation of DNA which is vital to cell growth in Plasmodium falciparum. With this vital nutrient lacking, the parasite has difficulty in reproducing.Sulfadoxine is a sulfa drug, often used in combination with pyrimethamine  to treat malaria. This medicine may also be used to prevent malaria in people who are living in, or will be traveling to, an area where there is a chance of getting malaria. Sulfadoxine targets Plasmodium dihydropteroate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase.  Sulfa drugs or Sulfonamides are antimetabolites.  They compete with para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) for incorporation into folic acid. The action of sulfonamides exploits the difference between mammal cells and other kinds of cells in their folic acid metabolism. All cells require folic acid for growth. Folic acid (as a vitamin) diffuses or is transported into human cells. However, folic acid cannot cross bacterial (and certain protozoan) cell walls by diffusion or active transport. For this reason bacteria must synthesize folic acid from p-aminobenzoic acid."

Rolitetracycline passively diffuses through porin channels in the bacterial membrane and reversibly binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit, preventing binding of tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex, and thus interfering with protein synthesis."
872,"Used to treat the symptoms of asthma, bronchitis, COPD, and emphysema.Oxtriphylline is the choline salt form of [theophylline]. Once in the body, theophylline is released and acts as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, adenosine receptor blocker, and histone deacetylase activator. Its main physiological reponse is to dilate the bronchioles. As such, oxytriphylline is indicated mainly for asthma, bronchospasm, and COPD (i.e. all the same indications as the other theophyllines). It is marketed under the name Choledyl SA, and several forms of oxytriphylline have been discontinued. In the US, oxtriphylline is no longer available.Oxtriphylline is a bronchodilator. Oxtriphylline works in several ways: it relaxes muscles in your lungs and chest to allow more air in, decreases the sensitivity of your lungs to allergens and other substances that cause inflammation, and increases the contractions of your diaphragm to draw more air into the lungs.Oxtriphylline is a choline salt of theophylline. After ingestion, theophylline is released from oxytriphylline, and theophylline relaxes the smooth muscle of the bronchial airways and pulmonary blood vessels and reduces airway responsiveness to histamine, methacholine, adenosine, and allergen. Theophylline competitively inhibits type III and type IV phosphodiesterase (PDE), the enzyme responsible for breaking down cyclic AMP in smooth muscle cells, possibly resulting in bronchodilation. Theophylline also binds to the adenosine A2B receptor and blocks adenosine mediated bronchoconstriction. In inflammatory states, theophylline activates histone deacetylase to prevent transcription of inflammatory genes that require the acetylation of histones for transcription to begin.  "
873,"Insulin aspart is indicated to improve glycemic control in adults and children with diabetes mellitus.[L12273,L42550]Insulin aspart is a rapid-acting form of insulin used for the treatment of hyperglycemia caused by Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes. Insulin is typically prescribed for the management of diabetes mellitus to mimic the activity of endogenously produced human insulin, a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas that promotes glucose metabolism. Insulin is released from the pancreas following a meal to promote the uptake of glucose from the blood into internal organs and tissues such as the liver, fat cells, and skeletal muscle. Absorption of glucose into cells allows for its transformation into glycogen or fat for storage. Insulin also inhibits hepatic glucose production, enhances protein synthesis, and inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis among many other functions.    Insulin is an important treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce or synthesize the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels. As a result, people with T1D rely primarily on exogenous forms of insulin, such as insulin aspart, to lower glucose levels in the blood. Insulin is also used in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), another form of diabetes mellitus that is a slowly progressing metabolic disorder caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors that promote chronically elevated blood sugar levels. Without treatment or improvement in non-pharmacological measures such as diet and exercise to lower blood glucose, high blood sugar eventually causes cellular resistance to endogenous insulin, and in the long term, damage to pancreatic islet cells. Marketed as the brand name product NovoRapid, insulin aspart begins to exert its effects within 15 minutes of subcutaneous administration, while peak levels occur 30 to 90 minutes after administration. Due to its duration of action of around 5 hours, NovoRapid is considered ""bolus insulin"" as it provides high levels of insulin in a short period of time to mimic the release of endogenous insulin from the pancreas after meals. Bolus insulin is often combined with once daily, long-acting ""basal insulin"" such as [DB01307], [DB09564], and [DB00047] to provide low concentrations of background insulin that can keep blood sugar stable between meals or overnight. Use of basal and bolus insulin together is intended to mimic the pancreas' production of endogenous insulin, with a goal of avoiding any periods of hypoglycemia.    Insulin aspart is a recombinant, biosynthetic, fast-acting insulin analogue. Compared to human insulin, it has a single amino acid substitution at position B28 where proline is replaced with aspartic acid. This substitution decreases its propensity to form hexamers and gives it a higher rate of absorption following subcutaneous administration compared to native insulin. Insulin aspart is produced in a genetically modified strain of _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ (baker's yeast)    Without an adequate supply of insulin to promote absorption of glucose from the bloodstream, blood sugar levels can climb to dangerously high levels and can result in symptoms such as fatigue, headache, blurred vision, and increased thirst. If left untreated, the body starts to break down fat, instead of glucose, for energy which results in a build-up of ketone acids in the blood and a syndrome called ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening medical emergency. In the long term, elevated blood sugar levels increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and diabetic neuropathy.Insulin is a natural hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas. In non-diabetic individuals, a basal level of insulin is supplemented with insulin spikes following meals. Postprandial insulin spikes are responsible for the metabolic changes that occur as the body transitions from a postabsorptive to absorptive state. Insulin promotes cellular uptake of glucose, particularly in muscle and adipose tissues, promotes energy storage via glycogenesis, opposes catabolism of energy stores, increases DNA replication and protein synthesis by stimulating amino acid uptake by liver, muscle and adipose tissue, and modifies the activity of numerous enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. Insulin also promotes growth and is required for the actions of growth hormone (e.g. protein synthesis, cell division, DNA synthesis). Insulin aspart is a rapid-acting insulin analogue used to mimic postprandial insulin spikes in diabetic individuals. The onset of action of insulin aspart is 10-15 minutes. Its activity peaks 60-90 minutes following subcutaneous injection and its duration of action is 4-5 hours.Insulin aspart binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor autophosphorylates and phosphorylates numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. Activation of these proteins leads to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC), both of which play critical roles in metabolism and catabolism. In humans, insulin is stored in the form of hexamers; however, only insulin monomers are able to interact with IR. Substitution of the proline residue at B28 with aspartic acid reduces the tendency to form hexamers and results in a faster rate of absorption and onset of action and shorter duration of action. "

The myristoyl side chain increases self-association and albumin binding.[A2358, A2359, A2360, A44] This along with slow systemic absorption from the injection site prolongs distribution of the hormone into tissues and results in a long duration of action. [A2358, A2359, A2360, A44]    Without an adequate supply of insulin to promote absorption of glucose from the bloodstream, blood sugar levels can climb to dangerously high levels and can result in symptoms such as fatigue, headache, blurred vision, and increased thirst.[A2358, A2359, A2360, A44] If left untreated, the body starts to break down fat, instead of glucose, for energy which results in a build-up of ketone acids in the blood and a syndrome called ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening medical emergency. In the long term, elevated blood sugar levels increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and diabetic neuropathy.[A2358, A2359, A2360, A44]Insulin is a natural hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas.[A2360] In non-diabetic individuals, the pancreas produces a continuous supply of low levels of basal insulin along with spikes of insulin following meals.[A2360,A2359] Increased insulin secretion following meals is responsible for the metabolic changes that occur as the body transitions from a postabsorptive to absorptive state.[A2360,A2359] Insulin promotes cellular uptake of glucose, particularly in muscle and adipose tissues, promotes energy storage via glycogenesis, opposes catabolism of energy stores, increases DNA replication and protein synthesis by stimulating amino acid uptake by the liver, muscle and adipose tissue, and modifies the activity of numerous enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis and glycolysis.[A2360,A2359] Insulin also promotes growth and is required for the actions of growth hormone (e.g. protein synthesis, cell division, DNA synthesis).[A2360,A2359] Insulin detemir is a long-acting insulin analogue with a flat and predictable action profile.[A2360,A2359] It is used to mimic the basal levels of insulin in diabetic individuals.

These features slow its distribution into target tissues and prolong its duration of action.[A231654] "
875,"Insulin glulisine is indicated to improve glycemic control in adults and pediatric patients with diabetes mellitus.Insulin glulisine is a short-acting form of insulin used for the treatment of hyperglycemia caused by Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes. Insulin is typically prescribed for the management of diabetes mellitus to mimic the activity of endogenously produced human insulin, a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas that promotes glucose metabolism. Insulin is released from the pancreas following a meal to promote the uptake of glucose from the blood into internal organs and tissues such as the liver, fat cells, and skeletal muscle. Absorption of glucose into cells allows for its transformation into glycogen or fat for storage. Insulin also inhibits hepatic glucose production, enhances protein synthesis, and inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis among many other functions.    Insulin is an important treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce or synthesize the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels. As a result, people with T1D rely primarily on exogenous forms of insulin, such as insulin glulisine, to lower glucose levels in the blood. Insulin is also used in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), another form of diabetes mellitus that is a slowly progressing metabolic disorder caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors that promote chronically elevated blood sugar levels. Without treatment or improvement in non-pharmacological measures such as diet and exercise to lower blood glucose, high blood sugar eventually causes cellular resistance to endogenous insulin, and in the long term, damage to pancreatic islet cells. Insulin is typically prescribed later in the course of T2D, after trying several oral medications such as [DB00331], [DB01120], or [DB01261] have been tried, when sufficient damage has been caused to pancreatic cells that the body is no longer able to produce insulin on its own.     Marketed as the brand name product Apidra, insulin glulisine begins to exert its effects within 15 minutes of subcutaneous administration, while peak levels occur 30 to 90 minutes after administration. Due to its duration of action of around 5 hours, Apidra is considered ""bolus insulin"" as it provides high levels of insulin in a short period of time to mimic the release of endogenous insulin from the pancreas after meals. Bolus insulin is often combined with once daily, long-acting ""basal insulin"" such as [DB01307], [DB09564], and [DB00047] to provide low concentrations of background insulin that can keep blood sugar stable between meals or overnight. Use of basal and bolus insulin together is intended to mimic the pancreas' production of endogenous insulin, with a goal of avoiding any periods of hypoglycemia.    Insulin glulisine is a biosynthetic, rapid-acting human insulin analogue produced in a non-pathogenic laboratory strain of _Escherichia coli_ (K12). This recombinant hormone differs from native human insulin in that the amino acid asparagine at position B3 is replaced by lysine and the lysine at position B29 is replaced by glutamic acid.[L12519] These structural modifications decrease hexamer formation, stabilize insulin glulisine monomers and increase the rate of absorption and onset of action compared to human insulin.    Without an adequate supply of insulin to promote absorption of glucose from the bloodstream, blood sugar levels can climb to dangerously high levels and can result in symptoms such as fatigue, headache, blurred vision, and increased thirst. If left untreated, the body starts to break down fat, instead of glucose, for energy which results in a build-up of ketone acids in the blood and a syndrome called ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening medical emergency. In the long term, elevated blood sugar levels increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and diabetic neuropathy.Insulin is a natural hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas. In non-diabetic individuals, a basal level of insulin is supplemented with insulin spikes following meals. Postprandial insulin spikes are responsible for the metabolic changes that occur as the body transitions from a postabsorptive to absorptive state. Insulin promotes cellular uptake of glucose, particularly in muscle and adipose tissues, promotes energy storage via glycogenesis, opposes catabolism of energy stores, increases DNA replication and protein synthesis by stimulating amino acid uptake by liver, muscle and adipose tissue, and modifies the activity of numerous enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. Insulin also promotes growth and is required for the actions of growth hormone (e.g. protein synthesis, cell division, DNA synthesis). Insulin glulisine is a rapid-acting insulin analogue used to mimic postprandial insulin spikes in diabetic individuals. The onset of action of insulin glulisine is approximately 15 minutes. Its activity peaks 60 minutes following subcutaneous injection and its duration of action is 2-4 hours.Insulin glulisine binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor autophosphorylates and phosphorylates numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. Activation of these proteins leads to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC), both of which play critical roles in metabolism and catabolism. In humans, insulin is stored in the form of hexamers; however, only insulin monomers are able to interact with IR. Substitution of the arginine at position B3 for lysine and replacement of the B29 lysine with glutamic acid decreases the propensity to form hexamers, stabilizes the hormone in monomeric form and results in a rapid rate of absorption and short duration of action.

876,"The use of fosamprenavir is pending revision due to a potential association between the drug and myocardial infarction and dyslipidemia in HIV infected adults.Fosamprenavir is a prodrug of amprenavir, an inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease.Fosamprenavir is hydrolyzed by cellular phosphatases to the antiretroviral protease inhibitor amprenavir. This hydrolysis allows for the slow release of amprenavir, reducing the number of pills a patient must take.Fosamprenavir is a prodrug that is rapidly hydrolyzed to amprenavir by cellular phosphatases in the gut epithelium as it is absorbed. Amprenavir is an inhibitor of HIV-1 protease. During HIV replication, HIV protease cleaves viral polypeptide products of the Gag and Gag-Pol genes to form structural proteins of the virion core and essential viral enzymes. Amprenavir interferes with this process by binding to the active site of HIV-1 protease, thereby preventing the processing of viral Gag and Gag-Pol polyprotein precursors, resulting in the formation of immature non-infectious viral particles."
877,"Fosphenytoin is indicated for the treatment of generalized tonic-clonic status epilepticus and for the prevention and treatment of seizures occurring during neurosurgery in adult patients. It can also be substituted, short-term, for oral phenytoin in patients aged two years and older when oral phenytoin administration is not possible.[L20619]Fosphenytoin is a water-soluble phenytoin prodrug used only in hospitals for the treatment of epileptic seizures. It works by slowing down impulses in the brain that cause seizures. Its main mechanism is to block frequency-dependent, use-dependent and voltage-dependent neuronal sodium channels, and therefore limit repetitive firing of action potentials.Fosphenytoin is a water-soluble phenytoin prodrug used for the treatment of epileptic seizures. Following parenteral administration of fosphenytoin, fosphenytoin is converted to the anticonvulsant phenytoin by endogenous phosphatases. Each 1.5 mg of fosphenytoin sodium is equivalent to 1.0mg of phenytoin sodium (PE equivalents); care should be taken to calculate the dose required in PE equivalents properly. Serious adverse effects such as Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome/Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (SJS/TEN), and hematopoietic complications may occur and indicate an alternate antiepileptic should be used. Withdrawal of fosphenytoin sodium may precipitate seizures and should be done gradually.[L20619]Fosphenytoin is a prodrug of phenytoin and accordingly, its anticonvulsant effects are attributable to phenytoin. Phenytoin acts on sodium channels on the neuronal cell membrane, limiting the spread of seizure activity and reducing seizure propagation. By promoting sodium efflux from neurons, phenytoin tends to stabilize the threshold against hyperexcitability caused by excessive stimulation or environmental changes capable of reducing membrane sodium gradient. This includes the reduction of post-tetanic potentiation at synapses. Loss of post-tetanic potentiation prevents cortical seizure foci from detonating adjacent cortical areas."

The drug has antimicrobial activity against a wide spectrum of pathogens.Josamycin is a macrolide antibiotic from Streptomyces narbonensis. The drug has antimicrobial activity against a wide spectrum of pathogens. The mechanism of action of macrolides such as Josamycin is via inhibition of bacterial protein biosynthesis by binding reversibly to the subunit 50S of the bacterial ribosome, thereby inhibiting translocation of peptidyl tRNA. This action is mainly bacteriostatic, but can also be bactericidal in high concentrations. Macrolides tend to accumulate within leukocytes, and are therefore actually transported into the site of infection."
879,"Polythiazide is a thiazide diuretic used to decrease edema and decrease blood pressure.A thiazide diuretic with actions and uses similar to those of hydrochlorothiazide. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p826)As a thiazide diuretic, Polythiazide inhibits the sodium-chloride symporter  which decreases solute reabsorption leading to a retention of water in the urine, as water normally follows solutes. More frequent urination is due to the increased loss of water that has not been retained from the body as a result of a concomitant relationship with sodium loss from the convoluted tubule. The short-term anti-hypertensive action is based on the fact that thiazides decrease preload, decreasing blood pressureAs a diuretic, polythiazide inhibits active chloride reabsorption at the early distal tubule via the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter (TSC), resulting in an increase in the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water. Thiazides like polythiazide also inhibit sodium ion transport across the renal tubular epithelium through binding to the thiazide sensitive sodium-chloride transporter. This results in an increase in potassium excretion via the sodium-potassium exchange mechanism. The antihypertensive mechanism of polythiazide may be mediated through its action on carbonic anhydrases in the smooth muscle or through its action on the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (KCa) channel, also found in the smooth muscle."

Patients may experience adverse reactions such as dizziness, dry mouth, nausea, and hypokalemia.Quinethazone is a thiazide diuretic used to treat hypertension.  It inhibits Na+/Cl- reabsorption from the distal convoluted tubules in the kidneys. Thiazides also cause loss of potassium and an increase in serum uric acid. Thiazides are often used to treat hypertension, but their hypotensive effects are not necessarily due to their diuretic activity. Thiazides have been shown to prevent hypertension-related morbidity and mortality although the mechanism is not fully understood. Thiazides cause vasodilation by activating calcium-activated potassium channels (large conductance) in vascular smooth muscles and inhibiting various carbonic anhydrases in vascular tissue.As a diuretic, quinethazone inhibits active chloride reabsorption at the early distal tubule via the Na-Cl cotransporter, resulting in an increase in the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water. Thiazides like quinethazone also inhibit sodium ion transport across the renal tubular epithelium through binding to the thiazide sensitive sodium-chloride transporter. This results in an increase in potassium excretion via the sodium-potassium exchange mechanism.

887,"Cilazapril is an ACE inhibtor class drug used in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure.Cilazapril is an ACE inhibtor class drug used in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. It belongs to the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) class of drugs.  It is a prodrug that is hydrolyzed after absorption to its main metabolite cilazaprilat. It is branded as Inhibace in Canada and other countries, Vascace and Dynorm in a number of European countries, among many other names. None of these varieties are available in the United States.Cilazapril inhibits the production angiotensin II. By doing so, it decreases sodium and water reabsorption (via aldosterone) and it decreases vasoconstriction. The combined effect of this is a decrease in vascular resistance, and therefore, blood pressure. The absolute bioavailability of cilazaprilat after oral administration of cilazapril is 57% based on urinary recovery data. (The absolute bioavailability of cilazaprilat after oral administration of cilazaprilat is 19%.) Ingestion of food immediately before the administration of cilazapril reduces the average peak plasma concentration of cilazaprilat by 29%, delays the peak by one hour and reduces the bioavailability of cilazaprilat by 14%. These pharmacokinetic changes have little influence on plasma ACE inhibition. Cilazapril is a pyridazine ACE inhibitor. It competes with angiotensin I for binding at the angiotensin-converting enzyme, blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. As angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor and a negative feedback mediator for renin activity, lower angiotensin II levels results in a decrease in blood pressure, an increase in renin activity, and stimulation of baroreceptor reflex mechanisms. Kininase II, an enzyme which degrades the vasodilator bradykinin, is identical to ACE and may also be inhibited."
888,"For the treatment of hypertension.Forasartan, a specific angiotensin II antagonist, is used to treat hypertension. Forasartan competes with angiotensin II for binding at the AT1 receptor subtype. As angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor which also stimulates the synthesis and release of aldosterone, blockage of its effects results in a decreases in systemic vascular resistance.By inhibiting angiotensin II receptors, this drug leads to a decrease in sodium reabsorption (which decreases water content of blood) and a decrease in vasoconstriction. Combined, this has the effect of lowering blood pressure.Forasartan competes with angiotensin II for binding at the AT1 receptor subtype. As angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor which also stimulates the synthesis and release of aldosterone, blockage of its effects results in a decreases in systemic vascular resistance. Also, since angiotensin causes vasoconstriction, the inhibition of this receptor decreases vasoconstriction, which consequently also decreases vascular resistnace."

Spirapril is converted to the active spiraprilat after administration. ACE inhibitors are used primarily in treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure.Spirapril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. By blocking ACE, spirapril decreases angiotensin II which is a vasoconstrictor and inducer of aldosterone. So by inhibiting the enzymes, aldosterone secreation is decreased (so less sodium is reabsorbed) and there is a decrease in vasoconstriction. Combined, this leades to a decrease in blood pressure.Spiraprilat, the active metabolite of spirapril, competes with angiotensin I for binding at the angiotensin-converting enzyme, blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II. As angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor and a negative-feedback mediator for renin activity, lower concentrations result in a decrease in blood pressure and stimulation of baroreceptor reflex mechanisms, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. Spiraprilat may also act on kininase II, an enzyme identical to ACE that degrades the vasodilator bradykinin."
890,"A barbiturate with hypnotic and sedative properties (but not antianxiety). Adverse effects are mainly a consequence of dose-related CNS depression and the risk of dependence with continued use is high. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p565)Amobarbital (like all barbiturates) works by binding to the GABAA receptor at either the alpha or the beta sub unit.  These are binding sites that are distinct from GABA itself and also distinct from the benzodiazepine binding site. Like benzodiazepines, barbiturates potentiate the effect of GABA at this receptor.  This GABAA receptor binding decreases input resistance, depresses burst and tonic firing, especially in ventrobasal and intralaminar neurons, while at the same time increasing burst duration and mean conductance at individual chloride channels; this increases both the amplitude and decay time of inhibitory postsynaptic currents.  In addition to this GABA-ergic effect, barbiturates also block the AMPA receptor, a subtype of glutamate receptor. Glutamate is the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian CNS.  Amobarbital also appears to bind neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. "
891,"Aprobarbital is a barbiturate derivative synthesized in the 1920s by Ernst Preiswerk. It was determined that the substance was capable of demonstrating sedative, hypnotic, and anticonvulsant effects. A primary treatment indicated for the use of aprobarbital was subsequently insomnia.

892,"For the treatment of insomnia.Butobarbital is a sedative and a hypnotic drug.Butethal (also known as butobarbitone and butobarbital) belongs to a group of medicines called the barbiturates. It is thought to act on receptors in the brain (GABA receptors) causing the release of the chemical GABA. This chemical inhibits certain areas of the brain resulting in sleepiness. Butethal binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl  ionopore at the GABAA receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl  ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged. All of these effects are associated with marked decreases in GABA-sensitive neuronal calcium conductance (gCa). The net result of barbiturate action is acute potentiation of inhibitory GABAergic tone. Barbiturates also act through potent (if less well characterized) and direct inhibition of excitatory AMPA-type glutamate receptors, resulting in a profound suppression of glutamatergic neurotransmission.

It was subsequently used in the 1940s and 1950s as an anesthetic for surgery. Furthermore, the agent also demonstrates a fairly quick onset of action that also possesses a short duration of action. However it can be difficult to control the depth of anesthesia with hexobarbital which makes it quite dangerous, and it has now been replaced by safer drugs in human medicine, usually thiopental would be the barbiturate of choice for this application these days.Hexobarbital binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl- ionopore at the GABA-A receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl- ionopore is open.

Mestranol is a biologically inactive prodrug of ethinylestradiol to which it is demethylated in the liver with a conversion efficiency of 70%.    Estrogens diffuse into their target cells and interact with a protein receptor. Target cells include the female reproductive tract, the mammary gland, the hypothalamus, and the pituitary. Estrogens increase the hepatic synthesis of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), thyroid-binding globulin (TBG), and other serum proteins and suppress follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary. The combination of an estrogen with a progestin suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary system, decreasing the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)."
895,"Penbutolol is indicated in the treatment of mild to moderate arterial hypertension. Penbutolol is contraindicated in patients with cardiogenic shock, sinus bradycardia, second and third degree atrioventricular conduction block, bronchial asthma, and those with known hypersensitivity.Penbutolol is a drug in the beta-blocker class used to treat hypertension. Penbutolol binds both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors, rendering it a non-selective beta-blocker. Penbutolol can act as a partial agonist at beta adrenergic receptors, since it is a sympathomimetric drug. Penbutolol also demonstrates high binding affinity to the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1A with antagonistic effects. This binding characteristic of penbutolol is being investigated for its implications in Antidepressant Therapy. Penbutolol is contraindicated in patients with cardiogenic shock, sinus bradycardia, second and third degree atrioventricular conduction block, bronchial asthma, and those with known hypersensitivity.Penbutolol is a ß-1, ß-2 (nonselective) adrenergic receptor antagonist. Experimental studies showed a dose-dependent increase in heart rate in reserpinized (norepinephrine-depleted) rats given penbutolol intravenously at doses of 0.25 to 1.0 mg/kg, suggesting that penbutolol has some intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. In human studies, however, heart rate decreases have been similar to those seen with propranolol.Penbutolol acts on the β1 adrenergic receptors in both the heart and the kidney. When β1 receptors are activated by catecholamines, they stimulate a coupled G protein that leads to the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The increase in cAMP leads to activation of protein kinase A (PKA), which alters the movement of calcium ions in heart muscle and increases the heart rate. Penbutolol blocks the catecholamine activation of β1 adrenergic receptors and decreases heart rate, which lowers blood pressure."
896,"Iohexol ia used in myelography, arthrography, nephroangiography, arteriography, and other radiographic procedures.Iohexol is an effective non-ionic, water-soluble contrast agent which is used in myelography, arthrography, nephroangiography, arteriography, and other radiographic procedures. Its low systemic toxicity is the combined result of low chemotoxicity and low osmolality.Iohexol is an effective non-ionic, water-soluble contrast agent which is used in myelography, arthrography, nephroangiography, arteriography, and other radiographic procedures. Its low systemic toxicity is the combined result of low chemotoxicity and low osmolality.Organic iodine compounds block x-rays as they pass through the body, thereby allowing body structures containing iodine to be delineated in contrast to those structures that do not contain iodine. The degree of opacity produced by these compounds is directly proportional to the total amount (concentration and volume) of the iodinated contrast agent in the path of the x-rays. After intrathecal administration into the subarachnoid space, diffusion of iohexol in the CSF allows the visualization of the subarachnoid spaces of the head and spinal canal. After intravascular administration, iohexol makes opaque those vessels in its path of flow, allowing visualization of the internal structures until significant hemodilution occurs."
897,"Ephedrine intravenous injections are indicated to treat hypotension under anesthesia,[L12972,L34645] ephedrine injections by multiple routes are indicated to treat allergic conditions such as bronchial asthma,[L12996] ephedrine nasal spray is and OTC medication used as a decongestant.[L12993]Ephedrine was first described in western literature in 1888, as a naturally occurring component of the ephedra plant, along with [pseudoephedrine].[A193698] Ephedrine acts as both a direct and indirect sympathomimetic. It is an alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor agonist; however, it also causes the indirect release of norepinephrine from sympathetic neurons, inhibiting norepinephrine reuptake and displacing more norepinephrine from storage vesicles.[A193650,L12972] Ephedrine is used for its vasoconstrictive, positive chronotropic, and positive inotropic effects.[L12972] Ephedrine and [phenylephrine] are still used to treat hypotension, but their use in other indications has decreased due to the development of more selective adrenergic agonists.[A193701,A193704,L12975] Ephedrine was granted a type 7 FDA Approval on 29 April 2016.[L12975]Ephedrine increases blood pressure by stimulating heart rate and cardiac output and variably increasing peripheral resistance.[L12975] It causes bronchodilation due to the activation of beta-adrenergic receptors in the lungs. By stimulating alpha-adrenergic receptors in bladder smooth muscle cells, ephedrine also increases the resistance to the outflow of urine.[L12972,L12975] The therapeutic window of ephedrine is wide, as patients can be given doses of 5mg up to 50mg.[L12993] Patients should be counselled regarding the pressor effects of sympathomimetic amines and the risk of tachyphylaxis.[A193650] Also, the use of ephedrine for hypotension prophylaxis is associated with a higher risk of hypertension, compared to when ephedrine is used to treat hypotension.[L12975]Ephedrine is a direct and indirect sympathomimetic amine.[A193650] As a direct effect, ephedrine activates alpha-adrenergic and beta-adrenergic receptors. As an indirect effect, it inhibits norepinephrine reuptake and increases the release of norepinephrine from vesicles in nerve cells.[A193650] These actions combined lead to larger quantities of norepinephrine present in the synapse for more extended periods of time, increasing stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system.[A193650]    Ephedrine acts as an agonist of alpha-1, beta-1 and beta-2-adrenergic receptors. The stimulation of alpha-1-adrenergic receptors causes the constriction of veins and a rise in blood pressure, the stimulation of beta-1-adrenergic receptors increases cardiac chronotropy and inotropy, and the stimulation of beta-2-adrenergic receptors causes vasodilation and bronchodilation.[A193650]"
898,"Used to maintain blood pressure in hypotensive states.A sympathomimetic agent with mainly indirect effects on adrenergic receptors. It is used to maintain blood pressure in hypotensive states, for example, following spinal anesthesia. Although the central stimulant effects of mephentermine are much less than those of amphetamine, its use may lead to amphetamine-type dependence. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p1248)Mephentermine is a sympathomimetic agent with mainly indirect effects on adrenergic receptors. It is used to maintain blood pressure in hypotensive states, for example, following spinal anesthesia. Although the central stimulant effects of mephentermine are much less than those of amphetamine, its use may lead to amphetamine-type dependence. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p1248)Mephentermine is an alpha adrenergic receptor agonist, but also acts indirectly by releasing endogenous norepinephrine. Cardiac output and systolic and diastolic pressures are usually increased. A change in heart rate is variable, depending on the degree of vagal tone. Sometimes the net vascular effect may be vasodilation. Large doses may depress the myocardium or produce central nervous system (CNS) effects."
899,"For the treatment of the signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinsons disease as initial monotherapy and as adjunct therapy to levodopa.Rasagiline is an irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase and is used as a monotherapy in early Parkinson's disease or as an adjunct therapy in more advanced cases.Rasagiline is a propargylamine and an irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO). MAO, a flavin-containing enzyme, regulates the metabolic degradation of catecholamines and serotonin in the CNS and peripheral tissues. It is classified into two major molecular species, A and B, and is localized in mitochondrial membranes throughout the body in nerve terminals, brain, liver and intestinal mucosa. MAO-A is found predominantly in the GI tract and liver, and regulates the metabolic degradation of circulating catecholamines and dietary amines. MAO-B is the major form in the human brain and is responsible for the regulation of the metabolic degradation of dopamine and phenylethylamine. In ex vivo animal studies in brain, liver and intestinal tissues rasagiline was shown to be a potent,selective, and irreversible monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) inhibitor. At the recommended therapeutic doses, Rasagiline was also shown to be a potent and irreversible inhibitor of MAO-B in platelets. The selectivity of rasagiline for inhibiting only MAO-B (and not MAO-A) in humans and the sensitivity to tyramine during rasagiline treatment at any dose has not been sufficiently characterized to avoid restriction of dietary tyramine and amines contained in medications.The precise mechanisms of action of rasagiline is unknown. One mechanism is believed to be related to its MAO-B inhibitory activity, which causes an increase in extracellular levels of dopamine in the striatum. The elevated dopamine level and subsequent increased dopaminergic activity are likely to mediate rasagiline's beneficial effects seen in models of dopaminergic motor dysfunction."
900,"For the treatment of bacterial infections (usually in combination with dalfopristin).Quinupristin/dalfopristin is a combination of two antibiotics used to treat infections by staphylococci and by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. Dalfopristin inhibits the early phase of protein synthesis in the bacterial ribosome and quinupristin inhibits the late phase of protein synthesis. The combination of the two components acts synergistically and is more effective in vitro than each component alone.Quinupristin is a streptogramin antibiotic, derived from pristinamycin I. By inhibiting the bacterial ribosomal subunits, protein synthesis is inhibited thus leading to eventual bacterial cell death or stasis.Quinupristin inhibits the late phase of protein synthesis in the bacterial ribosome. Dalfopristin binds to the 23S portion of the 50S ribosomal subunit, and changes the conformation it, enhancing the binding of quinupristin by a factor of about 100. In addition, it inhibits peptidyl transferase. Quinupristin binds to a nearby site on the 50S ribosomal subunit and prevents elongation of the polypeptide as well as causing incomplete chains to be released."
901,"Indicated for over-the-counter use as a supplement for cardiovascular and neuromuscular health, and as an antacid for relief of acid indigestion and upset stomach.    Magnesium oxide, in combination with sodium picosulfate and anhydrous citric acid, is indicated for cleansing of the colon as a preparation for colonoscopy in adults and pediatric patients ages 9 years and older.[L43832]Magnesium oxide is an inorganic compound that occurs in nature as the mineral periclase. In aqueous media combines quickly with water to form magnesium hydroxide. It is used as an antacid and mild laxative and has many nonmedicinal uses.The term ""Milk of Magnesia"" was first used to describe a white aqueous, mildly alkaline suspension of magnesium hydroxide formulated at about 8%w/v. Milk of magnesia is primarily used to alleviate constipation, but can also be used to relieve indigestion and heartburn. When taken internally by mouth as a laxative, the osmotic force of the magnesia suspension acts to draw fluids from the body and to retain those already within the lumen of the intestine, serving to distend the bowel, thus stimulating nerves within the colon wall, inducing peristalsis and resulting in evacuation of colonic contents. Magnesium supplements have also been shown to reduce platelet aggregation by inhibiting in the influx of calcium, a crucial component of platelet aggregation."
902,"Cortisone acetate is indicated to treat a wide variety of endocrine, rheumatic, collagen, dermatologic, allergic, ophthalmic, respiratory, hematologic, neoplastic, edematous, and gastrointestinal diseases and disorders.[A226300,L13203]Cortisone acetate was first isolate in 1935 and became more widely researched in 1949.[A226295] Since then, glucocorticoids such as cortisone acetate have been used to treat a number of inflammatory conditions such as endocrine, rheumatic, collagen, dermatologic, allergic, ophthalmic, respiratory, hematologic, neoplastic, edematous, and gastrointestinal diseases and disorders.[A226300,L13203]    Cortisone acetate was granted FDA approval on 13 June 1950.[L15107]Corticosteroids bind to the glucocorticoid receptor, inhibiting pro-inflammatory signals, and promoting anti-inflammatory signals.[A187463] The duration of action is moderate as it is generally given once daily.[L13203] Corticosteroids have a wide therapeutic window as patients may require doses that are multiples of what the body naturally produces.[A187463] Patients taking corticosteroids should be counselled regarding the risk of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression and increased susceptibility to infections.[A187463]The short term effects of corticosteroids are decreased vasodilation and permeability of capillaries, as well as decreased leukocyte migration to sites of inflammation.[A187463] Corticosteroids binding to the glucocorticoid receptor mediates changes in gene expression that lead to multiple downstream effects over hours to days.[A187463]  Glucocorticoids inhibit neutrophil apoptosis and demargination; they inhibit phospholipase A2, which decreases the formation of arachidonic acid derivatives; they inhibit NF-Kappa B and other inflammatory transcription factors; they promote anti-inflammatory genes like interleukin-10.[A187463]  Lower doses of corticosteroids provide an anti-inflammatory effect, while higher doses are immunosuppressive.[A187463] High doses of glucocorticoids for an extended period bind to the mineralocorticoid receptor, raising sodium levels and decreasing potassium levels.[A187463]"
903,"For the treatment of all conditions in which corticosteroid therapy is indicated except adrenal-deficiency states for which its lack of sodium-retaining properties.A glucocorticoid with the general properties of corticosteroids. It has been used by mouth in the treatment of all conditions in which corticosteroid therapy is indicated except adrenal-deficiency states for which its lack of sodium-retaining properties. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p737)Paramethasone is a glucocorticoid with the general properties of corticosteroids. Glucocorticoids are a class of steroid hormones characterised by an ability to bind with the cortisol receptor and trigger a variety of important cardiovascular, metabolic, immunologic and homeostatic effects. Glucocorticoids are distinguished from mineralocorticoids and sex steroids by having different receptors, target cells, and effects. Technically, the term corticosteroid refers to both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, but is often used as a synonym for glucocorticoid. Glucocorticoids suppress cell-mediated immunity. They act by inhibiting genes that code for the cytokines IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha, the most important of which is the IL-2. Reduced cytokine production limits T cell proliferation. Glucocorticoids also suppress humoral immunity, causing B cells to express lower amounts of IL-2 and IL-2 receptors. This diminishes both B cell clonal expansion and antibody synthesis. The diminished amounts of IL-2 also leads to fewer T lymphocyte cells being activated.Glucocorticoids such as paramethasone can inhibit leukocyte infiltration at the site of inflammation, interfere with mediators of inflammatory response, and suppress humoral immune responses. The antiinflammatory actions of glucocorticoids are thought to involve phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, lipocortins, which control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Paramethasone reduces inflammatory reaction by limiting the capillary dilatation and permeability of the vascular structures. These compounds restrict the accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages and reduce the release of vasoactive kinins. Recent research suggests that corticosteroids may inhibit the release of arachidonic acid from phospholipids, thereby reducing the formation of prostaglandins. Prednisolone is a glucocorticoid receptor agonist. On binding, the corticoreceptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing an increase or decrease in expression of specific target genes, including suppression of IL2 (interleukin 2) expression."
904,"Sodium bicarbonate is used for the treatment of metabolic acidosis which may occur in severe renal disease, uncontrolled diabetes, circulatory insufficiency due to shock or severe dehydration, extracorporeal circulation of blood, cardiac arrest and severe primary lactic acidosis. Also is indicated in severe diarrhea which is often accompanied by a significant loss of bicarbonate. Further indicated in the treatment of certain drug intoxications, including barbiturates (where dissociation of the barbiturateprotein complex is desired), in poisoning by salicylates or methyl alcohol and in hemolytic reactions requiring alkalinization of the urine to diminish nephrotoxicity of blood pigments.Sodium bicarbonate is a white, crystalline powder that is commonly used as a pH buffering agent, an electrolyte replenisher, systemic alkalizer and in topical cleansing solutions.Intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy increases plasma bicarbonate, buffers excess hydrogen ion concentration, raises blood pH and reverses the clinical manifestations of acidosis.Sodium bicarbonate is a systemic alkalizer, which increases plasma bicarbonate, buffers excess hydrogen ion concentration, and raises blood pH, thereby reversing the clinical manifestations of acidosis. It is also a urinary alkalizer, increasing the excretion of free bicarbonate ions in the urine, thus effectively raising the urinary pH. By maintaining an alkaline urine, the actual dissolution of uric acid stones may be accomplished. Sodium bicarbonate acts as an antacid and reacts chemically to neutralize or buffer existing quantities of stomach acid but has no direct effect on its output. This action results in increased pH value of stomach contents, thus providing relief of hyperacidity symptoms. [PharmGKB]"
905,"For the treatment of primary hyperlipidaemia types IIa, IIb, III, IV and V (Fredrickson classification) corresponding to groups I, II and III of the European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines - when diet alone or improvements in lifestyle such as increased exercise or weight reduction do not lead to an adequate response. Also for the treatment of secondary hyperlipidaemias, e.g. severe hypertriglyceridemias, when sufficient improvement does not occur after correction of the underlying disorder (e.g. diabetes mellitus).Antilipemic agent that lowers cholesterol and triglycerides. It decreases low density lipoproteins and increases high density lipoproteins.Bezafibrate is an antilipemic agent that lowers cholesterol and triglycerides. It decreases low density lipoproteins and increases high density lipoproteins. Bezafibrate lowers elevated blood lipids (triglycerides and cholesterol). Elevated VLDL and LDL are reduced by treatment with bezafibrate, whilst HDL-levels are increased. The activity of triglyceride lipases (lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipoproteinlipase) involved in the catabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins is increased by bezafibrate. In the course of the intensified degradation of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (chylomicrons, VLDL) precursors for the formation of HDL are formed which explains an increase in HDL. Furthermore, cholesterol biosynthesis is reduced by bezafibrate, which is accompanied by a stimulation of the LDL-receptor-mediated lipoprotein catabolism. Elevated fibrinogen appears to be an important risk-factor, alongside the lipids, smoking and hypertension, in the development of atheroma. Fibrinogen plays an important role in viscosity, and therefore blood flow, and also appears to play an important role in thrombus development and lysability. Bezafibrate exerts an effect on thrombogenic factors. A significant decrease in elevated plasma fibrinogen levels can be achieved. This may lead, amongst other things, to a reduction in both blood and plasma viscosity. Inhibition of platelet aggregation has also been observed. A reduction in blood glucose concentration due to an increase in glucose tolerance has been reported in diabetic patients. In the same patients, the concentration of fasting and postprandial free fatty acids was reduced by bezafibrate.It is generally accepted that bezafibrate is likely an agonist of PPAR-alpha. However, certain other investigations have also suggested that the substance might also elicit some effects on PPAR-gamma and PPAR-delta too."
906,"Colchicine is indicated for the prophylaxis and treatment of gout flares. It is also indicated in Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) in children and adults of four years of age and older.[L8138] It is also indicated to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, coronary revascularization, and cardiovascular death in adult patients with established atherosclerotic disease or with multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease.[L47591]     Some off-label uses of colchicine include the treatment of the manifestations of Behcet's syndrome, pericarditis, and postpericardiotomy syndrome.[A183932,A183935]Colchicine is an alkaloid drug derived from a plant belonging to the Lily family, known as _Colchicum autumnale_, or ""autumn crocus.""[A183611] Its use was first approved by the FDA in 1961.[L8192] Colchicine is used in the treatment of gout flares and Familial Mediterranean fever,[L8138] and prevention of major cardiovascular events.[L47591] It has also been investigated in other inflammatory and fibrotic conditions.[A183602]Colchicine ameliorates the symptoms of gout and Familial Mediterranean fever.[A183602,L8138] It possesses anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, and cardiovascular protective effects. Colchicine was shown to exhibit anticancer properties, such as the inhibition of cancer cell migration and angiogenesis. Colchicine has a narrow therapeutic window.[A183602]The exact mechanism of action of colchicine has not been fully established; however, colchicine likely interferes with the intracellular assembly of the inflammasome complex present in neutrophils and monocytes that mediates activation of interleukin-1β, an inflammatory mediator.[A183602,A183605,L8138] Colchicine also attenuates neutrophil adhesion and recruitment, as well as superoxide production.[A183611] Clinical data demonstrate that colchicine reduces high-sensitivity C- reactive protein (hs-CRP).[L47591]    Colchicine is an anti-mitotic drug that disrupts cytoskeletal functions by inhibiting β-tubulin polymerization into microtubules. Consequently, it prevents the activation, degranulation, and migration of neutrophils. This pharmacological action is thought to be related to colchicine ameliorating gout symptoms and preventing major cardiovascular events.[L8138,L47591] Colchicine blocks microtubule growth at low concentrations and causes the depolymerization of microtubules at high concentrations.[A183602]"
907,"L7973,L33174] In addition to its use for contraceptive effects, this combination is used to treat moderate acne vulgaris and the symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder.[L7973,L7976]  The drug has approved indications for combination with estrogens for the treatment of menopause-associated symptoms, such as vasomotor symptoms and vulvovaginal atrophy. Drospirenone combined with estrogen may also may aid in the prevention of osteoporosis in women who have been post-menopausal for at least a year and are not candidates for other therapies.[L7997,L8075]   It can sometimes be found in preparations containing estrogen and folic acid for folic acid replenishment during oral contraception.[L8078]    When used for the treatment of acne vulgaris, drospirenone-containing contraceptives should only be used in women ≥14 years of age who have experienced menarche, desire oral contraception, and do not have any contraindications to oral contraceptives.[L7976] Off-label uses for this drug include the treatment of menstrual irregularities, dysmenorrhea, hirsutism, and endometriosis.[A2439,A182576]Drospirenone is a synthetic progestin commonly found in the popular oral contraceptive, Yaz in combination with [Ethinyl estradiol].[L33199,L33174]  Aside from its contraceptive effects, drospirenone is used with estrogens to control acne and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).    Drospirenone has been the subject of widespread safety concern due to the possibility of an increased risk of venous thromboembolism associated with its use.[A182543,A182552] In 2012, however, a safety statement by the FDA concluded that the increase in the risk of thromboembolism resulting from the use of drospirenone remains unclear, as studies regarding this risk are conflicting. Some studies have demonstrated a significantly increased risk and some demonstrating no risk of thromboembolic events.  In its statement, the FDA has mentioned that increased risk of venous thromboembolism with oral contraceptives such as drospirenone exists but remains lower than the risk of this condition during pregnancy and during the postpartum period, and this should be considered when assessing potential risks of hormonal contraceptive use.[L7979]Drospirenone inhibits the maturation of follicles and inhibits ovulation, preventing pregnancy.  It has antiandrogen effects, improving acne and hirsutism.[L7976] Due to its similarity to naturally occurring progesterone, drospirenone is thought to be associated with a lower incidence of progesterone contraceptive related adverse effects, such as breast tenderness and mood swings.[A2439]    **A note on venous thromboembolism risk and antimineralcorticoid effects**    As with other oral contraceptives, the risk of venous thromboembolism and cardiovascular events may be increased when drospirenone is taken. The risk is especially higher in smokers and women aged 35 and older. Women taking this drug should be advised not to smoke. In addition, drospirenone, due to its antimineralcorticoid effects, may increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Patients at high risk for hyperkalemia should not be administered this drug. Consult the official prescribing information for detailed and updated information on the cardiovascular and other risks associated with drospirenone use.[L7973,L7976,L7997]Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol in combination suppress the release of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), preventing ovulation. Other changes induced by this drug which may aid in the prevention of pregnancy include alterations in cervical mucus consistency, hindering sperm movement, and lowering the chance of embryo implantation.[L7976]    Drospirenone is an analog of the diuretic spironolactone, which exerts anti-mineralocorticoid activity, blocking aldosterone receptors, which increases sodium and water excretion.[A2439] Studies in animals have demonstrated that drospirenone administration leads to antiandrogenic activity. This activity helps to oppose the effects of naturally occurring androgens, inhibiting the binding of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to its receptor, and preventing androgen synthesis in the ovaries, helping to treat acne and hirsutism.[A2439,A182588,L7973] Drospirenone may also decrease the level of edema in sebaceous follicle during the second half of the menstrual cycle, when acne often appears.[L7973]"
908,"For the treatment and management of congestive cardiac insufficiency, arrhythmias and heart failure.A cardiac glycoside sometimes used in place of digoxin. It has a longer half-life than digoxin; toxic effects, which are similar to those of digoxin, are longer lasting. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p665)Digitoxin is a cardiac glycoside sometimes used in place of DIGOXIN. It has a longer half-life than digoxin; toxic effects, which are similar to those of digoxin, are longer lasting (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p665). It is eliminated hepatically making it useful in patients with poor or erratic kidney function, although it is now rarely used in practice. Digitoxin lacks the strength of evidence that digoxin has in the management of heart failure.Digitoxin inhibits the Na-K-ATPase membrane pump, resulting in an increase in intracellular sodium and calcium concentrations. Increased intracellular concentrations of calcium may promote activation of contractile proteins (e.g., actin, myosin). Digitoxin also acts on the electrical activity of the heart, increasing the slope of phase 4 depolarization, shortening the action potential duration, and decreasing the maximal diastolic potential."
909,"For relief of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and related rheumatic disorders.Salsalate is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent for oral administration. Salsalate's mode of action as an anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic agent may be due to inhibition of synthesis and release of prostaglandins. The usefulness of salicylic acid, the active in vivo product of salsalate, in the treatment of arthritic disorders has been established. In contrast to aspirin, salsalate causes no greater fecal gastrointestinal blood loss than placebo. Salsalate is readily soluble in the small intestine where it is partially hydrolyzed to two molecules of salicylic acid. A significant portion of the parent compound is absorbed unchanged and undergoes rapid esterase hydrolysis in the body. The parent compound has an elimination half-life of about 1 hour. Salicylic acid (the active metabolite) biotransformation is saturated at anti-inflammatory doses of salsalate. Such capacity limited biotransformation results in an increase in the half-life of salicylic acid from 3.5 to 16 or more hours.Salsalate is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent for oral administration. Salsalate's mode of action as an anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic agent may be due to inhibition of synthesis and release of prostaglandins. The usefulness of salicylic acid, the active in vivo product of salsalate, in the treatment of arthritic disorders has been established. In contrast to aspirin, salsalate causes no greater fecal gastrointestinal blood loss than placebo.The mode of anti-inflammatory action of salsalate and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is not fully defined, but appears to be primarily associated with inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. This inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis is done through the inactivation of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and COX-2, which are reponsible for catalyzing the formation of prostaglandins in the arachidonic acid pathway. Although salicylic acid (the primary metabolite of salsalate) is a weak inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro, salsalate appears to selectively inhibit prostaglandin synthesis in vivo, providing anti-inflammatory activity equivalent to aspirin and indomethacin. Unlike aspirin, salsalate does not inhibit platelet aggregation."
910,"Neostigmine is used for the symptomatic treatment of myasthenia gravis by improving muscle tone.A cholinesterase inhibitor used in the treatment of myasthenia gravis and to reverse the effects of muscle relaxants such as gallamine and tubocurarine. Neostigmine, unlike physostigmine, does not cross the blood-brain barrier.Neostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor used in the treatment of myasthenia gravis and to reverse the effects of muscle relaxants such as gallamine and tubocurarine. Neostigmine, unlike physostigmine, does not cross the blood-brain barrier. By inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, more acetylcholine is available in the synapse, therefore, more of it can bind to the fewer receptors present in myasthenia gravis and can better trigger muscular contraction.    Neostigmine is a parasympathomimetic, specifically, a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor. The drug inhibits acetylcholinesterase which is responsible for the degredation of acetylcholine. So, with acetylcholinesterase inhibited, more acetylcholine is present By interfering with the breakdown of acetylcholine, neostigmine indirectly stimulates both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors which are involved in muscle contraction.. It does not cross the blood-brain barrier."
911,"For the treatment of psychosis, particular those of schizophrenia, and manic phases of bipolar disorder.A phenothiazine with pharmacological activity similar to that of both chlorpromazine and promethazine.

It has the histamine-antagonist properties of the antihistamines together with central nervous system effects resembling those of chlorpromazine. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p604)Methotrimeprazine's antipsychotic effect is largely due to its antagonism of dopamine receptors in the brain. In addition, its binding to 5HT2 receptors may also play a role. "
912,"For the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections, genital and urinary infections like prostatitis, and skin infections.Temafloxacin is an antibiotic agent belonging to the fluoroquinolone drug class. It was first approved for use in the U.S. market in 1992, but was withdrawn shortly due to the reports of serious adverse reactions, such as allergic reactions and hemolyric anemia, resulting in three deaths.Temafloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic drug, marketed as Omniflox by Abbot Laboratories, which was withdrawn from the market in 1992 due to fatal adverse effects. Flouroquinolones such as lomefloxacin possess excellent activity against gram-negative aerobic bacteria such as E.coli and Neisseria gonorrhoea as well as gram-positive bacteria including S. pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. They also posses effective activity against shigella, salmonella, campylobacter, gonococcal organisms, and multi drug resistant pseudomonas and enterobacter.The bactericidal action of temafloxacin results from interference with the activity of the bacterial enzymes DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, which are needed for the transcription and replication of bacterial DNA. DNA gyrase appears to be the primary quinolone target for gram-negative bacteria. Topoisomerase IV appears to be the preferential target in gram-positive organisms. Interference with these two topoisomerases results in strand breakage of the bacterial chromosome, supercoiling, and resealing. As a result DNA replication and transcription is inhibited."

It possesses some androgenic properties. Danazol has been used in the treatment of endometriosis and some benign breast disorders.Danazol is a derivative of the synthetic steroid ethisterone, a modified testosterone. It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the first drug to specifically treat endometriosis, but its role as a treatment for endometriosis has been largely replaced by the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists. Danazol has antigonadotropic and anti-estrogenic activities. Danazol acts as an anterior pituitary suppressant by inhibiting the pituitary output of gonadotropins. It possesses some androgenic properties.As a gonadotropin inhibitor, danazol suppresses the pituitary-ovarian axis possibly by inhibiting the output of pituitary gonadotropins. Danazol also depresses the preovulatory surge in output of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), thereby reducing ovarian estrogen production. Danazol may also directly inhibits ovarian steroidogenesis; bind to androgen, progesterone, and glucocorticoid receptors; bind to sex-hormone-binding globulin and corticosteroid-binding globulin; and increases the metabolic clearance rate of progesterone. Another mechanism of action by which danazol may use to facilitate regression of endometriosis is by decreasing IgG, IgM, and IgA concentrations, as well as phospholipid and IgG isotope autoantibodies. In the treatment of endometriosis, as a consequence of suppression of ovarian function,  danazol causes both normal and ectopic endometrial tissues to become inactive and atrophic. This leads to anovulation and associated amenorrhea. In fibrocystic breast disease, the exact mechanism of action of danazol is unknown, but may be related to suppressed estrogenic stimulation as a result of decreased ovarian production of estrogen. A direct effect on steroid receptor sites in breast tissue is also possible. This leads to a disappearance of nodularity, relief of pain and tenderness, and possibly changes in the menstrual pattern. In terms of hereditary angioedema, danazol corrects the underlying biochemical deficiency by increasing serum concentrations of the deficient C1 esterase inhibitor, resulting in increased serum concentrations of the C4 component of the complement system.

914,"For the prevention and reversal of bronchospasm in patients 12 years of age and older with asthma and reversible bronchospasm associated with bronchitis and emphysema.Bambuterol is a long acting beta-adrenoceptor agonist used in the treatment of asthma. It is a prodrug of terbutaline.Bambuterol is a long acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonist used in the treatment of asthma. It is a prodrug of terbutaline. Bambuterol causes smooth muscle relaxation, resulting in dilation of bronchial passages.The pharmacologic effects of bambuterol are at least in part attributable to stimulation through beta-adrenergic receptors (beta 2 receptors) of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic AMP. Increased cyclic AMP levels are associated with relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells."
915,"For the treatment of nasal symptoms associated with seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older.Ciclesonide is a glucocorticoid used to treat obstructive airway diseases. It is marketed under the brand name Alvesco.Ciclesonide is a pro-drug that is enzymatically hydrolyzed to a pharmacologically active metabolite, C21-desisobutyryl-ciclesonide (des-ciclesonide or RM1) following intranasal application. Des-ciclesonide has anti-inflammatory activity with affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor that is 120 times higher than the parent compound. The precise mechanism through which ciclesonide affects allergic rhinitis symptoms is not known. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of effects on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in allergic inflammation.Glucocorticoids such as ciclesonide can inhibit leukocyte infiltration at the site of inflammation, interfere with mediators of inflammatory response, and suppress humoral immune responses. The antiinflammatory actions of glucocorticoids are thought to involve phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, lipocortins, which control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Ciclesonide reduces inflammatory reaction by limiting the capillary dilatation and permeability of the vascular structures. These compounds restrict the accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages and reduce the release of vasoactive kinins. Recent research suggests that corticosteroids may inhibit the release of arachidonic acid from phospholipids, thereby reducing the formation of prostaglandins. Ciclesonide is a glucocorticoid receptor agonist. On binding, the corticoreceptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing an increase or decrease in expression of specific target genes, including suppression of IL2 (interleukin 2) expression."
916,"Cefepime is indicated for the treatment of pneumonia caused by susceptible bacteria, and for empiric therapy for febrile neutropenic patients. Cefepime is also indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated and complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) including pyelonephritis, uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, and complicated intra-abdominal infections (used in combination with [metronidazole]) in adults caused by susceptible bacteria.[L42095,L42100]    Cefepime is also used in combination with [enmetazobactam] to treat cUTI.[L50117]Cefepime is a fourth-generation cephalosporin antibiotic developed in 1994. Cefepime is active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and has greater activity against both compared to third-generation antibiotics.[A2457,A249050] Cefepime is normally used to treat severe nosocomial pneumonia and infections caused by multi-resistant microorganisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and is also indicated for the empirical treatment of febrile neutropenia.[A249050] The popularity of its third-generation predecessors, its clinical efficacy, and the high prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria might be some of the factors leading to an increase in the use of cefepime. The activity of cefepime against Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus_ is due to its high stability toward beta-lactamases.[A249050] In general, cefepime seems to be well tolerated; however, patients treated with this antibiotic, especially those with renal impairment, may develop neurotoxicity.[A249050,L42095,L42100]Cefepime is a fourth-generation cephalosporin antibiotic.[L42095,L42100] It is active against Gram-negative bacteria such as Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Viridans group streptococci.[L42095,L42100] Compared to third-generation cephalosporins, cefepime has an extended Gram-negative coverage. Whereas other cephalosporins are degraded by plasmid- and chromosome-mediated beta-lactamases, cefepime is stable and not significantly hydrolyzed by these enzymes.[A2457,A249050] Cefepime is also a poor inducer of type 1 beta-lactamases and, therefore, a good alternative against bacteria resistant to third-generation cephalosporins.[A2457]     In animal models of infection, the time that the unbound plasma concentration of cefepime exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of infecting organisms has been shown to correlate with treatment efficacy.[L42095,L42100] It has been suggested that cefepime can cross the inflamed blood-brain barrier.[L42095,L42100] This, along with its ability to inhibit γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), could lead to the neurotoxic effects observed in some of the patients treated with cefepime.[A249045,A249050]Cefepime is a bactericidal cephalosporin with a mode of action similar to other beta-lactam antibiotics.[L42095,L42100] Cefepime disrupts bacterial cell walls by binding and inhibiting transpeptidases known as penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), which are enzymes involved in the final stages of peptidoglycan layer synthesis. This results in the lysis and death of susceptible microorganisms.[A249050] Cefepime has a broad spectrum of in vitro activity that includes both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.[L42095,L42100] Cefepime has affinity for PBP-3 and PBP-1 in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as PBP-2 in E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae.[A249050]"
917,"Cefacetrile is a broad-spectrum first generation cephalosporin antibiotic effective in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial infections.A derivative of 7-aminocephalosporanic acid.Cefacetrile is effective against many Gram-positive bacterial strains and somewhat less effective against Gram-negative species. It works by inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. It attains high serum levels and is excreted quickly via the urine.In vitro tests demonstrate that the bactericidal action of cephalosporins results from inhibition of cell wall synthesis. By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, it inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins."
918,"Indicated for the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (ABECB), acute bacterial otitis media, pharyngitis, and tonsilitis.Ceftibuten is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic that is orally-administered. It is typically used to treat acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (ABECB), acute bacterial otitis media, pharyngitis, and tonsilitis.Ceftibuten is an antibiotic with bactericidal actions. Ceftibuten exerts its bactericidal action by binding to essential target proteins of the bacterial cell wall. This binding leads to inhibition of cell-wall synthesis."
919,"Indicated for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms.Cefpodoxime is an oral third generation cephalosporin antibiotic with effectiveness against most Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. Commonly used to treat acute otitis media, pharyngitis, and sinusitis, cefpodoxime proxetil is a prodrug which is absorbed and de-esterified by the intestinal mucosa to Cefpodoxime.Cefpodoxime is shown to be effective against most Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, except Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus, and Bacteroides fragilis.Cefpodoxime is active against a wide spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Cefpodoxime is stable in the presence of beta-lactamase enzymes. As a result, many organisms resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins, due to their production of beta-lactamase, may be susceptible to cefpodoxime. Cefpodoxime is inactivated by certain extended spectrum beta-lactamases. The bactericidal activity of cefpodoxime results from its inhibition of cell wall synthesis. The active metabolite of cefpodoxime binds preferentially to penicillin binding protein 3, which inhibits production of peptidoglycan, the primary constituent of bacterial cell walls."
920,"For the treatment and prevention of thromboembolic diseases. More specifically, it is indicated for the prevention of cerebral embolism, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, thromboembolism in infarction and transient ischemic attacks. It is used for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis and myocardial infarction.Acenocoumarol is a coumarin derivative used as an anticoagulant. Coumarin derivatives inhibit the reduction of vitamin K by vitamin K reductase. This prevents carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, II, VII, IX and X, and interferes with coagulation.[A188739] Hematocrit, hemoglobin, international normalized ratio and liver panel should be monitored. Patients on acenocoumarol are prohibited from giving blood.Acenocoumarol inhibits the reduction of vitamin K by vitamin K reductase. This prevents carboxylation of certain glutamic acid residues near the N-terminals of clotting factors II, VII, IX and X, the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. Glutamic acid carboxylation is important for the interaction between these clotting factors and calcium. Without this interaction, clotting cannot occur. Both the extrinsic (via factors VII, X and II) and intrinsic (via factors IX, X and II) are affected by acenocoumarol.Acenocoumarol inhibits vitamin K reductase, resulting in depletion of the reduced form of vitamin K (vitamin KH2). As vitamin K is a cofactor for the carboxylation of glutamate residues on the N-terminal regions of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, this limits the gamma-carboxylation and subsequent activation of the vitamin K-dependent coagulant proteins. The synthesis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X and anticoagulant proteins C and S is inhibited resulting in decreased prothrombin levels and a decrease in the amount of thrombin generated and bound to fibrin. This reduces the thrombogenicity of clots."
921,"Testosterone propionate is used in veterinary practice in heifers in order to stimulate maximal growth.[L1160]Testosterone propionate is a slower-releasing anabolic steroid with a short half-life. It is a synthetic androstane steroid derivative of testosterone in the form of 17β propionate ester of testosterone.[T83] Testosterone propionate was developed initially by Watson labs, and FDA approved on February 5, 1974. Currently, this drug has been discontinued in humans, but the vet application is still available as an OTC.[L1160]The administration of testosterone propionate can induce production of proteins related to male sexual development.[L1162] Clinical trials have shown a decrease in plasma LH after the administration of testosterone propionate.[A31625]The effects of testosterone in humans and other vertebrates occur by way of two main mechanisms: by activation of the androgen receptor (directly or as DHT), and by conversion to estradiol and activation of certain estrogen receptors. Free testosterone (T) is transported into the cytoplasm of target tissue cells, where it can bind to the androgen receptor, or can be reduced to 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the cytoplasmic enzyme 5alpha-reductase. The areas of binding are called hormone response elements (HREs), and influence transcriptional activity of certain genes, producing the androgen effects."
922,"Formerly widely used as an antipyretic and analgesic in rheumatism, neuritis, and common colds. Currently used to measure total body water.Aminophenazone is a pyrazolone with analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties that carries a risk of agranulocytosis. In biomedical applications, radiolabelled (13C-labeled) aminophenazone has been used in breath tests to measure the cytochrome P-450 metabolic activity in liver function tests. The FDA suspended the use of aminophenazone due to its association with agranulocytosis, a life-threatening side effect.[A254242,L43942]Aminophenazone exhibits analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties.Aminophenazone is metabolized very slowly by normal newborn babies. In older infants, a higher amount of exhaled 13-CO2 is observed."
923,"For use as an antiarrhythmic agent.An alkaloid found in the root of Rauwolfia serpentina, among other plant sources. It is a class Ia antiarrhythmic agent that apparently acts by changing the shape and threshold of cardiac action potentials. Ajmaline produces potent sodium channel blocking effects and a very short half-life which makes it a very useful drug for acute intravenous treatments. The drug has been very popular in some countries for the treatment of atrial fibrillation in patients with the Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome and in well tolerated monomorphic ventricular tachycardias. It has also been used for many years as a drug to challenge the conduction system of the heart in cases of bundle branch block and syncope. In these cases, abnormal prolongation of the HV interval has been taken as a proof for infrahisian conduction defects tributary for permanent pacemaker implantation.Ajmaline is a class 1A antiarrhythmic agent. By interfering with the sodium channels, this drug allows for improvement in abnormal rhythms of the heartThe class I antiarrhythmic agents interfere with the sodium channel. A class IA agent lengthens the action potential (right shift) which brings about improvement in abnormal heart rhythms. This drug in particular has a high affinity for the Nav 1.5 sodium channel."
924,"Used in the treatment of congestive heart failure.Amrinone (or inamrinone) is a type 3 pyridine phosphodiesterase inhibitor. It is used in the treatment of congestive heart failure.Amrinone is a positive inotropic cardiotonic with vasodilator properties, phosphodiesterase inhibitory activity, and the ability to stimulate calcium ion influx into the cardiac cell.Amrinone is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (PDE3), resulting in increased cAMP and cGMP which leads to an increase in the calcium influx like that caused by beta-agonists resulting in increased inotropic effect."

926,"Allylestrenol was designed to be used for miscarriage prevention, prevention of premature labour and has been investigated for possible use in men for treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia.A synthetic steroid with progestational activity. It is widely marketed throughout Europe, including Russia and many other European countries, and is also available in Japan, Hong Kong, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and much of Southeast Asia, though notably not in the United States or Canada.Allylestrenol is a progestogen structurally related to progesterone that has been given in threatened and recurrent miscarriage, and to prevent premature labour. However, with the exception of proven progesterone deficiency, such use is no longer recommended. In threatened miscarriage in progesterone-deficient women a suggested dose is 5 mg three times daily by mouth for 5 to 7 days.Allylestrenol is similar in structure and function to progesterone. Progesterone shares the pharmacological actions of the progestins. Progesterone binds to the progesterone and estrogen receptors. Target cells include the female reproductive tract, the mammary gland, the hypothalamus, and the pituitary. Once bound to the receptor, progestins like Progesterone will slow the frequency of release of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus and blunt the pre-ovulatory LH (luteinizing hormone) surge. In women who have adequate endogenous estrogen, progesterone transforms a proliferative endometrium into a secretory one. Progesterone is essential for the development of decidual tissue and is necessary to increase endometrial receptivity for implantation of an embryo. Once an embryo has been implanted, progesterone acts to maintain the pregnancy. Progesterone also stimulates the growth of mammary alveolar tissue and relaxes uterine smooth muscle. It has little estrogenic and androgenic activity."
927,"Antipyrine is an analgesic often used to test effects of other drugs on liver enzymes. An analgesic and antipyretic that has been given by mouth and as ear drops. Antipyrine is often used in testing the effects of other drugs or diseases on drug-metabolizing enzymes in the liver. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p29)Antipyrine is an analgesic and antipyretic that has been given by mouth and as ear drops. Antipyrine is often used in testing the effects of other drugs or diseases on drug-metabolizing enzymes in the liver. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p29)Antipyrine is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis."
928,"Alfacalcidol is indicated in adult patients with chronic renal failure for the management of hypocalcemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, or osteodystrophy.[L33284]    Alfacalcidol is indicated in the management of nutritional and malabsorptive rickets and osteomalacia, vitamin D-dependent rickets and osteomalacia, and hypophosphataemic vitamin D resistant rickets and osteomalacia.[L33364,L33369]Alfacalcidol, or 1-alpha-hydroxycholecalciferol or 1-alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3, is a non-endogenous analogue of [vitamin D].[A234044] It plays an essential function in calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism. Alfacaldisol is activated by the enzyme 25-hydroxylase in the liver to mediate its effects in the body, or most importantly, the kidneys and bones. The pharmacological actions of alfacalcidol are prolonged than vitamin D because a negative feedback mechanism regulates the final activation step of vitamin D in the kidneys.[A175348,A175351]    Alfacalcidol is available in oral and intravenous formulations. In Canada, it is marketed as ONE-ALPHA, which manages hypocalcemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and osteodystrophy in adults with chronic renal failure.[L33284] In approving European countries, alfacalcidol is also indicated for managing nutritional and malabsorptive rickets and osteomalacia, vitamin D-dependent rickets and osteomalacia, and hypophosphataemic vitamin D resistant rickets and osteomalacia.[L33364,L33369]Alfacalcidol works to increase serum levels of calcium by stimulating intestinal calcium absorption, reabsorption of calcium from bone, and possibly the renal reabsorption of calcium. It also modestly promotes intestinal phosphorus absorption.[L33284] In patients with renal failure, alfacalcidol increased intestinal calcium and phosphorus absorption in a dose-related manner. This increase in calcium and phosphorus levels occurs within three days following drug administration: this effect was reversed within three days of drug discontinuation. In patients with chronic renal failure, serum calcium levels were elevated while parathyroid hormone and alkaline phosphatase levels returned to normal levels within five days following alfacalcidol administration.[L33369] Since alfacalcidol suppresses parathyroid hormone, a reduction in parathyroid hormone levels is achieved more rapidly in patients on intermittent intravenous therapy, with significant reductions occurring within three months of therapy. In patients receiving daily oral therapy of alfacalcidol, the time it takes alfacalcidol to normalize plasma calcium levels may be up to several months, possibly reflecting calcium being utilized for bone mineralization.[L33284] In patients with nutritional osteomalacia, alfacalcidol increased calcium absorption with six hours of oral administration and the effects peaked at 24 hours.[L33369]In conditions like chronic renal failure, renal bone disease, hypoparathyroidism, and vitamin D dependent rickets, the kidneys' capacity for 1α-hydroxylation is impaired, leading to reduced production of endogenous 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and aberrated mineral metabolism. As an active and potent analog of vitamin D, alfacalcidol works to restore the functions and activities of endogenous 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.[L33369]"
929,"For the treatment of insomnia.Glutethimide is a hypnotic and sedative. Its use has been largely superseded by other drugs.Glutethimide, like the barbiturates, is a hypnotic sedative. It was introduced in 1954 as a safer alternative to barbiturates but was soon determined to be just as likely to cause addiction and withdrawal symptoms.Glutethimide seems to be a GABA agonist which helps induce sedation. It also induces CYP 2D6. When taken with codeine, it enables the body to convert higher amounts of codeine (higher than the average 5 - 10%) to morphine. This combination of effects enhances sedation."
930,"Diamorphine, as a prescription medication in the United Kingdom, is indicated for use in the treatment of severe pain associated with surgical procedures, myocardial infarction or pain in the terminally ill and for the relief of dyspnoea in acute pulmonary edema [L4999].Diamorphine (heroin) is a narcotic analgesic that may be habit-forming. It is a controlled substance (opium derivative) listed in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21 Parts 329.1, 1308.11 (1987). Sale is forbidden in the United States by Federal statute. (Merck Index, 11th ed) Internationally, diamorphine is controlled under Schedules I and IV of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. As heroin, it is illegal to manufacture, possess, or sell in the United States and the UK. However, under the name diamorphine, heroin is a legal prescription drug in the United Kingdom.The onset of heroin's effects is dependent on the method of administration. Taken orally, heroin is totally metabolized in vivo via extensive first-pass metabolism into morphine before crossing the blood-brain barrier; so the effects are the same as orally administered morphine [L4996, L4999]. Take by injection, diamorphine's acetyl groups facilitate rapid crossing into the brain [L4996, L4999]. Once in the brain, heroin is rapidly metabolized into morphine by removal of the acetyl groups, therefore making it a prodrug for the delivery of morphine [L4996, L4999]. Subsequently, whether eliciting actions peripherally (on smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, kidney, lung, liver, or spleen tissue [L4996], for example) or on the central nervous system, it is ultimately the morphine metabolite of heroin that then binds with opioid receptors and produces the narcotic opioid effects commonly associated with the substance [L4996, L4999].When administered orally, diamorphine experiences extensive first-pass metabolism by way of deacetylation to generate the active metabolites 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) and morphine [L4996, L4999]. Alternatively, when given as an injection the acetyl groups present in the diamorphine/diacetylmorphine compound confer the substance lipophilicity that facilitates diamorphine's rapid crossing of the blood-brain-barrier [L4996, L4999]. Once in the brain, diamorphine is metabolised via deacetylation to the active 6-MAM and morphine metabolites as well [L4996, L4999]. Despite diamorphine possessing little to no opioid agonist activity itself, its rapid transit across the blood-brain-barrier elicits a far faster onset of activity in comparison to the extensive first-pass metabolism of oral administration [L4996, L4999]. Regardless, the metabolism of diamorphine to morphine makes heroin a prodrug for the delivery of morphine [L4996, L4999].    Morphine is subsequently a mu-opioid agonist. It acts on endogenous mu-opioid receptors that are spread in discrete packets throughout the brain, spinal cord and gut in almost all mammals [A2476]. Morphine, along with other opioids, are agonists to four endogenous neurotransmitters [A2476]. They are beta-endorphin, dynorphin, leu-enkephalin, and met-enkephalin [A2476]. The body responds to morphine in the brain by reducing (and sometimes stopping) production of the endogenous opioids when morphine is present [A2476]. Endorphins are regularly released in the brain and nerves, attenuating pain. Their other functions are still obscure, but are probably related to the effects produced by morphine besides analgesia (antitussin, anti-diarrheal) [A2476].    Nevertheless, morphine ultimately elicits the majority of its analgesic activity by binding to mu opioid receptors in both the central and peripheral nervous systems [L5005]. The overall effect of morphine is activation of descending inhibitory pathways of the central nervous system as well as inhibition of nociceptive afferent neurons of the peripheral nervous system, which results in an overall reduction of the nociceptive pain transmission [L5005]. "
931,"Ethylmorphine is an analgesic used for pain relief.A narcotic analgesic and antitussive. It is metabolized in the liver by ethylmorphine-N-demethylase and used as an indicator of liver function. It is not marketed in the US but is approved for use in various countries around the world. In the US it is a schedule II drug (single-entity) and schedule III drug (in combination products).Ethylmorphine is metabolized by the enzyme cytochrome P450 2D6 to morphine. Morphine is a narcotic pain management agent indicated for the relief of pain in patients who require opioid analgesics for more than a few days. Morphine interacts predominantly with the opioid mu-receptor. These mu-binding sites are discretely distributed in the human brain, with high densities in the posterior amygdala, hypothalamus, thalamus, nucleus caudatus, putamen, and certain cortical areas. They are also found on the terminal axons of primary afferents within laminae I and II (substantia gelatinosa) of the spinal cord and in the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve. In clinical settings, morphine exerts its principal pharmacological effect on the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. Its primary actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation. Morphine appears to increase the patient's tolerance for pain and to decrease discomfort, although the presence of the pain itself may still be recognized. In addition to analgesia, alterations in mood, euphoria and dysphoria, and drowsiness commonly occur. Opioids also produce respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers.Ethylmorphine is metabolized by the liver enzyme cytochrome P450 2D6 to morphine. The precise mechanism of the analgesic action of morphine is unknown. However, specific CNS opiate receptors have been identified and likely play a role in the expression of analgesic effects. Morphine first acts on the mu-opioid receptors. The mechanism of respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation.  It has been shown that morphine binds to and inhibits GABA inhibitory interneurons. These interneurons normally inhibit the descending pain inhibition pathway. So, without the inhibitory signals, pain modulation can proceed downstream."
932,"Bolasterone (INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name) (brand names Myagen, Methosarb; former developmental code name U-19763), also known as 7α,17α-dimethyltestosterone, is a 17α-alkylated androgen/anabolic steroid (AAS) which is used in veterinary medicine. It has close structural similarity to testosterone, and like methyltestosterone has a methyl group at C17α in order to increase oral bioavailability.In addition, it is also 7α-methylated, similar to its 7β-methylated isomer calusterone.The medication has a low to moderate ratio of anabolic to androgenic activity, similar to that of fluoxymesterone.Bolasterone is on the World Anti-Doping Agency's list of prohibited substances,and is therefore banned from use in most major sports."
933,"Haloxazolam (marketed in Japan under the brand name Somelin), is a drug which is a benzodiazepine derivative.It  is indicated for the treatment of insomnia. A study in cats comparing estazolam and haloxazolam found that haloxazolam only affects gamma motor neurons, whereas estazolam affects both alpha and gamma motor neurons."
934,"Used to decrease appetite.Cathine, also known as d-norpseudoephedrine and (+)-norpseudoephedrine, is a psychoactive drug with stimulant properties. It belongs to the phenethylamine and amphetamine chemical classes. In the United States, it is classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance.Closely related to ephedrine, cathinone and other amphetamines, it may contribute to the stimulant effect of Catha edulis, although another constituent, cathinone appears to show stronger activity."
935,"Camazepam has been used in placebo controlled studies for the treatment of patients suffering from anxiety and depression. Camazepam is a benzodiazepine which is a dimethyl carbamate ester of tamzepam, a metabolite of diazepam. Similarly to other drugs in its class, it has antxiolytic, anticonvulsant, hypnotic, and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. However, unlike other benzodiapeines camazepam is predominantly anxiolytic and is relatively weak as an anticonvulsant, hypnotic and skeletal muscle relaxant.    Camazepam also has less side effects, such as impaired cognition and reaction times, compared to other benzodiazepines. However, impairment of cognition and disrupted sleep patterns will occur at doses higher than 40mg of carazepam. Camazepam is also believed to increase attention, and is associated with skin disorders.      In the United States camazepam is regulated as a Schedule IV controlled substance.This binding of benzodiazepine receptors by camazepam and its active metabolites is responsible for its anticonvulsant effects. The anxiolytic properties of camazepam are also attributed to their ability to bind benzodiazepine receptors, also known as GABA receptors.  When benzodiazepines bind to GABA receptors they increase the efficiency with which the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA binds. "

937,"Etoxeridine (Carbetidine, Atenos) is a 4-phenylpiperidine derivative that is related to the clinically used opioid analgesic drug pethidine (meperidine).Etoxeridine was developed in the 1950s and investigated for use in surgical anesthesia, however it was never commercialized and is not currently used in medicine.As with other opioids which were not in clinical use during the drafting of the Controlled Substances Act, it is categorized as a Schedule I narcotic.
"
938,"Mainly used as an anti-anxiety agent. Studies have found delorazepam to be more effective in the first 4 weeks of use than antidepressants; however, after 4 weeks, antidepressants showed superior anti-anxiety effects. Anti-anxiety effects also appear to be weaker in elderly patients.     Effectiveness has also been observed in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal. Delorazapam was reported to be a manageable drug in that it did not exhibit severe side effects and did not require further therapies to control symptoms of withdrawal.Delorazepam is a benzodiazepine which, like other drugs in its class, possesses anxiolytic, skeletal muscle relaxant, hypnotic and anticonvulsant properties. It may have adverse effects such as drowsiness, and cognitive impairments such as short term memory impairment.        Delorazepam is an active metabolite of the benzodiazepine known as cloxazolam. It is a long acting benzodiazepine which makes it superior in this sense to lorazepam which is short acting. Lorazepam is also a major active metabolite of delorazepam.     In addition to be long acting, delorazepam is relatively potent, with 1 mg of delorazepam being the equivalent of 10 mg diazepam. It has been approved for marketing in Italy."
939,"Clostebol (INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name; also known as 4-chlorotestosterone) usually as the ester clostebol acetate, is a synthetic anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS). Clostebol is the 4-chloro derivative of the natural hormone testosterone. The chlorination prevents conversion to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) while also rendering the chemical incapable of conversion to estrogen.Although usually used as an ester including clostebol acetate (Macrobin, Steranabol, Alfa-Trofodermin, Megagrisevit), clostebol caproate (Macrobin-Depot), or clostebol propionate (Yonchlon), unmodified/non-esterified clostebol is also reported to be marketed, under the brand name Trofodermin-S in Mexico.Clostebol is a weak AAS with potential use as a performance enhancing drug. It is currently banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency. Chlorodehydromethyltestosterone (Oral Turinabol), combining the chemical structures of clostebol and metandienone, was widely used in the East German state-sponsored doping program."
940,"Clortermine (Voranil) was developed by Ciba in the 1960s and is an anorectic drug of the amphetamine class.It is the 2-chloro analogue of the better known appetite suppressant phentermine, and is the 2-chloro positional isomer of chlorphentermine. Clortermine produces very low rates of self-administration in animals similarly to chlorphentermine,and as a result it likely does not act on dopamine. Instead, it may act as a serotonin and/or norepinephrine releasing agent."
941,An opioid analgesic structurally related to methadone and used in the treatment of severe pain.
942,Chlorhexadol is a sedative and hypnotic which is regulated in the United States as a Schedule III controlled substance. It is a derivative of chloral hydrate.Chloral hydrate has sedative/hypnotic activity which has been shown to extend the sleep of normal made adults via a dose-response relationship.
943,"Boldenone is an anabolic steroid developed for veterinary use, mostly for treatment of horses. It is not indicated for use in humans in the US and is only available through veterinary clinics.Boldenone has primarily anabolic activity with low androgenic potency.  The drug is commonly used in doping within bodybuilding, even though this use is illegal. If intended to assist in bodybuilding, the drug is taken as part of a steroid stack of other anabolic steroids, usually with a potent androgen like testosterone as the 'base' of the stack. Boldenone is an androgen that differs from 17b-testosterone (17b-T) by only one double bond at the 1-position, and the removal of the methyl group protecting the 17-OH group allows it to be orally active.Boldenone is a steroid hormone which has androgenic activity. Androgens bind to the androgen receptor, which regulates gene transcription. "
944,"For short-term treatment of severe insomnias, that are not responsive to other hypnotics.Flunitrazepam is a benzodiazepine with pharmacologic actions similar to those of diazepam that can cause anterograde amnesia. Some reports indicate that it is used as a date rape drug and suggest that it may precipitate violent behavior. The United States Government has banned the importation of this drug.Flunitrazepam is a powerful hypnotic drug that is a benzodiazepine derivative. It has powerful hypnotic, sedative, anxiolytic, and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. The drug is sometimes used as a date rape drug. In the United States, the drug has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for medical use, and is considered to be an illegal drug. It has however been approved in the United Kingdom and other countries.Benzodiazepines bind nonspecifically to benzodiazepine receptors BNZ1, which mediates sleep, and BNZ2, which affects affects muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, motor coordination, and memory. As benzodiazepine receptors are thought to be coupled to gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptors, this enhances the effects of GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA receptor. Binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA to the site opens the chloride channel, resulting in a hyperpolarized cell membrane that prevents further excitation of the cell."
945,"Ethyl loflazepate(marketed under the brand names Meilax, Ronlax and Victan) is a drug which is a benzodiazepine derivative. It possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. In animal studies it was found to have low toxicity, although in rats evidence of pulmonary phospholipidosis occurred with pulmonary foam cells developing with long-term use of very high doses. Its elimination half-life is 51–103 hours. Its mechanism of action is similar to other benzodiazepines. Ethyl loflazepate also produces an active metabolite which is stronger than the parent compound. Ethyl loflazepate was designed to be a prodrug for descarboxyloflazepate, its active metabolite. It is the active metabolite which is responsible for most of the pharmacological effects rather than ethyl loflazepate.The main metabolites of ethyl loflazepate are descarbethoxyloflazepate, loflazepate and 3-hydroxydescarbethoxyloflazepate.Accumulation of the active metabolites of ethyl loflazepate are not affected by those with kidney failure or impairment.The symptoms of an overdose of ethyl loflazepate include sleepiness, agitation and ataxia. Hypotonia may also occur in severe cases. These symptoms occur much more frequently and severely in children.Death from therapeutic maintenance doses of ethyl loflazepate taken for 2 – 3 weeks has been reported in 3 elderly patients. The cause of death was asphyxia due to benzodiazepine toxicity.High doses of the antidepressant fluvoxamine may potentiate the adverse effects of ethyl loflazepate."
946,"Developed in the 1960's for use as an antidepressant before market withdrawal in 1962.   In the 1960's, alpha-ethyltryptamine (αET), a non hydrazine reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor, was developed in the United States by the Upjohn chemical company for use as an antidepressant. αET was an FDA approved antidepressant under the name Monase. However, in 1962, after the discovery of an unacceptable incidence of agranulocytosis, the development of Monase was halted and the drug was withdrawn from potential market use.     In 1993, the US Drug Enforcement Administration added αET to Schedule I of its Schedules of Controlled Substances, after an increasing incidence of its use as a recreational drug in the 1980's. Currently, αET is an illegal substance; however, it's activity is still under scientific investigation.     αET is a stimulant and hallucinogen, but it is less stimulating and hallucinogenic than alpha-methyltryptamine, a closely related compound. Instead, the effects of αET, a tryptamine derivative, more closely resemble the amphetamine derived drug 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA). Similarly to MDMA, αET has been shown to release serotonin pre-synaptically, as well as lesser amounts of norepinephrine and dopamine. Like MDMA, increases in locomotor activity and mood elevation can be seen post administration.αET is a stimulant and psychedelic with MDMA like physiological effects. Like MDMA, increases in locomotor activity and mood elevation can be seen post administration. The mechanism of action responsible for its antidepressant activity  was believed to lie in its ability to inhibit monoamine oxidase, while its stimulant activity on the central nervous system appeared to result from its structural similarity to indole-based psychedelics. Research discovered αET to be both a monoamine oxidase inhibitor and a potent monoamine releasing agent capable of serotonergic neurotoxicity. The ability to release serotonin was linked to αET's MDMA like properties. αET has been shown to release serotonin pre-synaptically, as well as lesser amounts of norepinephrine and dopamine. "
947,"Drotebanol (Oxymethebanol) is a morphinan derivative that acts as an opioid agonist. It was invented by Sankyo Company in Japan during the 1970s. It is synthesised from thebaine.Drotebanol has powerful antitussive (cough suppressant) effects, and is around 10x more potent than codeine in producing this effect. It also has analgesic effects several times stronger than codeine, but weaker than morphine. In animal studies it was found to be moderately addictive and produced limited physical dependence, but not as severe as that seen with morphine or pethidine.It was previously marketed for human use under the brand name Metebanyl, although it is now no longer used in medicine.It is currently a Schedule I Narcotic controlled substance in the United States with a DEA ACSCN of 9335 and an annual aggregate manufacturing quota of zero."
948,"Fenproporex is used as an appetite suppressant, and anti-obesity agent; however, due to substance abuse potential, it is an illicit substance in many countries. In some countries, such as Brazil, it is still prescribed -- often in the form of diet pills (ie. Brazilian Diet Pills) . In the United States the sale of such diet pills has been banned due to concerns over side effects, and the risk of potentially fatal overdose.  However, internet sales and illicit markets has lead to international availability. It has been found by primary care physicians that Brazilian immigrant women utilized imported diet pills at particularly high rates, and sometimes suffered from side effects requiring hospitalization or experienced a loss of employment. Fenproporex is an orally active stimulant drug, which was developed in the 1960s. It is used as an appetite suppressant and a treatment for obesity. It is listed as an illicit substance in many countries due to addiction issues and listed as a prohibited substance by the World Anti-Doping Agency. Structurally, fenproporex (N-2-cyanoethylamphetamine) falls within the phenylethamine and amphetamine chemical class of drugs. The N-2-cyanoethyl substituent was once believed to be resistant to cleavage, because fenproporex -- once recommended as an obesity treatment for patients with cardiovascular disease -- was originally claimed to lack stimulant properties. Contrary to the claim, research has demonstrated easy in vivo cleavage of the N-2-cyanothyl substituent to yield amphetamine as a metabolite.However, in clinical practice, central nervous system stimulative effects are less notorious than with some other agents such as diethylpropion and mazindol. In the United States fenproporex was never approved by the FDA for clinical use due to a lack of efficacy and safety data, and is listed as a drug in Schedule IV of the Controlled Substances Act. In 2006 and 2009, the FDA issued warnings that it had been detected in diet pills sold online, and imported from foreign manufacturers.Despite being banned in the United States, fenproporex has been described as the second most commonly consumed appetite suppressant worldwide, [6] with fenproporex containing anorectics still being commonly prescribed in South America. Little is known about the specific hazards of amphetamine based diet pills, however case reports have noted side effects such as chest pain, palpitations, headaches, and insomnia. In addition, placebo controlled studies have shown that participants using fenproporex experience more joint pain, sweating, blurred vision and tremor.Fenproporex was first claimed to not exert a stimulant effect on the body, however research into its metabolism has shown that it is converted into a considerable amount of amphetamine in the body, which leads to stimulant effects. [9]Fenproporex is an amphetamine based anorectic which is rapidly metabolized into amphetamine in the body. Both acute and chronic fenproporex administration has been shown to increase brain energy metabolism in young rats, by increasing the activity of citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase and complexes I,II, III, and IV. Amphetamine based drugs are also known to reduce food intake. They are addictive substances due to their ability to increase dopamine release, however their anorectic effects are believed to be a result of noradrenergic neurotransmission. Activation of the alpha 1 and beta 2 adrenoceptors has been shown to decrease food intake, and drugs which release norepinephrine or block norepinephrine reuptake can activate these receptors. The alpha 1 and beta 2 adrenoceptors are noted to be clinically important receptors in weight regulation. "
949,"Dihydrocodeine is used for the treatment of moderate to severe pain, including post-operative and dental pain [2]. It  can also be used to treat chronic pain [1], breathlessness and coughing.     In heroin addicts, dihydrocodeine has been used as a substitute drug, in doses up to 2500mg/day to treat addiction.Dihydrocodeine is an opioid analgesic used as an alternative or adjunct to codeine to treat moderate to severe pain, severe dyspnea, and cough.     It is semi-synthetic, and was developed in Germany in 1908 during an international search to find a more effective antitussive agent to help reduce the spread of airborne infectious diseases such as tuburculosis. It was marketed in 1911.Possible opioid related side effects include, but are not limited to, drowsiness, nausea, headache, dry mouth, constipation, difficulty passing urine, and mild euphoria. Dihydrocodeine is metabolized to dihydromorphine -- a highly active metabolite with a high affinity for mu opioid receptors. [3]"
950,"Used primarily as an anti-anxiety agent. Typically used short term, and may be given as a single dose of up to 100mcg/kg to reduce anxiety and tension experienced prior to surgery. Cloxazolam is a benzodiazepine with anxiolytic, sedative/hypnotic, muscle relaxant, and antiepileptic effects. It is marketed in the Argentina, Australia, Portugal, Belgium, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Germany, Taiwan and Japan -- mainly for anti-anxiety. The usual dose of cloxazolam in adults is 3-12mg/day for anti-anxiety. Although less commonly noted, it has also been reported as clinically effective in the treatment of depression, schizophrenia, and neurosis. As well, it has also been studied in Japan in doses of 15-30mg/day as an adjunct in the treatment of intractable epilepsy, for which it has demonstrated effectiveness.Studies have shown a superiority of 4mg/day of cloxazepam to 12mg/day of bromazepam in terms of anxiety, depressed mood, and sleep; an insignificant difference in terms of sedative effect; and less muscle relaxant effects. Cloxazolam, administered as a single oral dose of 3mg, when compared to a single 5 mg dose of diazepam in one study, showed similar subjective measures; however, there cloxazolam caused more fatigue, and less mood improvement. Cloxazolam also induced a significant increase in heart rate in the control group of this study. [3]Cloxazolam is a long acting benzodiazepine. It acts as a prodrug, with pharmacologically active metabolites, which bind to to the GABAa receptor, which other benzodiazepines bind to, to illicit a physiological response.  "
951,"For the short-term treatment of insomnia, short-term treatment of anxiety or panic attacks, if a benzodiazepine is required, and the alleviation of the symptoms of alcohol- and opiate-withdrawal.One of the benzodiazepines that is used in the treatment of anxiety disorders. It is a Schedule IV drug in the U.S. and Canada and under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. It is a intermediate-acting benzodiazepine.Bromazepam is a lipophilic, long-acting benzodiazepine and with sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. It does not possess any antidepressant qualities. Bromazepam, like other benzodiazepines, presents a risk of abuse, misuse, and dependence. According to many psychiatric experts, Bromazepam has a greater abuse potential than other benzodiazepines because of fast resorption and rapid onset of action.Bromazepam binds to the GABA-A receptor producing a conformational change and potentiating its inhibitory effects. Other neurotransmitters are not influenced."
952,"For the treatment of anxiety disorders.Clotiazepam is a thienodiazepine, not approved for sale in the U.S. or Canada, but has been approved in the U.K. It is a schedule IV drug in Canada.Clotiazepam is a thienodiazepine possessing anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. It increases the stage 2 non-rapid eye movement sleep.Clotiazepam acts at the benzodiazepine receptors (BZD). This agonizes the action of GABA, increasing the frequency of opening of the channel chlorinates and penetration of the ions chlorinates through the ionophore. Increase in membrane polarization decreases the probability of discharge of neurons."
953,"Mainly used as a hypnotic in the treatment of insomnia; however, it is only effective as a hypnotic for short-term use. May be used as a routine sedative preoperatively to decrease anxiety and cause sedation and/or sleep with respiration depression or cough reflex. A hypnotic and sedative used in the treatment of insomnia. The safety margin is too narrow for chloral hydrate to be used as a general anesthetic in humans, but it is commonly used for that purpose in animal experiments. It is no longer considered useful as an anti-anxiety medication."
954,"Used for the short-term treatment of anxiety disorders.Fludiazepam is a drug which is a benzodiazepine derivative. It possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. It is a scheduled drug in the U.S., but is approved for use in Japan.Fludiazepam is a benzodiazepine derivative. It possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. Fludiazepam accumulates primarily in the cortex and thalamus. Fludiazepam has similar action to diazepam, but binds with four times more affinity to benzodiazepine receptors than diazepam. "
955,"Dextroamphetamine is indicated for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).[Label]Dextroamphetamine is the dextrorotatory enantiomer of amphetamine[A2505]. Dextroamphetamine was approved by the FDA in 2001 for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder[L6010,Label].Dextroamphetamine is a noncatecholamine, sympathomimetic amine that acts as a CNS stimulant.[Label] Dextroamphetamine raises systolic and diastolic blood pressure, acts as a weak bronchodilator, and also acts as a respiratory stimulant.[Label] The general mechanism of action of dextroamphetamine has not been well established.[Label]The exact mechanism of amphetamines as a class is not known. Dextroamphetamine acts by preventing reuptake, increasing release, and stimulating reverse-transport of dopamine in synaptic clefts in the striatum.[A177253] Newer evidence shows amphetamines may also alter the number of dopamine transporters in synaptic clefts.[A177220]"
956,"Used in the management of exogenous obesity as a short term adjunct (a few weeks) in a regimen of weight reduction based on caloric restriction.Phendimetrazine is a weight loss medication. Phendimetrazine is chemically related to amphetamines and is a Schedule III drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances and in the US since 1970.Phendimetrazine is a phenylalkylamine sympathomimetic amine with pharmacological activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, the amphetamines. Actions include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance has been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as ''anorectics or anorexigenics."" It has not been established, however, that the action of such drugs in treating obesity is primarily one of appetite suppression. Other central nervous system actions or metabolic effects, may be involved.Phendimetrazine may act in a similar way to amphetamines in that it activates the alpha-adrenergic system to induce an appetite suppressive and metabolic increase effect. The drug also acts as a norepinephrine-dopamine releasing agent (NDRA). It can bind to and reverse the NET."
957,"A sulfanilamide that is used as an antibacterial agent. It can be used to treat bronchitis, prostatitis and urinary tract infections.A sulfanilamide that is used as an antibacterial agent.Sulfonamides act as competitive inhibitors of the enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase (DHPS), an enzyme involved in folate synthesis in bacteria.Sulfamerazine is a sulfonamide drug that inhibits bacterial synthesis of dihydrofolic acid by competing with para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) for binding to dihydropteroate synthetase (dihydrofolate synthetase). Sulfamerazine is bacteriostatic in nature. Inhibition of dihydrofolic acid synthesis decreases the synthesis of bacterial nucleotides and DNA. "
958,"May be used to treat primary, secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism. May also be used to suppress thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion in patients with simple (nontoxic) goiter, subacute or chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis multinodular goiter, and in the management of thyroid cancer.May also be used for differential diagnosis of suspected mild hyperthyroidism or thyroid gland autonomy.Liotrix is a synthetically derived thyroid hormone replacement preparation. It consists of levothyroxine sodium (thyroxine, T4) and liothyronine sodium (triiodothyronine, T3) in a 4 to 1 ratio by weight. Liotrix was developed when it was believed that serum levels of both T4 and T3 were maintained by direct thyroidal secretion. It is now known that the thyroid gland secretes approximately ten times more T4 than T3 and that 80% of serum T3 is derived from deiodination of T4 in peripheral tissues. Administration of levothyroxine alone is sufficient for maintaining serum T4 and T3 levels in most patients and combination hormone replacement therapy generally offers no therapeutic advantage. In fact, administration of T3 may result in supratherapeutic levels of T3.Thyroid hormone drugs are natural or synthetic preparations containing T4 or T3 or both. T4 and T3 are produced in the human thyroid gland by the iodination and coupling of the amino acid tyrosine. Liotrix is a synthetic preparation of T4 and T3 in a 4:1 weight-based ratio. These hormones enhance oxygen consumption by most tissues of the body and increase the basal metabolic rate and the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins. Thus, they exert a profound influence on every organ system in the body and are of particular importance in the development of the central nervous system.The hormones, T4 and T3, are tyrosine-based hormones produced by the thyroid gland. Iodine is an important component in their synthesis. The major secreted form of thyroid hormone is T4. T4 is converted T3, the more active thyroid hormone, by deiodinases in peripheral tissues. T3 acts in the body to increase basal metabolic rate, alter protein synthesis and increase the body's sensitivity to catecholamines (such as adrenaline). Thyroid hormones are essential for proper development and differentiation of all cells of the human body. T4 and T3 regulate protein, fat and carbohydrate metabolism to varying extents. The most pronounced effect of the hormones is in altering how human cells use energetic compounds. The thyroid hormone derivatives bind to the thyroid hormone receptors initially to initiate their downstream effects. "
959,"Ursodeoxycholic acid is indicated for the treatment of patients with primary biliary cholangitis.[L44627]     It is used for the short-term treatment of radiolucent, noncalcified gallbladder stones in patients selected for elective cholecystectomy. It is also used to prevent gallstone formation in obese patients experiencing rapid weight loss.[L44793]Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), also known as ursodiol, is a naturally-occurring bile acid that constitutes a minor fraction of the human bile acid pool.[A256272,A256277] UDCA has been used to treat liver disease for decades: its first use in traditional medicine dates back more than a hundred years.[A256267,A256463] UDCA was first characterized in the bile of the Chinese black bear and is formed by 7b-epimerization of [chenodeoxycholic acid], which is a primary bile acid.[A256272] Due to its hydrophilicity, UDCA is less toxic than [cholic acid] or [chenodeoxycholic acid].[A256272]     UDCA was first approved by the FDA in 1987 for dissolution of gallstones and for primary biliary cirrhosis in 1996.[A256272] UDCA works by replacing the hydrophobic or more toxic bile acids from the bile acid pool.[A256272]Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is a secondary bile acid with cytoprotectant, immunomodulating, and choleretic effects. It reduces the cholesterol fraction of biliary lipids.[A256267]    UDCA inhibits the absorption of cholesterol in the intestine and the secretion of cholesterol into bile, decreasing biliary cholesterol saturation.[A256267] UDCA increases bile acid flow and promotes the secretion of bile acids.[A256267,A256277,A256463]Endogenous hydrophobic bile acids such as deoxycholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid can exert hepatotoxic effects. Ursodeoxycholic acid is a hydrophilic bile acid that mediates its biological effects via several mechanisms. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) protects hepatocytes and cholangiocytes from bile acid-induced damage, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction.[A256267] UDCA was shown to reserve hepatocyte cell structures and stimulate anti-apoptotic pathways.[A256267,A256272,A256458,A256463] It was also shown to prevent the production of ROS by Kupffer cells and resident macrophages in the liver, thus attenuating oxidative stress in the liver.[A256267]     UDCA can also change the hydrophobicity index of the bile acid pool: following oral administration, UDCA forms a major fraction of the human bile acid pool and competitively displaces the hydrophobic or more toxic bile acids.[A256272,A256267] It increases the absorption of hydrophilic bile acids.[A256267] There are several proposed mechanisms of choleretic actions of UDCA: UDCA increases intracellular calcium levels, stimulating transport proteins and vesicular exocytosis in cholestatic hepatocytes.[A256267] UDCA may also upregulate the expression of membrane transport proteins like the chloride-bicarbonate anion exchanger (AE2),[A256267,A256458] which is involved in biliary secretion and is often observed to be defective in primary biliary cholangitis.[A256448] In rats, UDCA reduced hepatic expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens, suggesting immunomodulating effects.[A256267] UDCA acts as a partial agonist at the bile acid receptor, also known as the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), and has negligible effects on cholesterol and lipid synthesis.[A256272]"
960,"For the treatment of anxiety disorders.Prazepam is a benzodiazepine that is used in the treatment of anxiety disorders. It is a schedule IV drug in the U.S.Prazepam is a benzodiazepine derivative with anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant activity. Benzodiazepines may be habit-forming (causing mental or physical dependence), especially when taken for a long time or in high doses.Prazepam is believed to stimulate GABA receptors in the ascending reticular activating system. Since GABA is inhibitory, receptor stimulation increases inhibition and blocks both cortical and limbic arousal following stimulation of the brain stem reticular formation."
961,"Quazepam is indicated for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulty falling asleep, frequent nocturnal awakenings, and/or early morning awakenings.[L44913]Quazepam is a trifluoroethyl benzodiazepine derivative. It was first approved in the US in 1985 and is used as a hypnotic for the treatment of insomnia.[L44913]    It appears to be unique amongst other benzodiazepine derivatives in its relatively high affinity for sleep-promoting α1 subunit-containing GABAA receptors and low affinity for other receptors.[A256858]Benzodiazepines, including quazepam, exert their sedative and anxiolytic effects by potentiating the effects of endogenous GABA, the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system.[A34430]Like other benzodiazepines, quazepam likely exerts its effects by potentiating the effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on GABA(A) receptors, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the mammalian brain.[A198957] GABA(A) receptors are a component of GABA-gated ionotropic chloride channels that produce inhibitory postsynaptic potentials - following activation by GABA, the channel undergoes a conformational change that allows the passage of chloride ions through the channel. The inhibitory potentials produced by GABA neurotransmission play an integral role in the suppression and control of epileptiform nerve firing such as that seen in epilepsy, which makes the GABA system a desirable target in the treatment of epilepsy.    Benzodiazepines are positive allosteric modulators of GABA(A) function. They bind to the interface between alpha (α) and gamma (γ) subunits on the receptor, commonly referred to as the benzodiazepine binding site, and modulate the receptor such that its inhibitory response to GABA binding is dramatically increased.[A198957]"
962,"Everolimus is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women with advanced hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer (advanced HR+ BC) in combination with exemestane, after failure of treatment with letrozole or anastrozole.  Indicated for the treatment of adult patients with progressive neuroendocrine tumors of pancreatic origin (PNET) with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic disease.  Indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after failure of treatment with sunitinib or sorafenib.  Indicated for the treatment of adult patients with renal angiomyolipoma and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), not requiring immediate surgery.  Indicated in pediatric and adult patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) for the treatment of subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) that requires therapeutic intervention but cannot be curatively resected.Everolimus is a derivative of Rapamycin (sirolimus), and works similarly to Rapamycin as an mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor. It is currently used as an immunosuppressant to prevent rejection of organ transplants. In a similar fashion to other mTOR inhibitors Everolimus' effect is solely on the mTORC1 protein and not on the mTORC2 protein.Everolimus is a mTOR inhibitor that binds with high affinity to the FK506 binding protein-12 (FKBP-12), thereby forming a drug complex that inhibits the activation of mTOR. This inhibition reduces the activity of effectors downstream, which leads to a blockage in the progression of cells from G1 into S phase, and subsequently inducing cell growth arrest and apoptosis. Everolimus also inhibits the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor, leading to a decrease in the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor. The result of everolimus inhibition of mTOR is a reduction in cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and glucose uptake."

965,"Used to treat short-term sleeping problems (insomnia), such as difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings during the night, and early-morning awakening.A benzodiazepine derivative used as an anticonvulsant and hypnotic.Nitrazepam is a type of benzodiazepine drug. It is a powerful hypnotic drug which possesses strong sedative, anxiolytic, amnestic, anticonvulsant, and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. Nitrazepam shortens the time required to fall asleep and lengthens the duration of sleep. It is also useful for the management of myoclonic seizures.Nitrazepam belongs to a group of medicines called benzodiazepines. This drug affects central benzodiazepine receptors, which are associated with inhibitory GABA (gamma amino butyric acid)receptors, leading to enhanced GABA binding activity. GABA is a major neurotransmitter in the brain, which causes somnolence, relaxation of muscles, a decrease in anxiety and general central nervous system depression. Nitrazepam has anticonvulsant properties that may be attributed to its ability to bind to voltage-dependent sodium channels. Sustained repetitive firing seems to be limited by benzodiazepines effect of slowing recovery of sodium channels from inactivation."
966,"Used to lower LDL and HDL cholesterol.A drug used to lower LDL and HDL cholesterol yet has little effect on serum-triglyceride or VLDL cholesterol. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p993).Probucol lowers cholesterol levels by increasing LDL (low-density lipoprotein) breakdown. Additionally, probucol may inhibit cholesterol synthesis and delay cholesterol absorption. Probucol is a powerful antioxidant drug normally used to prevent vascular disease caused by the free radicals in the body.Probucol lowers serum cholesterol by increasing the fractional rate of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) catabolism in the final metabolic pathway for cholesterol elimination from the body. This drug may also act to inhibit the initial stages of cholesterol synthesis and act to inhibit the absorption of cholesterol from the diet. Recent information suggests that probucol may inhibit the oxidation and tissue deposition of LDL cholesterol, thereby inhibiting atherogenesis. It appears to inhibits ABCA1-mediated cellular lipid efflux."
967,"Ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of the enzymes responsible for lopinavir metabolism, and its co-administration ""boosts"" lopinavir exposure and improves antiviral activity.[L11163] Like many other protease inhibitors (e.g. [saquinavir], [nelfinavir]), lopinavir is a peptidomimetic molecule - it contains a hydroxyethylene scaffold that mimics the peptide linkage typically targeted by the HIV-1 protease enzyme but which itself cannot be cleaved, thus preventing the activity of the HIV-1 protease.[L11163] It has a moderate duration of action necessitating once or twice daily dosing.[L11163] Lopinavir, like other protease inhibitors, has a propensity for participating in drug interactions - use caution when administering lopinavir to patients maintained on other pharmaceutical agents as pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions are common. Fatal hepatotoxicity and pancreatitis have been noted in patients undergoing therapy with lopinavir and patients with an increased baseline risk of these events should be monitored closely throughout therapy.[L11163]The HIV lifecycle is comprised of 3 distinct stages: assembly, involving creation and packaging of essential viral components; budding, wherein the viral particle crosses the host cell plasma membrane and forms a lipid envelope; and maturation, wherein the viral particle alters its structure and becomes infectious.[A191712] At the center of this lifecycle is the Gag polyprotein which, along with the products of its proteolysis, coordinate these stages and function as the major structural proteins of the virus. The HIV-1 protease enzyme, a dimeric aspartic protease, is the enzyme responsible for cleaving the Gag polyprotein and thus plays a critical role in many aspects of the HIV viral lifecycle.[A191712]    Lopinavir is an inhibitor of the HIV-1 protease enzyme.[L11163] Its design is based on the ""peptidomimetic"" principle, wherein the molecule contains a hydroxyethylene scaffold which mimics the normal peptide linkage (cleaved by HIV protease) but which itself cannot be cleaved.[A191757] By preventing HIV-1 protease activity, and thus the proteolysis of the Gag polyprotein, lopinavir results in the production of immature, non-infectious viral particles."

969,"As with any other antibiotic, tazobactam should only be used for infections that are either proven or strongly suspected to be susceptible to the tazobactam containing drug.    **Tazobactam-piperacillin**    When combined with piperacillin, it is used to treat a variety of infections, including those caused by aerobic and facultative gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, in addition to gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes. Some examples of infections treated with piperacillin-tazobactam include cellulitis, diabetic foot infections, appendicitis, and postpartum endometritis infections.[L4417] Certain gram-negative bacilli infections with beta-lactamase producing organisms cannot be treated with piperacillin-tazobactam, due to a gene mutation conferring antibiotic resistance.[A179266]    **Tazobactam-ceftolozane**    Tazobactam is used in combination with [ceftolozane] for the treatment of infections caused by designated susceptible microorganisms in adult and pediatric patients:[L41618]    - Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections (cIAI), used in combination with [metronidazole]  - Complicated Urinary Tract Infections (cUTI), including pyelonephritis  - Hospital-acquired Bacterial Pneumonia and Ventilator-associated Bacterial Pneumonia (HABP/VABP)Tazobactam is an antibiotic of the beta-lactamase inhibitor class that prevents the breakdown of other antibiotics by beta-lactamase enzyme producing organisms. It is combined with [Piperacillin] and [Ceftolozane] for the treatment of a variety of bacterial infections.    Piperacillin-tazobactam was initially approved by the FDA in 1994, and ceftolozane-tazobactam was approved by the FDA in 2014[FDA label], providing wider antibacterial coverage for gram-negative infections. In June 2019, ceftolozane-tazobactam was approved by the FDA for treating hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia, which are significant causes of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients.[L6673]Tazobactam inhibits the action of bacterial beta-lactamase producing organisms, which are normally resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. This augments the effects of antibiotics which would otherwise not be effective in treating certain infections.  These antibiotics contain a beta-lactam ring in their chemical structure, which is destroyed by beta-lactam resistant organisms.[L41618,L4417]Tazobactam broadens the spectrum of piperacillin[L4417] and ceftolozane[L41618] by making them effective against organisms that express beta-lactamase and would normally degrade them. This occurs through the irreversible inhibition of beta-lactamase enzymes. In addition, tazobactam may bind covalently to plasmid-mediated and chromosome-mediated beta-lactamase enzymes. Tazobactam is predominantly effective against the OHIO-1, SHV-1, and TEM groups of beta-lactamases, but may also inhibit other beta-lactamases.[A179386,A179389,A179395]    Tazobactam shows little antibacterial activity by itself, and for this reason, is generally not administered alone.[L41618]  "

971,"For the treatment of chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions (transfusional hemosiderosis) in patients 2 years of age and older.Deferasirox is an iron chelator and the first oral medication FDA approved for chronic iron overload in patients receiving long term blood transfusions.Deferasirox is an orally active chelator that is selective for iron (as Fe3+). It is a tridentate ligand that binds iron with high affinity in a 2:1 ratio. Although deferasirox has very low affinity for zinc and copper there are variable decreases in the serum concentration of these trace metals after the administration of deferasirox. The clinical significance of these decreases is uncertain.Two molecules of deferasirox are capable of binding to 1 atom of iron. Deferasirox works in treating iron toxicity by binding trivalent (ferric) iron (for which it has a strong affinity), forming a stable complex which is eliminated via the kidneys."

As the L-valyl ester of ganciclovir, it is actually a prodrug for ganciclovir. After oral administration, it is rapidly converted to ganciclovir by intestinal and hepatic esterases. After this, it (being an analogue of guanosine) gets incorporated into DNA and thus cannot be properly read by DNA polymerase. This results in the termination of the elongation of viral DNA.Valganciclovir is a prodrug of ganciclovir that exists as a mixture of two diastereomers. After administration, these diastereomers are rapidly converted to ganciclovir by hepatic and intestinal esterases. In cytomegalovirus (CMV)-infected cells, ganciclovir is initially phosphorylated to the monophosphate form by viral protein kinase, then it is further phosphorylated via cellular kinases to produce the triphosphate form. This triphosphate form is slowly metabolized intracellularly. The phosphorylation is dependent upon the viral kinase and occurs preferentially in virus-infected cells. The virustatic activity of ganciclovir is due to the inhibition of viral DNA synthesis by ganciclovir triphosphate. Ganciclovir triphosphate is incorporated into the DNA strand replacing many of the adenosine bases. This results in the prevention of DNA synthesis, as phosphodiester bridges can longer to be built, destabilizing the strand. Ganciclovir inhibits viral DNA polymerases more effectively than it does cellular polymerase, and chain elongation resumes when ganciclovir is removed."

It has been shown that hydroxychloroquine accumulates in the lysosomes of the malaria parasite, raising the pH of the vacuole.[A183074] This activity interferes with the parasite's ability to proteolyse hemoglobin, preventing the normal growth and replication of the parasite.[A183074] Hydroxychloroquine can also interfere with the action of parasitic heme polymerase, an enzyme that uses ferriprotoporphyrin IX (FP) released from hemoglobin as a substrate to form beta-hematin. By reducing the activity of heme polymerase without inhibiting the release of FP, hydroxychloroquine leads to the accumulation of FP in a toxic form.[A183080]    Hydroxychloroquine accumulation in human organelles also raise their pH, which inhibits antigen processing, prevents the alpha and beta chains of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II from dimerizing, inhibits antigen presentation of the cell, and reduces the inflammatory response.[A183074] Elevated pH in the vesicles may alter the recycling of MHC complexes so that only the high affinity complexes are presented on the cell surface.[A183074] Self peptides bind to MHC complexes with low affinity and so they will be less likely to be presented to autoimmune T cells.[A183074] Hydroxychloroquine also reduces the release of cytokines like interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor, possibly through inhibition of Toll-like receptors.[A183074,A198852]    The raised pH in endosomes, prevent virus particles (such as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) from utilizing their activity for fusion and entry into the cell.[A191625]    Hydroxychloroquine inhibits terminal glycosylation of ACE2, the receptor that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 target for cell entry.[A191628,A191625] ACE2 that is not in the glycosylated state may less efficiently interact with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, further inhibiting viral entry.[A191625]"
974,"For the rapid relief of angina pectoris.Amyl Nitrite is an antihypertensive medicine. Amyl nitrite is employed medically to treat heart diseases such as angina and to treat cyanide poisoning. Its use as a prescription medicine comes from its ability to lower blood pressure. As an inhalant, it also has psychoactive effect which has led to illegal drug use.Amyl nitrite, in common with other alkyl nitrites, is a potent vasodilator. It expands blood vessels, resulting in lowering of the blood pressure. Alkyl nitrite functions as a source of nitric oxide, which signals for relaxation of the involuntary muscles. Adverse effects are related to this pharmacological activity and include hypotension, headache, flushing of the face, tachycardia, dizziness, and relaxation of involuntary muscles, especially the blood vessel walls and the anal sphincter.Amyl nitrite's antianginal action is thought to be the result of a reduction in systemic and pulmonary arterial pressure (afterload) and decreased cardiac output because of peripheral vasodilation, rather than coronary artery dilation. Amyl nitrite is a source of nitric oxide, which accounts for the mechanism described above. As an antidote (to cyanide poisoning), amyl nitrite promotes formation of methemoglobin, which combines with cyanide to form nontoxic cyanmethemoglobin."

976,"Molindone is used for the management of the manifestations of psychotic disorders.An indole derivative effective in schizophrenia and other psychoses and possibly useful in the treatment of the aggressive type of undersocialized conduct disorder. Molindone has much lower affinity for D2 receptors than most antipsychotic agents and has a relatively low affinity for D1 receptors. It has only low to moderate affinity for cholinergic and alpha-adrenergic receptors. Some electrophysiologic data from animals indicate that molindone has certain characteristics that resemble those of clozapine. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1994, p283)Molindone is a dihydroindolone compound which is not structurally related to the phenothiazines, the butyrophenones, or the thioxanthenes. Molindone has a pharmacological profile in laboratory animals which predominantly resembles that of major tranquilizers causing reduction of spontaneous locomotion and aggressiveness, suppression of a conditioned response and antagonism of the bizarre stereotyped behavior and hyperactivity induced by amphetamines. In addition, molindone antagonizes the depression caused by the tranquilizing agent tetrabenazine.The exact mechanism has not been established, however, based on electroencephalogram (EEG) studies, molindone is thought to act by occupying (antagonizing) dopamine (D2) receptor sites in the reticular limbic systems in the brain, thus decreasing dopamine activity. Decreased dopamine activity results in decreased physiological effects normally induced by excessive dopamine stimulation, such as those typically seen in manifestations of psychotic disorders."

982,"For the treatment of moderate to severe hypertension.Pargyline is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor with antihypertensive properties.Pargyline is a monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor with antihypertensive properties. Patients taking pargyline must avoid concurrent consumption of tyramine-containing foods such as bleu cheese and beer, as this can lead to a hypertensive crisis.MAOIs act by inhibiting the activity of monoamine oxidase, thus preventing the breakdown of monoamine neurotransmitters and thereby increasing their availability. There are two isoforms of monoamine oxidase, MAO-A and MAO-B. MAO-A preferentially deaminates serotonin, melatonin, epinephrine and norepinephrine. MAO-B preferentially deaminates phenylethylamine and trace amines. Pargyline functions by inhibiting the metabolism of catecholamines and tyramine within presynaptic nerve terminals. Catecholamines cause general physiological changes that prepare the body for physical activity (fight-or-flight response). Some typical effects are increases in heart rate, blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and a general reaction of the sympathetic nervous system."

Special care should therefore be exercised when used in elderly patients, individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, and those with a history of asthma or significant allergies. Lincomycin for injection may contain benzyl alcohol as a preservative, which has been associated with gasping syndrome in pediatric patients. The serum half-life is extended in patients with hepatic/renal impairment and may require dose adjustments and additional monitoring. Like all antibiotics, lincomycin use may cause overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, which should be considered.[L33214]Lincomycin contains the unusual amino acid moiety propyl hygric acid linked to the sugar moiety α-methylthiolincosamine (α-MTL) that, like other lincosamides, functions as a structural analogue of the 3' end of L-Pro-Met-tRNA and deacylated-tRNA to interact with the 23S rRNA of the 50S bacterial ribosomal subunit.[A190657, A190621] Detailed investigations into the mechanism of the related lincosamide [clindamycin] suggested a two-phase binding, instantaneously to the A-site with a shift in equilibrium towards the P-site over several seconds.[A233794, A233799, A233804] This shift appears to be due to rotation of the propyl hygric acid moiety, while the α-MTL remains relatively stationary.[A233804, A233819] Recent crystal structures of lincomycin in complex with the 50S ribosomal subunit of Staphylococcus aureus show that the α-MTL moiety forms hydrogen bonds with C2611, A2058, G2505, A2059, and G2503 of the 23S rRNA while the propyl hygric acid moiety interacts only through van der Waals contacts, suggesting it may be free to rotate similar to [clindamycin].[A233819] This mechanism is supported by the observation that the most common resistance mechanism, which also affects macrolides and streptogramin B (MSLB resistance) involves methylation of A2058; other resistance mechanisms similarly target residues such as A2058, A2059, and C2611.[A190621, A233819]"
984,"For the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, chronic low back pain, acute pain and gout.Etoricoxib is a new COX-2 selective inhibitor. Current therapeutic indications are: treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, chronic low back pain, acute pain and gout. Like any other COX-2 selective inhibitor, Etoricoxib selectively inhibits isoform 2 of cyclo-oxigenase enzyme (COX-2) to reduce the generation of prostaglandins (PGs) from arachidonic acid. It is approved in more than 60 countries worldwide but not in the US.Etoricoxib is a COX-2 selective inhibitor (approximately 106 times more selective for COX-2 inhibition over COX-1).Like any other COX-2 selective inhibitor Etoricoxib selectively inhibits isoform 2 of cyclo-oxigenase enzyme (COX-2), preventing production of prostaglandins (PGs) from arachidonic acid."

They are highly selective for PDE4 and are effectively inactive against PDEs 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7.[A251385] Roflumilast and its active metabolite (roflumilast N-oxide) are inhibitors of PDE4. Roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide inhibition of PDE4 (a major cyclic 3′,5′-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) metabolizing enzyme) activity leads to accumulation of intracellular cyclic AMP. The specific mechanism(s) by which roflumilast exerts its therapeutic action is not well defined.[L49276]"
987,"DHEA is taken as a supplement for a variety of unsubstantiated indications. The following indications have shown promise and are backed up by some scientific evidence: schizophrenia (DHEA may be more effective in women than men); improving the appearance of older people’s skin (taking DHEA by mouth seems to increase skin thickness and moisture, and decrease facial “age spots” in elderly men and women); improving ability to achieve an erection in men with sexual dysfunction. Additionally, DHEA has shown promise in improving symptoms of lupus (SLE). Taking DHEA by mouth along with conventional treatment may help reduce the number of times symptoms flare up and may allow a reduction in the dose of prescription drugs needed. DHEA may also help SLE symptoms such as muscle ache and mouth ulcers. DHEA also seems to strengthen bones in SLE patients being treated with high-dose steroids (corticosteroids).  DHEA also shows promise in the treatment of osteoporosis. Taking DHEA by mouth daily seems to improve bone mineral density (BMD) in older women and men with osteoporosis or osteopenia (pre-osteoporosis). DHEA may also increase BMD in young women with the eating disorder called anorexia nervosa. DHEA is often prescribed in India for the induction of ovulation to improve chances of pregnancy.Prasterone, also known as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a major C19 steroid produced by the adrenal cortex. It is also produced in small quantities in the testis and the ovary. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) can be converted to testosterone; androstenedione; estradiol; and estrone. Most of DHEA is sulfated (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate) before secretion.    In the United States, DHEA or DHEAS have been advertised with claims that they may be beneficial for a wide variety of ailments. DHEA and DHEAS are readily available in the United States, where they are marketed as over-the-counter dietary supplements. In November 2016, DHEA was approved (as Intrarosa) to treat women experiencing moderate to severe pain during sexual intercourse (dyspareunia), a symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA), due to menopause.    In Canada, a prescription is required to buy DHEA.DHEA is naturally produced from cholesterol through two cytochrome P450 enzymes. Cholesterol is converted to pregnenolone by the enzyme P450 scc (side chain cleavage); then another enzyme, CYP17A1, converts pregnenolone to 17α-Hydroxypregnenolone and then to DHEA. DHEA is increased by exercise and calorie restriction. Some theorize that the increase in endogenous DHEA brought about by calorie restriction is partially responsible for the longer life expectancy known to be associated with calorie restriction.DHEA can be understood as a prohormone for the sex steroids. DHEAS may be viewed as buffer and reservoir. As most DHEA is produced by the zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex, it is argued that there is a role in the immune and stress response. DHEAS/DHEA are useful to detect excess adrenal activity as seen in adrenal cancer or hyperplasia, including certain forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia as it is produced nearly entirely by the adrenal glands. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome tend to have elevated levels of DHEAS."
988,"For the treatment of bacterial infections (usually in combination with quinupristin).Dalfopristin is a combination of two antibiotics (Dalfopristin and quinupristin) used to treat infections by staphylococci and by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium.

989,"Studied for the treatment of many uses such as treatment of testicular torsion, diabetic ulceration, wound healing, acne, obesity, diabetic peripheral polyneuropathy. It has also been investigated for its hypolipidemic effects and as cholesterol lowering agent.Pantothenic acid, also called pantothenate or vitamin B5 (a B vitamin), is a water-soluble vitamin discovered by Roger J. Williams in 1919. For many animals, pantothenic acid is an essential nutrient as it is required to synthesize coenzyme-A (CoA), as well as to synthesize and metabolize proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Pantothenic acid is the amide between pantoic acid and β-alanine and commonly found as its alcohol analog, the provitamin panthenol, and as calcium pantothenate. Small quantities of pantothenic acid are found in nearly every food, with high amounts in whole-grain cereals, legumes, eggs, meat, royal jelly, avocado, and yogurt. Pantothenic acid is an ingredient in some hair and skin care products. Only the dextrorotatory (D) isomer of pantothenic acid possesses biological activity. while the levorotatory (L) form may antagonize the effects of the dextrorotatory isomer.Pantothenic acid is used in the synthesis of coenzyme A (CoA). CoA is thought to act as a carrier molecule, allowing the entry of acyl groups into cells. This is of critical importance as these acyl groups are used as substrates in the tricarboxylic acid cycle to generate energy and in the synthesis of fatty acids, cholesterol, and acetylcholine. Additionally, CoA is part of acyl carrier protein (ACP), which is required in the synthesis of fatty acids in addition to CoAs use as a substrate.     Pantothenic acid in the form of CoA is also required for acylation and acetylation, which, for example, are involved in signal transduction and enzyme activation and deactivation, respectively.    Since pantothenic acid participates in a wide array of key biological roles, it may have numerous wide-ranging effects.Pantothenic acid is incorporated into COENZYME A and protects cells against peroxidative damage by increasing the level of GLUTATHIONE."
990,"For the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with the menopause, atrophic vaginitis, osteoporosis, hypoestrogenism due to hypogonadism, castration, primary ovarian failure, breast cancer (for palliation only), and Advanced androgen-dependent carcinoma of the prostate (for palliation only)An estrogenic steroid produced by horses. It has a total of four double bonds in the A- and B-ring. High concentration of equilin is found in the urine of pregnant mares.Equilin is a component of Premarin (conjugated estrogens), a mixture of the water soluble salts of sulfate esters from estrone, equilin, 17 alpha-dihydroequilin, and other related steroids, may be derived from pregnant equine urine or yam and soy plants. Estrogens are important in the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sex characteristics. They promote growth and development of the vagina, uterus, and fallopian tubes, and enlargement of the breasts. Indirectly, they contribute to the shaping of the skeleton, maintenance of tone and elasticity of urogenital structures, changes in the epiphyses of the long bones that allow for the pubertal growth spurt and its termination, growth of axillary and pubic hair, and pigmentation of the nipples and genitals. Decline of estrogenic activity at the end of the menstrual cycle can bring on menstruation, although the cessation of progesterone secretion is the most important factor in the mature ovulatory cycle. However, in the preovulatory or nonovulatory cycle, estrogen is the primary determinant in the onset of menstruation. Estrogens also affect the release of pituitary gonadotropins. The pharmacologic effects of conjugated estrogens are similar to those of endogenous estrogens.Estrogens enter the cells of responsive tissues (e.g., female organs, breasts, hypothalamus, pituitary) where they interact with a protein receptor, subsequently increasing the rate of synthesis of DNA, RNA, and some proteins. Estrogens decrease the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone by the hypothalamus, reducing the secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary."

992,"For the treatment of moderate plaque psoriasis in adults.Calcipotriol (INN) or calcipotriene (USAN) is a sythetic derivative of calcitriol or Vitamin D.Calcipotriene is a synthetic analog of vitamin D. In humans, the natural supply of vitamin D depends mainly on exposure to the ultraviolet rays of the sun for conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) in the skin. The precise mechanism of calcipotriol in remitting psoriasis is not well-understood, however, it has been shown to have comparable affinity with calcitriol for the Vitamin D receptor while being less than 1% the activity in regulating calcium metabolism. The Vitamin D receptor (VDR) belongs to the steroid/thyroid receptor superfamily, and is found on the cells of many different tissues including the thyroid, bone, kindney, and T cells of the immune system. T cells are known to play a role in psoriasis and are believed to undergo modulation of gene expression with binding of calcipotriol to the VDR. This modulation is thought to affect gene products related to cell differentiation and proliferation."

996,"For the treatment of cutaneous manifestations in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma who have progressive, persistent or recurrent disease on or following two systemic therapies.Vorinostat (rINN) or suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), is a drug currently under investigation for the treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL), a type of skin cancer, to be used when the disease persists, gets worse, or comes back during or after treatment with other medicines. It is the first in a new class of agents known as histone deacetylase inhibitors.  A recent study suggested that vorinostat also possesses some activity against recurrent glioblastoma multiforme, resulting in a median overall survival of 5.7 months (compared to 4 - 4.4 months in earlier studies). Further brain tumor trials are planned using combinations of vorinostat with other drugs.Vorinostat inhibits the enzymatic activity of histone deacetylases HDAC1, HDAC2 and HDAC3 (Class I) and HDAC6 (Class II) at nanomolar concentrations (IC50&lt; 86 nM). These enzymes catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from the lysine residues of histones proteins. In some cancer cells, there is an overexpression of HDACs, or an aberrant recruitment of HDACs to oncogenic transcription factors causing hypoacetylation of core nucleosomal histones. By inhibiting histone deacetylase, vorinostat causes the accumulation of acetylated histones and induces cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis of some transformed cells. The mechanism of the antineoplastic effect of vorinostat has not been fully characterized."

1003,"For use as an antidepressant, appetite suppressant, and sleep aid.5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), also known as oxitriptan (INN), is a naturally occurring amino acid and metabolic intermediate in the synthesis of serotonin and melatonin. 5-HTP is sold over-the-counter in the United Kingdom, United States and Canada as a dietary supplement for use as an antidepressant, appetite suppressant, and sleep aid, and is also marketed in many European countries for the indication of major depression under trade names like Cincofarm, Levothym, Levotonine, Oxyfan, Telesol, Tript-OH, and Triptum. Several double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of 5-HTP in the treatment of depression, though a lack of high quality studies has been noted. More study is needed to determine efficacy in treating depression.The psychoactive action of 5-HTP is thought to be due to increased serotonin production in central nervous system tissue. "

1005,"Oteracil is used as an adjunct to antineoplastic therapy. When used within the product Teysuno, oteracil is indicated for the treatment of adults with advanced gastric (stomach) cancer when given in combination with cisplatin.Oteracil is an adjunct to antineoplastic therapy, used to reduce the toxic side effects associated with chemotherapy. Approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in March 2011, Oteracil is available in combination with [DB09257] and [DB09256] within the commercially available product ""Teysuno"". The main active ingredient in Teysuno is [DB09256], a pro-drug of [DB00544] (5-FU), which is a cytotoxic anti-metabolite drug that acts on rapidly dividing cancer cells. By mimicking a class of compounds called ""pyrimidines"" that are essential components of RNA and DNA, 5-FU is able to insert itself into strands of DNA and RNA, thereby halting the replication process necessary for continued cancer growth.    Oteracil's main role within Teysuno is to reduce the activity of 5-FU within normal gastrointestinal mucosa, and therefore reduce's gastrointestinal toxicity [L933]. It functions by blocking the enzyme orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRT), which is involved in the production of 5-FU.Oteracil's main role within Teysuno is to reduce the activity of 5-FU within normal gastrointestinal mucosa, and therefore reduce's gastrointestinal toxicity [L933].

1006,"Phenol is primarily indicated for minor sore throat pain, sore mouth, minor mouth irritation, and pain associated with canker sores. Additionally, phenol is indicated in the treatment of focal spasticity. Phenol is an antiseptic and disinfectant. It is active against a wide range of micro-organisms including some fungi and viruses, but is only slowly effective against spores. Phenol has been used to disinfect skin and to relieve itching. Phenol is also used as an oral analgesic or anesthetic in products such as Chloraseptic to treat pharyngitis. Additionally, phenol and its related compounds are used in surgical ingrown toenail treatment, a process termed phenolization. Research indicates that parental exposure to phenol and its related compounds are positively associated with spontaneous abortion. During the second world war, phenol injections were used as a means of execution by the Nazis. Phenol is a toxic compound whose vapours are corrosive to the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract.Phenol is a potent proteolytic agent. Concentrations in the 5% to 7% range dissolve tissue on contact via proteolysis. In high concentrations when injected next to a nerve, phenol produces a chemical neurolysis which is nonselective across nerve fiber size and most prominent on its outer aspect. Local anesthetic effects occur within 5-10 minutes. "
1007,"Aliskirin is a second-generation renin inhibitor, and a new generation of non peptide renin blockers. It can block the RAS system in the first stage, reduce renin activity, reduce the production of AngII and aldosterone, and do not affect the metabolism of bradykinin and prostaglandins. It plays a role in lowering blood pressure and treating cardiovascular diseases. From current research, it appears that Aligilen is a powerful, highly selective, orally effective, and long-lasting next-generation antihypertensive drug. The drug acts in a renin dependent manner, so increasing the dosage will only prolong the time and will not cause a sudden drop in blood pressure, similar to ARB (losartan, telmisartan). The incidence of adverse reactions is not significantly different from the placebo group."

1012,"Latamoxef is an oxacephem antibiotic usually grouped with the cephalosporins. It is used to treat bacterial infections. Latamoxef  is primarily indicated in conditions like Bone and joint infection, GI infections, Gynecological infections, Meningitis, Respiratory tract infections, Septicaemia, Skin infections, Soft tissue infections, UTI. Latamoxef is a broad- spectrum beta-lactam antibiotic similar in structure to the cephalosporins except for the substitution of an oxaazabicyclo moiety for the thiaazabicyclo moiety of certain cephalosporins. It has been proposed especially for the meningitides because it passes the blood-brain barrier and for anaerobic infections.Latamoxef works by inhibiting bacterial cell wall biosynthesis.Penicillins acylate the penicillin-sensitive transpeptidase C-terminal domain (the penicillin-binding protein) by opening the lactam ring. This inactivation of the enzyme prevents the formation of a cross-link of two linear peptidoglycan strands, inhibiting the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that amoxicllin interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."

1014,"Used as a test to determine the general health of an unborn fetus.A hydroxylated metabolite of estradiol or estrone that has a hydroxyl group at C3-beta, 16-alpha, and 17-beta position. Estriol is a major urinary estrogen. During pregnancy, large amount of estriol is produced by the placenta. Isomers with inversion of the hydroxyl group or groups are called epiestriol. Though estriol is used as part of the primarily North American phenomenon of bioidentical hormone replacement therapy, it is not approved for use by the FDA or Health Canada. It is however available in the United States by prescription filled only by compounding pharmacies. It has also been approved and marketed throughout Europe and Asia for approximately 40 years for the treatment of post-menopausal hot flashes.Estriol (also oestriol) is one of the three main estrogens produced by the human body. It is only produced in significant amounts during pregnancy as it is made by the placenta. In pregnant women with multiple sclerosis (MS), estriol reduces the disease's symptoms noticeably, according to researchers at UCLA's Geffen Medical School.Estriol levels can be measured to give an indication of the general health of the fetus. DHEA-S is produced by the adrenal cortex of the fetus. This is converted to estriol by the placenta. If levels of ""unconjugated estriol"" are abnormally low in a pregnant woman, this may indicate a problem with the development of the child. The drug interacts with a target cell receptor. When the estrogen receptor has bound its ligand it can enter the nucleus of the target cell, and regulate gene transcription which leads to formation of messenger RNA. The mRNA interacts with ribosomes to produce specific proteins that express the effect of estriol upon the target cell. Estrogens increase the hepatic synthesis of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), thyroid-binding globulin (TBG), and other serum proteins and suppress follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary."

1017,"For the treatment of bacterial infections in animals.Apramycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic and has a bactericidal action against many gram-negative bacteria. Apramycin is a structurally unique antibiotic that contains a bicyclic sugar moiety and a monosubstituted deoxystreptamine. It is not approved for use in humans.Apramycin stands out among aminoglycosides for its mechanism of action which is based on blocking translocation and its ability to bind also to the eukaryotic decoding site despite differences in key residues required for apramycin recognition by the bacterial target. The drug binds in the deep groove of the RNA which forms a continuously stacked helix comprising non-canonical C.A and G.A base pairs and a bulged-out adenine. The binding mode of apramycin at the human decoding-site RNA is distinct from aminoglycoside recognition of the bacterial target, suggesting a molecular basis for the actions of apramycin in eukaryotes and bacteria."

The contrast medium appears in the bile within 10 to 15 minutes after injection, thus permitting visualization of the hepatic and common bile ducts, even in cholecystectomized patients. The biliary ducts are readily visualized within about 25 minutes after administration, except in patients with impaired liver function. The gallbladder begins to fill within an hour after injection; maximum filling is reached after two to two and one-half hours. The contrast medium is finally eliminated in the feces without passing through the enterohepatic circulation, except for approximately 10 percent of the intravenously administered dose which is excreted through the kidneys.Organic iodine compounds block x-rays as they pass through the body, thereby allowing body structures containing iodine to be delineated in contrast to those structures that do not contain iodine. The degree of opacity produced by these iodinated organic compounds is directly proportional to the total amount (concentration and volume) of the iodinated contrast agent in the path of the x-rays. Iodipamide's primary excretion through the hepato-biliary system and concentration in bile allows visualization of the gallbladder and biliary ducts."
1020,"For the treatment of acute pain, the symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis and primary dysmenorrhoea in adolescents and adults above 12 years old.Nimesulide is a relatively COX-2 selective, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with analgesic and antipyretic properties. Its approved indications are the treatment of acute pain, the symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis and primary dysmenorrhoea in adolescents and adults above 12 years old. Due to concerns about the risk of hepatotoxicity, nimesulide has been withdrawn from market in many countries.Food, gender and advanced age have negligible effects on nimesulide pharmacokinetics.The therapeutic effects of Nimesulide are the result of its complete mode of action which targets a number of key mediators of the inflammatory process such as: COX-2 mediated prostaglandins, free radicals, proteolytic enzymes and histamine."

The sedative-hypnotic activity was first noted by Indian researchers in the 1950s and in 1962 methaqualone itself was patented in the US by Wallace and Tiernan. Its use peaked in the early 1970s as a hypnotic, sedative, and muscle relaxant commonly used for insomnia. It has also been used illegally as a recreational drug, commonly known as Quaaludes, Sopors, Ludes or Mandrax (particularly in the 1970s in North America) depending on the manufacturer. Since at least 2001, it has been widely used in South Africa, where it is commonly referred to as ""smarties"" or ""geluk-tablette"" (meaning happy tablets).

1031,"Treatment of hyperkinetic movement disorders like chorea in Huntington's disease, hemiballismus, senile chorea, Tourette syndrome and other tic disorders, and tardive dyskinesia A drug formerly used as an antipsychotic but now used primarily in the symptomatic treatment of various hyperkinetic disorders. It is a monoamine depletor and used as symptomatic treatment of chorea associated with Huntington's disease. FDA approved on August 15, 2008.Prolongation of the QTc interval has been observed at doses of 50 mg. In rats, it has been observed that tetrabenazine or its metabolites bind to melanin-containing tissues such as the eyes and skin. After a single oral dose of radiolabeled tetrabenazine, radioactivity was still detected in eye and fur at 21 days post dosing. Tetrabenazine is a reversible human vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 inhibitor (Ki = 100 nM). It acts within the basal ganglia and promotes depletion of monoamine neurotransmitters serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine from stores. It also decreases uptake into synaptic vesicles. Dopamine is required for fine motor movement, so the inhibition of its transmission is efficacious for hyperkinetic movement. Tetrabenazine exhibits weak in vitro binding affinity at the dopamine D2 receptor (Ki = 2100 nM)."
1032,"Investigated for use/treatment in breast cancer, head and neck cancer, melanoma, lung cancer, lymphoma (non-hodgkin's), prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and cancer/tumors (unspecified).Ixabepilone is an epothilone B analog developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb as a cancer drug. It was FDA approved on October 16, 2007, for the treatment of unresponsive aggressive metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer. Ixabepilone is administered through injection, and will be marketed under the trade name Ixempra. Ixabepilone is a semisynthetic analogue of epothilone B. It has a lactone–lactam modification that minimizes susceptibility to esterase degradation.Binding of Ixabepilone to beta-tubulins (e.g. beta-III tubulin) stabilizes microtubules. Microtubules are essential to cell division, and epothilones therefore stop cells from properly dividing. Like taxol, Ixabepilone binds to the αβ-tubulin heterodimer subunit. Once bound, the rate of αβ-tubulin dissociation decreases, thus stabilizing the microtubules."
1033,"Celiprolol is indicated for the management of mild to moderate hypertension and effort-induced angina pectoris. Celiprolol is indicated for the management of mild to moderate hypertension and effort-induced angina pectoris. It is simultaneously a selective β1 receptor antagonist, a β2 receptor partial agonist and a weak α2 receptor antagonist. In 2010 a clinical trial has suggested a use for this medication in the prevention of vascular complications of a rare inherited disease called vascular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome. This study demonstrated decreased incidence of arterial rupture or dissection (a specific type of arterial rupture in which the layers of the vessel separate prior to complete failure of the artery wall). Celiprolol is not approved for use by the FDA in the treatment of vascular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome.Celiprolol is a vasoactive beta-1 selective adrenoceptor antagonist with partial beta-2 agonist activity. The beta-2 agonist activity is thought to account for its mild vasodilating properties. It lowers blood pressure in hypertensive patients at rest and on exercise. The effects on heart rate and cardiac output are dependent on the pre-existing background level of sympathetic tone.  Under conditions of stress such as exercise, celiprolol attenuates chronotropic and inotropic responses to sympathetic stimulation. However, at rest minimal impairment of cardiac function is seen. "
1034,"Roxadustat is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with symptomatic anemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD).[L40318]Roxadustat is a first-in-class hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor used to treat anemia associated with chronic kidney disease. It works by reducing the breakdown of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), which is a transcription factor that stimulates red blood cell production in response to low oxygen levels.[A245393] Roxadustat was first approved by the European Commission in August 2021.[L40323]Roxadustat dose-dependently improves iron bioavailability, increases hemoglobin production, and increases red blood cell mass in patients with anemia.[L40318] In non-dialysis-dependent CKD patients with anemia, roxadustat maintained Hb for up to 2 years. It has a comparable efficacy to erythropoietin-stimulating agents in achieving Hb response.[A245393] Roxadustat also reduces cholesterol levels from baseline, regardless of the use of statins or other lipid-lowering agents.[A245363]Anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease that may be caused by reduced production of renal erythropoietin (EPO), functional iron deficiency due to increased levels of hepcidin, blood loss, reduced erythrocyte survival duration, and inflammation.[A245363, A245393] Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is a transcription factor that induces several target oxygen-sensitive genes in response to low oxygen levels in the cellular environment, or hypoxia. Target genes are involved in erythropoiesis, such as those for EPO, EPO receptor, proteins promoting iron absorption, iron transport, and haem synthesis.[A245363] Activation of the HIF pathway is an important adaptive responsive to hypoxia to increase red blood cell production.[L40318] HIF is heterodimeric and contains an oxygen-regulated α-subunit. The α-subunit houses an oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domain that is regulated and hydroxylated by HIF-prolyl hydroxylase (HIF-PHD) enzymes under normoxic cellular conditions.[A245398] HIF-PHD enzymes play a crucial role in maintaining a balance between oxygen availability and HIF activity.[A245363]    Roxadustat is a reversible and potent inhibitor of HIF-PHD enzymes: inhibition of HIF-PHD leads to the accumulation of functional HIF, an increase in plasma endogenous EPO production, enhanced erythropoiesis, and indirect suppression of hepcidin, which is an iron regulator protein that is increased during inflammation in chronic kidney disease.[L40318] Roxadustat can also regulate iron transporter proteins [L40318] and regulates iron metabolism by increasing serum transferrin, intestinal iron absorption and the release of stored iron in patients with anemia associated with dialysis-dependent or dialysis-independent CKD.[A245363] Overall, roxadustat improves iron bioavailability, increases Hb production, and increases red cell mass.[A245363, L40318] "
1035,"Febuxostat is indicated for the chronic management of hyperuricemia in adult patients with gout who have an inadequate response to a maximally titrated dose of [allopurinol], who are intolerant to allopurinol, or for whom treatment with allopurinol is not advisable.[L46073] It is not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia [L32238] or secondary hyperuricemia.[A230583] Febuxostat is a non-purine xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitor.[A39743] In early 2008, febuxostat was granted marketing authorization by the European Commission for the treatment of chronic hyperuricemia and gout.[A230548] In the following year, the FDA for approved febuxostat for use in the chronic management of hyperuricemia in adult patients with gout who have an inadequate response or intolerance to [allopurinol].[L32238] Gout is a form of arthritis that is caused by the accumulation of uric acid crystal in or around a joint, leading to inflammation and further deposition of uric acid crystal deposition in bones, joints, tissues, and other organs in the long term. Gout is closely associated with hyperuricemia. Febuxostat works by inhibiting the activity of an enzyme that is responsible for the synthesis of uric acid, thereby reducing serum uric acid levels.[A230548]     In February 2019, a black box warning for febuxostat was added, based on the findings of a post-market clinical study (the CARES trial) where there was an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) fatal outcomes in patients with gout and known cardiovascular disease treated with febuxostat, when compared to those treated with allopurinol. The manufacturer and the FDA advise health professionals to limit the use of febuxostat to second-line therapy in patients who have inadequate response or intolerance to allopurinol, and to avoid the use of febuxostat in patients with cardiovascular diseases.[A2742, L13056]Febuxostat is a novel, selective xanthine oxidase/dehydrogenase inhibitor that works by decreasing serum uric acid in a dose-dependent manner. In healthy subjects, febuxostat decreased the mean serum uric acid and serum xanthine concentrations, as well as the total urinary uric acid excretion. Febuxostat at daily doses of 40-80 mg reduced the 24-hour mean serum uric acid concentrations by 40 to 55%.[L32238] Closely related to the drug-induced reduction of serum uric acid levels and mobilization of urate crystals in tissue deposits, febuxostat is associated with gout flares.[A230583]     Unlike [allopurinol] and [oxypurinol], febuxostat has no inhibitory actions against other enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis and metabolism, because it does not structurally resemble purines or pyrimidines.[A230548] Gout is a form of acute arthritis that is characterized by the accumulation of crystals of monosodium urate and urate crystals in or around a joint, leading to inflammation and persistent urate crystal deposition in bones, joints, tissues, and other organs that may exacerbate over time. Hyperuricemia is closely related to gout, whereby it may exist for many years before the first clinical attack of gout; thus, aberrated serum uric acid levels and hyperuricemia are believed to be the biochemical aberration involved in the pathogenesis of gout.[A230548] Xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) can act as a xanthine oxidase or xanthine dehydrogenase. In humans, it is a critical enzyme for uric acid production as it catalyzes the oxidation reaction steps from hypoxanthine to xanthine and from xanthine to uric acid in the pathway of purine metabolism.[A19658] Febuxostat potently inhibits XOR, blocking both its oxidase and dehydrogenase activities. With high affinity, febuxostat binds to XOR in a molecular channel leading to the molybdenum-pterin active site, where [allopurinol] demonstrates relatively weak competitive inhibition.[A230548]     XOR is mainly found in the dehydrogenase form under normal physiological conditions; however, in inflammatory conditions, XOR can be converted into the xanthine oxidase form, which catalyzes reactions that produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as peroxynitrite. ROS contribute to vascular inflammation and alterations in vascular function. As febuxostat can inhibit both forms of XOR, it can inhibit ROS formation, oxidative stress, and inflammation.[A2743] In a rat model, febuxostat suppressed renal ischemia-reperfusion injury by attenuating oxidative stress.[A2744]"
1036,"Dronedarone is indicated for the management of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients in sinus rhythm with a history of paroxysmal or persistent AF to reduce the risk of hospitalization.[L8699]Dronedarone is a Class III antiarrhythmic drug that works to restore the normal sinus rhythm in patients with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is a common sustained arrhythmia where the treatment primarily focuses on stroke prevention and symptom management. It is managed by rate control, rhythm control, prevention of thromboembolic events, and treatment of the underlying disease.[A34604] Similar to [amiodarone], dronedarone is a multichannel blocker that works to control rhythm and rate in atrial fibrillation.[A186071] It meets criteria of all four Vaughan Williams antiarrhythmic drug classes by blocking sodium, potassium, and calcium ion channels and inhibiting β-adrenergic receptors.[A34604,L8699]     Dronedarone is a related benzofuran compound to amiodarone but its chemical structure lacks iodine moieties which are associated with amiodarone-induced thyroid problems.[A34604,T28] Additionally, the methyl sulfonyl group in its structure renders dronedarone to be more lipophilic with a shorter half-life than amiodarone.[A34604] This ultimately leads to reduced tissue accumulation of the drug and decreased risk for organ toxicities, such as thyroid and pulmonary toxicities.[T28] Commonly marketed as Multaq®, dronedarone was approved by the FDA in July 2009 and Health Canada in August 2009. A safety concern for the risk of drug-induced hepatocellular injury has been issued following marketing of dronedarone.[L8800]Dronedarone is an antiarrhythmic agent that restores normal sinus rhythm and reduces heart rate in atrial fibrillation. In another model, it prevents ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation.[L8684] Dronedarone moderately prolongs the QTc interval by about 10 ms on average.[L8699] Dronedarone decreases arterial blood pressure and reduces oxygen consumption. It reduces myocardial contractility with no change in left ventricular ejection fraction. Dronedarone vasodilates coronary arteries through activation of the nitric oxide pathway.[L8684] In clinical studies, dronedarone reduced incidence of hospitalizations for acute coronary syndromes and reduced incidence of stroke.[A186077] Dronedarone exhibits antiadrenergic effects by reducing alpha-adrenergic blood pressure response to epinephrine and beta 1 and beta 2 responses to isoproterenol.[L8684]     Dronedarone was shown to inhibit triiodothyronine (T3) signalling by binding to TRα1 but much less so to TRβ1.[A187138] The treatment of dronedarone in patients with severe heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction was associated with increased early mortality related to the worsening of heart failure.[A186080] In animal studies, the use of dronedarone at doses equivalent to the recommended human doses was associated with fetal harm. In clinical studies and postmarketing reports, dronedarone was shown to cause hepatocellular liver injury and pulmonary toxicities, such as interstitial lung disease, pneumonitis, and pulmonary fibrosis.[L8699] Compared to its related compound [amiodarone], dronedarone has a faster onset and offset of actions with a shorter elimination half-life and low tissue accumulation.[A34604,T28]Atrial fibrillation is the most common type of arrhythmia that is caused by abnormal electrical activity in the atria. In atrial fibrillation, tachyarrhythmia, or fast heart rate, can either be paroxysmal (less than 7 days) or persistent (more than 7 days). Atrial fibrillation causes turbulent and abnormal blood flow through the heart chambers, leading to decreased the effectiveness of the heart to pump blood and an increased likelihood of thrombus formation within the atria which can ultimately dislodge and cause a stroke.[L8980]     Dronedarone achieves heart rate and rhythm control in atrial fibrillation. _In vitro_, dronedarone decreased the maximum rate of the rise of an action potential in a concentration- and frequency-dependent manner.[A186071] Cardiac action potentials are generated by ionic currents of multiple voltage-gated ion channels, including potassium, sodium, and calcium channels.[A187129] Dronedarone is a multichannel blocker that meets the criteria of all four Vaughan Williams antiarrhythmic drug classes[A34604] but the contribution of each of these activities to the drug's antiarrhythmic effect is unknown.[L8699] Dronedarone inhibits rapid Na+ currents rate-dependently (class Ib), non-competitively antagonizes α– and β-adrenergic receptors (class II), blocks K+ outward currents (class III) and blocks slow Ca2+ inward currents (class IV).[A34604] More specifically, it decreases delayed-rectifier K+ current (IKr), slowly activating delayed-rectifier K+ current (IKs), inward rectifier potassium current (IK1), peak Na+ current (INa) and L-type Ca2+ current (ICa (L)).[A186071,A186077] Dronedarone ultimately increases refractory periods, decelerates cardiac conduction, and prolongs cardiac action potential and refractory periods.[A34604,L8684]"
1037,"Nebivolol is indicated to treat hypertension.[A2762,A182579,L7985,L7988]Nebivolol is a racemic mixture of 2 enantiomers where one is a beta adrenergic antagonist and the other acts as a cardiac stimulant without beta adrenergic activity.[A182579] Treatment with nebivolol leads to a greater decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure than [atenolol], [propranolol], or [pindolol].[A182579] Nebivolol and other beta blockers are generally not first line therapies as many patients are first treated with thiazide diuretics.[A182594]    Nebivolol was granted FDA approval on 17 December 2007.[L7985]Nebivolol is a selective beta-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist that decreases vascular resistance, increases stroke volume and cardiac output, and does not negatively affect left ventricular function.[A182579,A182585] It has a long duration of action as effects can be seen 48 hours after stopping the medication and a wide therapeutic window as patients generally take 5-40mg daily.[A182579,L7985] Patients should not abruptly stop taking this medication as this may lead to exacerbation of coronary artery disease.[L7985] Diabetic patients should monitor their blood glucose levels as beta blockers may mask signs of hypoglycemia.[L7985]Nebivolol is a highly selective beta-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist[A182579] with weak beta-2 adrenergic receptor antagonist activity.[A182585] Blocking beta-1 adrenergic receptors by d-nebivolol leads to decreased resting heart rate, exercise heart rate, myocardial contracility, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure.[A182603,A182579,A182585,A182615] The selectivity of d-nebivolol limits the magnitude of beta blocker adverse effects in the airways or relating to insulin sensitivity.[A182615] Nebivolol also inhibits aldosterone, and beta-1 antagonism in the juxtaglomerular apparatus also inhibits the release of renin.[A182615] Decreased aldosterone leads to decreased blood volume, and decreased renin leads to reduced vasoconstriction.[A182615] l-nebivolol is responsible for beta-3 adrenergic receptor agonist activity that stimulates endothelial nitric oxide synthase, increasing nitric oxide levels; leading to vasodilation, decreased peripheral vascular resistance, increased stroke volume, ejection fraction, and cardiac output.[A2762,A182603,A182579,A182585,A182615] The vasodilation, reduced oxidative stress, and reduced platelet volume and aggregation of nebivolol may lead to benefits in heart failure patients.[A182603]"
1038,"Used in patients who are intolerant and/or resistant to two or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors used to treat accelerated or chronic phase CML.Omacetaxine mepesuccinate (formerly known as HHT or Homoharringtonine), is a cephalotaxine ester and protein synthesis inhibitor with established clinical activity as a single agent in hematological malignancies. Omacetaxine mepesuccinate  is synthesized from cephalotaxine, which is an extract from the leaves of the plant, Cephalotaxus species. In October 2005, omacetaxine mepesuccinate received Orphan Drug designation from the EMEA for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Then in March 2006, it received Orphan Drug status from the FDA for the treatment of CML. In November 2006, omacetaxine mepesuccinate, for the treatment of CML, was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA. Most recently, in October 2012, omacetaxine mepesuccinate was marketed under the brand name Synribo and FDA approved for patients who are intolerant and/or resistant to two or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors used to treat accelerated or chronic phase CML.The pharmacodynamics of homoharringtonine is not fully understood. It is known that homoharringtonine is involved  with protein synthesis inhibition and this leads to its antineoplastic activity.  Homoharringtonine inhibits protein synthesis by not directly binding to Bcr-Abl. It binds to the A-site cleft in the large ribosomal subunit, which affects chain elongation and prevents protein synthesis.     "
1039,"For the potential treatment of various leukemias, including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).Nilotinib, also known as AMN107, is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor under investigation as a possible treatment for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). A Phase I clinical trial in 2006 showed that this drug was relatively safe and offered significant therapeutic benefits in cases of CML which were found to be resistant to treatment with imatinib (Gleevec), another tyrosine kinase inhibitor used as a first-line treatment for CML.Nilotinib is a transduction inhibitor that targets BCR-ABL, c-kit and PDGF, for the potential treatment of various leukemias, including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).Chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) is caused by the BCR-ABL oncogene. Nilotinib inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the BCR-ABL protein. Nilotinib fits into the ATP-binding site of the BCR-ABL protein with higher affinity than imatinib, over-riding resistance caused by mutations. The ability of AMN107 to inhibit TEL-platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta (TEL-PDGFRbeta), which causes chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia, and FIP1-like-1-PDGFRalpha, which causes hypereosinophilic syndrome, suggests potential use of AMN107 for myeloproliferative diseases characterised by these kinase fusions (Stover et al, 2005; Weisberg et al, 2005). AMN107 also inhibits the c-Kit receptor kinase, including the D816V-mutated variant of KIT, at pharmacologically achievable concentrations, supporting potential utility in the treatment of mastocytosis, and gastrointestinal stromal tumours (Weisberg et al, 2005; von Bubnoff et al, 2005; Gleixner et al, 2006)."
1040,"For the treatment of diabetes. It is specifically used for lowering post-prandial blood glucose levels thereby reducing the risk of macrovascular complications.Voglibose is an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor used for lowering post-prandial blood glucose levels in people with diabetes mellitus. It is made in India by Ranbaxy Labs and sold under the trade name Volix.Voglibose, an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, is a synthetic compound with potent and enduring therapeutic efficacies against disorders of sensory, motor and autonomic nerve systems due to diabetes mellitus. The drug was approved in Japan in 1994 for the treatment of diabetes, and it is under further investigation by Takeda for the treatment of impaired glucose tolerance. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors are oral anti-diabetic drugs used for diabetes mellitus type 2 that work by preventing the digestion of complex carbohydrates (such as starch). Complex carbohydrates are normally converted into simple sugars (monosaccharides) which can be absorbed through the intestine. Hence, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors reduce the impact of complex carbohydrates on blood sugar.Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors are saccharides that act as competitive inhibitors of enzymes needed to digest carbohydrates: specifically alpha-glucosidase enzymes in the brush border of the small intestines. The membrane-bound intestinal alpha-glucosidases hydrolyze oligosaccharides, trisaccharides, and disaccharides to glucose and other monosaccharides in the small intestine. Acarbose also blocks pancreatic alpha-amylase in addition to inhibiting membrane-bound alpha-glucosidases. Pancreatic alpha-amylase hydrolyzes complex starches to oligosaccharides in the lumen of the small intestine. Inhibition of these enzyme systems reduces the rate of digestion of complex carbohydrates. Less glucose is absorbed because the carbohydrates are not broken down into glucose molecules. In diabetic patients, the short-term effect of these drugs therapies is to decrease current blood glucose levels: the long term effect is a small reduction in hemoglobin-A1c level.

1041,"For the treatment of congestive heart failure.Enoximone is a selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor with vasodilating and positive inotropic activity that does not cause changes in myocardial oxygen consumption. It is used in patients with congestive heart failure. Trials were halted in the U.S., but the drug is used in various countries.Enoximone is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (type III) that increases the force of contraction of the heart and dilates blood vessels. In June 2005, Myogen announced that they were discontinuing development of enoximone due to negative results. The drug is approved for use in the UK.Further research is required to determine accurately the mechanism of action of drugs with phosphodiesterase inhibitory activity, however, inhibition of PDE3 inhibits degredation of cGMP. This allows for increased NO release and vascular relaxation."
1042,"For the treatment of premature ejaculation.Dapoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, for the treatment of premature ejaculation. In a phase II proof-of-concept study conducted by PPD, dapoxetine demonstrated a statistically significant increase in ejaculatory latency when compared to placebo. Alza submitted a NDA to the FDA for dapoxetine for the treatment of premature ejaculation in December 2004. In October 2005, the company received a FDA Non-Approvable letter from the FDA, at which time they planned to work with regulators to address outstanding questions.Dapoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor currently undergoing trials through Alza (under license from GenuPro, a collaboration between Eli Lilly and PPD). Dapoxetine is a short-acting SSRI drug currently being considered for approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of premature ejaculation in men, which would make it the first drug approved for such treatment. Despite two clinical trials finished in 2006, experts doubt it will be approved by the FDA soon because SSRIs come with undesirable side-effects after long-term use, such as psychiatric problems, dermatological reactions, increase in body weight, lower sex-drive, nausea, headache, upset stomach and weakness, thus not significantly outweighing the benefit of premature ejaculation medication versus the risks. By contrast with SSRIs approved for depression, which take 2 weeks or longer to reach steady-state concentration, dapoxetine has a unique pharmacokinetic profile, with a short time to maximum serum concentration (about 1 h) and rapid elimination (initial half-life of 1-2 h).The drug's mechanism of action is thought to be related to inhibition of neuronal reuptake of serotonin and subsequent potentiation of serotonin activity. The central ejaculatory neural circuit comprises spinal and cerebral areas that form a highly interconnected network. The sympathetic, parasympathetic, and somatic spinal centers, under the influence of sensory genital and cerebral stimuli integrated and processed at the spinal cord level, act in synergy to command physiologic events occurring during ejaculation. Experimental evidence indicates that serotonin (5-HT), throughout brain descending pathways, exerts an inhibitory role on ejaculation. To date, three 5-HT receptor subtypes (5-HT(1A), 5-HT(1B), and 5-HT(2C)) have been postulated to mediate 5-HT's modulating activity on ejaculation."

Phase III studies of cilansetron had been suspended by Solvay in order to assess whether the drug possesses safety concerns similar to alosetron. Alosetron, also a 5-HT3 antagonist, was withdrawn from the market due to questions regarding its safety. Phase III testing with cilansetron has since resumed. In June 2005 the company announced that they were reviewing the priority of the cilansetron program.Cilansetron is a potent and selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. 5-HT3 receptors are nonselective cation channels that are extensively distributed on enteric neurons in the human gastrointestinal tract, as well as other peripheral and central locations. Activation of these channels and the resulting neuronal depolarization affect the regulation of visceral pain, colonic transit and gastrointestinal secretions, processes that relate to the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). 5-HT3 receptor antagonists such as cilansetron inhibit activation of non-selective cation channels which results in the modulation of the enteric nervous system."
1044,"For the treatment of HIV-1 infection.Brecanavir (VX-385) an orally active aspartic protease inhibitor (PI), under investigation by Vertex and GlaxoSmithKline for the treatment of HIV. In July 2006, Vertex indicated that it expected GSK to initiate phase III trials of the drug in 2007. In December of 2006 GSK announced a decision to discontinue the development of brecanavir for the treatment of HIV. The decision was based on issues regarding the formulation of the drug.Test-tube data suggest that it has activity against virus with resistance to the currently available protease inhibitors, and that it is more powerful against wild-type HIV that existing protease inhibitors, being active at concentrations much lower than most existing protease inhibitors. Unlike some other protease inhibitors, brecanavir does not have a significant interaction with the nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NtRTI) tenofovir (Viread). In December of 2006 GlaxoSmithKline announced their decision to discontinue the development of brecanavir for the treatment of HIV. The decision was based on issues regarding the formulation of the drug.Brecanavir inhibits the HIV viral proteinase enzyme which prevents cleavage of the gag-pol polyprotein, resulting in noninfectious, immature viral particles."
1045,"For the symptomatic treatment of itchy eyes (caused by IgE-induced mast cell degranulation) due to allergic conjunctivitis.Bepotastine is a non-sedating, selective antagonist of the histamine 1 (H1) receptor. Bepotastine was approved in Japan for use in the treatment of allergic rhinitis and uriticaria/puritus in July 2000 and January 2002, respectively, and is marketed by Tanabe Seiyaku Co., Ltd. under the brand name Talion. It is available in oral and opthalmic dosage forms in Japan. The opthalmic solution is FDA approved since Sept 8, 2009 and is under the brand name Bepreve.Bepotastine is a non-sedating, selective antagonist of the histamine 1 (H1) receptor. It belongs to the second-generation piperidine chemical class. It is a mast cell stabilizer and suppresses the migration of eosinophils into inflamed tissues. Furthermore, bepotastine does not interact with serotonin, muscarinic, benzodiazepine, and beta-adrenergic receptor that would otherwise result in adverse reactions such as dry mouth or sonmolence.    Onset of action = 0.25 hours;   Duration of action = 12-24 hours; Because of a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction cascade that is triggered by antigen exposure, allergic conjunctivitis occurs. Allergen exposure is followed by conjunctival mast cell degranulation and histamine released as a result of the formation of complementary IgE cross-links on the conjunctiva. Due to the release of histamine, symptoms such as itching can be observed. Bepotastine works to relieve itchy eyes by three primary mechanisms of action. It is a non-sedating, selective antagonist of the histamine 1 (H1) receptor, a mast cell stabilizer, and it suppresses the migration of eosinophils into inflamed tissues to prevent tissue damage and worsening of allergic inflammation of the conjunctiva. "
1046,"For the treatment of esophageal variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhotic liver disease and has also shown efficacy in the treatment of patients with AIDS-related diarrhea.Vapreotide is a synthetic octapeptide somatostatin analog. It was being studied for the treatment of cancer.Vapreotide is a somatostatin analog with a higher metabolic stability than the parent hormone. Vapreotide reduces splanchnic blood flow; inhibits growth hormone release, and inhibits the release of peptides and vasoactive compounds from neuroendocrine tumors.The exact mechanism of action is unknown, although one study has provided in vitro and in vivo evidence for a tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonist effect in the analgesic effects of vapreotide (PMID: 7556407)."
1047,"Milnacipran is a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) indicated for the management of fibromyalgia in patients that are 18 years old or above [F3925].     While milnacipran may be used for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), it is only recommended in adult patients who are 18 years old or above [F3922] due to an increased risk for suicidal ideation, thinking, and behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults taking antidepressants for major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Some regional prescribing information notes that the use of the medication is specifically for the short-term symptomatic relief of MDD [F3919]. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the regulatory approval of and/or indications listed here for milnacipran may or may not exist and/or vary greatly between regions and nations [F3928, F3934].Milnacipran is a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) and like many agents in this category was originally developed for and continues to be approved and indicated for the treatment of depression [F3928, F3934, A175786, A175951]. Furthermore, in 2009 the US FDA approved milnacipran for the additional indication of treating fibromyalgia [F3925], although other regional regulatory authorities like the EMA, among others, have not yet approved the agent for such treatment, citing lack of robust evidence of efficacy, insufficient demonstration of maintenance of effect, and other concerns [F3928, F3934]. Nevertheless, milnacipran demonstrates a somewhat unique characteristic among SNRIs to elicit a relatively balanced reuptake inhibition of both serotonin and noradrenaline, with a somewhat increased preference for noradrenaline reuptake inhibition - which is potentially a point of interest given the plausible proposal that noradrenaline plays an important role in the mitigation of pain signals in the descending inhibitory pain pathways in the brain and spinal cord [A175759, A175843, A175846].    Moreover, recent research has shown that the levorotatory enantiomer of milnacipran, levomilnacipran, may have the capacity to inhibit the activity of beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE-1), which has investigationally been associated with β-amyloid plaque formation - making the agent a possible course of treatment for Alzheimer's disease [A175957].When utilized to treat fibromyalgia, the effect of milnacipran on the QTcF interval in patients was measured in a double-blind placebo-and positive-controlled parallel study in 88 healthy subjects using three to six times the recommended therapeutic dose for fibromyalgia at 600 mg/day [F3925]. After baseline and placebo adjustment, the maximum mean QTcF change was 8 ms - an increase that is generally not considered to be clinically significant [F3925].    Conversely, when used for treating major depressive disorder (MDD), non-clinical studies have shown that levomilnacipran binds with high affinity to the norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT) transporters (Ki = 71-91 nM and 11 nM respectively at human transporters) [F3919, F3922, F3925]. Levomilnacipran inhibits the uptake of both NE and 5-HT in vitro and in vivo; preferentially inhibiting reuptake of NE over 5-HT by approximately 2-fold [F3919, F3922, F3925]. Levomilnacipran does not directly affect the uptake of dopamine or other neurotransmitters [F3919, F3922, F3925]. Levomilnacipran has no significant affinity for serotonergic (5-HT1-7), α- and β-adrenergic, muscarinic (M1-5), histamine (H1-4), dopamine (D1-5), opiate, benzodiazepine, and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors in vitro [F3919, F3922]. Levomilnacipran has no significant affinity for Ca++, K+, Na+, and Cl– channels and does not inhibit the activity of human monoamine oxidases (MAO-A and MAO-B) or acetylcholinesterase [F3919, F3922, F3925].    Moreover, in ECG studies with levomilnacipran used to treat MDD, although no clinically significant changes in QTcF interval (QTcF=QT/RR0.33) were noted, it appears that the agent can cause increases in heart rate and blood pressure [F3919]. In particular, it appears that the maximum therapeutic dose of levomilnacipran at 120 mg/day is capable of causing a maximum mean difference in heart rate from placebo of 20.2 bpm and a mean difference in systolic and diastolic blood pressure from placebo ranging from 3.8 to 7.2 mmHg and 6.1 to 8.1 mmHg, respectively [F3919]. Alternatively, a supratherapeutic dose of 300 mg/day is capable of causing a maximum mean difference in heart rate from placebo of 22.1 bpm and a mean difference in systolic and diastolic blood pressure from placebo ranging from 5.4 to 7.9 mmHg and 7.9 to 10.6 mmHg, respectively [F3919].The dual ability for milnacipran to inhibit the reuptake of both serotonin (5HT) and norepinephrine (NE) facilitates its treatment of both fibromyalgia and major depressive disorder (MDD).    In particular, it is generally believed that 5HT and NE participate in the modulation of endogenous analgesic mechanisms by way of the descending inhibitory pain pathways in the brain and spinal cord [A175759, A175843, A175846]. Although the specific mechanism of action remains unclear, some studies have proposed that low levels of 5HT may be associated with increased sensitivity to pain - a condition that could subsequently be improved by milnacipran's capacity to enhance the presence of 5HT by inhibiting its reuptake via serotonin transporters at synaptic clefts [A175846, F3937, L5659]. Furthermore, in the CNS it is also generally believed that NE released from descending pathways can mitigate pain sensations via eliciting inhibitory effects on alpha-2A-adrenoceptors on central terminals of primary afferent nociceptors, by direct alpha-2-adrenergic action on pain-relay neurons, and by alpha-1-adrenoceptor-mediated activation of inhibitory interneurons [A175843]. Such NE pain mitigation is consequently also enhanced by milnacipran's ability to enhance the presence of NE by inhibiting its reuptake via norepinephrine transporters at synaptic clefts [F3937].    Concurrently, milnacipran's capacity to inhibit the reuptake of both 5HT and NE also facilitates its treatment of MDD. Given the monoamine hypothesis' assertion that decreased 5HT can be associated with anxiety, obsessions, compulsions, and decreased NE can result in lowered alertness, energy, attention, and general interest in life, it is proposed that milnacipran's basic activities as a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor could assist in treating such symptoms of MDD by increasing the presence of both 5HT and NE in the body by inhibiting their reuptake [A175840]. "
1048,"For the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in premenopausal women. Flibanserin is the first drug to be approved for hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in premenopausal women by the FDA in August 2015. It was originally developed as an antidepressant medication by Boehringer Ingelheim, but showed lack of efficacy in trials and was further developed as a hypoactive sexual disorder drug by Sprout Pharmaceuticals. Flibanserin's mechanism of action is attributed to its high affinity for 5-HTA1 and 5-HTA2 receptors, displaying agonist activity on 5-HTA1 and antagonist on 5-HTA2, resulting in lowering of serotonin in the brain as well as an effect on increasing norepinephrine and dopamine neurotransmitters.Flibansetrin has high affinity for serotonin receptors in the brain: it acts as an agonist on 5-HT1A and an antagonist on 5-HT2A. In vivo, flibanserin binds equally to 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors. However, under higher levels of brain 5-HT (i.e., under stress), flibanserin may occupy 5-HT2A receptors in higher proportion than 5-HT(1A) receptors. It may also moderately antagonize D4 (dopamine) receptors and 5-HT2B and 5-HTB2C. Its action on neurotransmitter receptors may contribute to reduction in serotonin levels and increase in dopamine and norepinephrine levels, all of which may play part in reward processing. "
1049,"For the treatment of serious bacterial infections in hospitalised patients.Ceftobiprole is a cephalosporin antibiotic with activity against methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. It was discovered by Basilea Pharmaceutica and is being developed by Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research and Development. Ceftobiprole is the first cephalosporin to demonstrate clinical efficacy in patients with infections due to methicillin-resistant staphylococci and, if approved by regulatory authorities, is expected to be a useful addition to the armamentarium of agents for the treatment of complicated skin infections and pneumonia.Ceftobiprole, a cephalosporin antibiotic, is active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.Cephalosporins, such as ceftobiprole, are bactericidal and have the same mode of action as other beta-lactam antibiotics (such as penicillins). Cephalosporins disrupt the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer of bacterial cell walls. The peptidoglycan layer is important for cell wall structural integrity, especially in Gram-positive organisms. The final transpeptidation step in the synthesis of the peptidoglycan is facilitated by transpeptidases known as penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). PBPs bind to the D-Ala-D-Ala at the end of muropeptides (peptidoglycan precursors) to crosslink the peptidoglycan. Beta-lactam antibiotics mimic this site and competitively inhibit PBP crosslinking of peptidoglycan."
1050,"For the reduction of blood pressure when when oral antihypertensive therapy is not feasible or not desirable.Clevidipine is a dihydropyridine L-type calcium channel blocker that is selective for vascular smooth muscle and is indicated for blood pressure reduction when oral therapy is not an option.Clevidipine belongs to a well-known class of drugs called dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists. Clevidpine is the first third generation intravenous dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. In vitro studies demonstrated that clevidipine acts by selectively relaxing the smooth muscle cells that line small arteries, resulting in arterial dilation, widening of the artery opening, and without reducing central venous pressure or reducing cardiac output.Possibly by deforming the channel, inhibiting ion-control gating mechanisms, and/or interfering with the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, clevidipine inhibits the influx of extracellular calcium across both the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes. The resultant inhibition of the contractile processes of the myocardial smooth muscle cells leads to dilation of the coronary and systemic arteries and improved oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue."
1051,"Investigated for use/treatment in atherosclerosis, bacterial infection, and peripheral vascular disease.Rifalazil is a derivative of the antibiotic rifamycin. It is being investigated by ActivBiotics for the treatment of various bacterial infections.Rifalazil represents a new generation of ansamycins that contain a unique four-ring structure. Originally rifalazil was developed as a therapeutic agent to replace rifampin as part of a multiple drug regimen in the treatment of tuberculosis. As a result of its superior antimicrobial activity and high intracellular levels, rifalazil has potential to treat indications caused by the intracellular pathogen, Chlamydia trachomatis, which causes non-gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis, often leading to pelvic inflammatory disease. Rifalazil also has potential to treat the related microorganism, Chlamydia pneumoniae, which may be involved in chronic inflammatory processes thought to be partly responsible for atherosclerosis. Due to its favourable antimicrobial spectrum and other positive attributes, rifalazil may also prove valuable in the treatment of gastric ulcer disease, caused by Helicobacter pylori, and antibiotic-associated colitis, the result of toxin production following the growth of Clostridium difficile in the colon. The potential value of rifalazil in the treatment of these indications will be assessed in human clinical trials.The potent antimycobacterial activity of rifalazil is due to inhibition of bacterial RNA polymerase."
1052,"Investigated for use/treatment in leukemia (unspecified).Tamibarotene is a novel synthetic retinoid for acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). Tamibarotene is currently approved in Japan for treatment of recurrent APL, and is undergoing clinical trials in the United States.Tamibarotene is a new synthetic retinoid drug recently approved for relapsed or refractory acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) in Japan. It is a specific agonist for retinoic acid receptor alpha/beta. Compared to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a natural retinoid indicated for a first-line treatment of APL, tamibarotene is chemically more stable and several times more potent as an inducer of differentiation in promyelocytic leukemia cells. In contrast to ATRA, whose plasma concentration declines considerably during daily administration, tamibarotene sustains plasma level probably due to a lower affinity for cellular retinoic acid binding protein. Furthermore, adverse side effects were milder than those of ATRA in clinical trials.Tamibarotene is a specific agonist for retinoic acid receptor alpha/beta with possible binding to retinoid X receptors (RXR)."
1053,"Treatment of acute schizophrenia. Iloperidone is an atypical antipsychotic for the treatment of schizophrenia symptoms. Hoechst Marion Roussel Inc. researched the drug until May 1996. In June 1997 they gave the research rights to Titan Pharmaceuticals, who gave the worldwide development, manufacturing, and marketing rights to Novartis in August 1998. On June 9, 2004, Titan Pharmaceuticals gave the Phase III development rights to Vanda Pharmaceuticals. FDA approved on May 9, 2009.Iloperidone shows high affinity and maximal receptor occupancy for dopamine D2 receptors in the caudate nucleus and putamen of the brains of schizophrenic patients. The improvement in cognition is attributed to iloperidone's high affinity for  α adrenergic receptors. Iloperidone also binds with high affinity to serotonin 5-HT2a and dopamine 3 receptors. Iloperidone binds with moderate affinity to dopamine D4, serotonin 5-HT6 and 5-HT7, and norepinephrine NEα1 receptors. Furthermore, iloperidone binds with weak affinity to serotonin 5-HT1A, dopamine D1, and histamine H1 receptors. Iloperidone is a dopamine D2 and 5-HT2A receptor antagonist and acts as a neuroleptic agent.     "
1054,"Adjuvant treatment of partial-onset seizures. Ezogabine (D23129) is a close structural analog of the centrally acting analgesic flupitrine. It is a neuronal potassium channel opener being developed as a first-in-class antiepileptic drug (AED) and is currently being studied in Phase 3 trials as an adjunctive treatment for partial-onset seizures in adult patients with refractory epilepsy. FDA approved in June 10, 2011 under the name of ezogabine.As compared to other antiepileptic agents, ezogabine is unique in that it selectively activates potassium ion channels Kv 7.2-Kv7.5 and not cardiac Kv 7.1, thereby avoiding cardiac side effects. The antiepileptics, as a drug class, are routinely used in the treatment of a number of disease states in addition to epilepsy. Ezogabine is highly efficacious in a broad-spectrum of in vivo epilepsy and seizure models. A comparison of antiepileptic form activity of ezogabine with that of conventional anticonvulsants in in vitro models suggests that retigabine is especially likely to be useful in the treatment of pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Retigabine clearly attenuates pain-like behaviors in various animal models of neuropathic pain; it may also prove to be useful in treatment of clinical anxiety disorders. Clinical data obtained thus far indicate that retigabine is well tolerated in humans when titrated up to its therapeutic dose range. No tolerance, drug dependence, or withdrawal liability has been reported. Thus, retigabine may prove to be useful in the treatment of a diverse range of disease states in which neuronal hyperexcitability is a common underlying factor.Ezogabine has a novel mechanism of action that involves opening of neuronal Kv7.2-7.5 (formerly KCNQ2-5) voltage activated potassium channels. These channels (primarily Kv7.2/7.3) enable generation of the M-current, a sub-threshold potassium current that serves to stabilize the membrane potential and control neuronal excitability. In addition to acting on potassium ion channels, retigabine also affects GABA neurotransmission in the GABA-A receptor, which is a key inhibitory receptor in the central nervous system and is implicated in epilepsy. Malfunctioning of the GABA-A receptor leads to hyperexcitability in the brain, which causes seizures, making this receptor an important target for antiepileptic therapeutics. Apart from increasing the concentration of GABA in the brain (by either enhancing GABA synthesis or blocking GABA metabolism), retigabine allosterically potentiates GABA-induced current in rat cortical neurons in a concentration-dependent manner. Numerous studies have demonstrated that retigabine is effective in a broad spectrum of in vivo epilepsy and seizure models."
1055,"For the long term, once-daily-dosing maintenance of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema.  Indacaterol is a novel, ultra-long-acting, rapid onset β(2)-adrenoceptor agonist developed for Novartis for the once-daily management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on 30 November 2009 and by the FDA on 1 July 2011. It is marketed in Europe as Onbrez and in America as Arcapta Neohaler. Indacaterol is provided as its maleate salt form. Indacaterol is also a chiral molecule but only the pure R-enantiomer is dispensed.Bronchodilator drugs are the foundation for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The principal inhaled bronchodilator treatments used are β(2) -agonists and anticholinergics, either alone or in combination. Currently available β(2) -agonists are of either short duration and used multiple times/day, or of long duration, which requires twice-daily administration. Indacaterol is considered an ultra-long-acting β(2) -agonist and was recently approved for use in the United States. Its duration of action is approximately 24 hours, allowing for once-daily administration. Furthermore, this chiral compound it is given as the R-enantiomer and acts as a full agonist. Cough was the most commonly reported adverse effect with use of indacaterol. Compared to salmeterol, it has 35% more agonist activity. Cough usually occurred within 15 seconds of inhalation of the drug, lasted around 6 seconds, was not associated with bronchospasm, and did not cause discontinuation of the drug. Otherwise, the drug's safety profile was similar to that of other bronchodilators. [PMID: 22499359]Indacaterol works by stimulating adrenergic beta-2 receptors in the smooth muscle of the airways. This causes relaxation of the muscle, thereby increasing the diameter of the airways, which become constricted in asthma and COPD. It is also long acting due to its high affinity to the lipid raft domains in the airway membrane so it slowly dissociates from the receptors. Indacaterol also has a high intrinsic efficacy so it is also very rapid acting - onset of action occurs within 5 minutes.     The pharmacological effects of beta2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including indacaterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3’, 5’-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic monophosphate). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle. In vitro studies have shown that indacaterol has more than 24-fold greater agonist activity at beta2-receptors compared to beta1-receptors and 20-fold greater agonist activity compared to beta3-receptors. This selectivity profile is similar to formoterol. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown."
1056,"Ancrod is indicated for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), central retinal branch vein thrombosis, pripaism, pulmonary hypertension of embolic origin, embolism after insertion of prosthetic cardiac valves, rethrombosis after thrombolytic therapy, rethrombosis after vascular surgery, and prevention of DVT after repair of a fractured neck of a femur.Ancrod, marketed as Viprinex, is a defibrinogenating agent derived from Malayan pit viper venom. The defribrinogenation of blood results in an anticoagulant effect. Currently, Viprinex®/ancrod is not approved or marketed in any country, but is being investigated as a stroke treatment in worldwide clinical trials. In January 2005, the U.S. FDA granted a 'fast-track status' for investigation of ancrod use in patients suffering from acute ischemic stroke, a life threatening condition caused by the blockage of blood vessels supplying blood and oxygen to portions of the brain, for which phase III trials are currently being conducted.The decreased viscosity is directly attributable to lowered fibrinogen levels and leads to important improvements in blood flow and perfusion of the microcirculation. Ancrod decreases the blood viscosity in affected arteries, leads to less intense pain, improves physical limb mobility, facilitates physical and ergo therapy, and decreases the likelihood of local thrombotic events.Ancrod's anticoagulant effects are through the rapid removal of fibrinogen from the blood within hours following ancrod administration. Ancrod specifically cleaves only the alpha chain of fibrinogen, producing the characteristic fibrinopeptides A, AP and AY, not the B-fibrinopeptide. The resulting fibrin polymers are imperfectly formed and much smaller in size (1 to 2 µm long) than the fibrin polymers produced by the action of thrombin. These ancrod-induced microthrombi are friable, unstable, urea-soluble and have significantly degraded a-chains. They do not cross-link to form thrombi. They are markedly susceptible to digestion by plasmin and are rapidly removed from circulation by either reticuloendothelial phagocytosis or normal fibrinolysis, or both. Blood viscosity is reduced by 30-40%.  Ancrod does not activate plagminogen and does not degrade preformed, fully cross-linked thrombin fibrin. Consequently, unlike fibrinolytic agents, ancrod can be used postoperatively.   Ancrod does not activate Factor XIII, produce platelet aggregation, or release ADP, ATP, potassium, or serotonin from platelets.  "
1057,"Cobimetinib is indicated in combination with [vemurafenib] for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation. As a single agent, cobimetinib is also indicated for the treatment of adult patients with histiocytic neoplasms.[L43717]Cobimetinib is an orally active, potent and highly selective small molecule inhibiting mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MAP2K1 or MEK1), and central components of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signal transduction pathway. It has been approved in Switzerland and the US, in combination with vemurafenib for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma.Cobimetinib is a reversible inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that this agent is effective in inhibiting the growth of tumor cells bearing a BRAF mutation, which has been found to be associated with many tumor types. A threonine-tyrosine kinase and a key component of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway that is frequently activated in human tumors, MEK1 is required for the transmission of growth-promoting signals from numerous receptor tyrosine kinases. Cobimetinib is used in combination with vemurafenib because the clinical benefit of a BRAF inhibitor is limited by intrinsic and acquired resistance. Reactivation of the MAPK pathway is a major contributor to treatment failure in BRAF-mutant melanomas, approximately ~80% of melanoma tumors become BRAF-inhibitor resistant due to reactivation of MAPK signaling. BRAF-inhibitor-resistant tumor cells are sensitive to MEK inhibition, therefore cobimetinib and vemurafenib will result in dual inhibition of BRAF and its downstream target, MEK.[A3298,A3300,A3301]Cobimetinib is a reversible inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2. MEK proteins are upstream regulators of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway, which promotes cellular proliferation. BRAF V600E and K mutations result in constitutive activation of the BRAF pathway which includes MEK1 and MEK2. In mice implanted with tumor cell lines expressing BRAF V600E, cobimetinib inhibited tumor cell growth.[L43717]     Cobimetinib and vemurafenib target two different kinases in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Compared to either drug alone, coadministration of cobimetinib and vemurafenib resulted in increased apoptosis in vitro and reduced tumor growth in mouse implantation models of tumor cell lines harboring BRAF V600E mutations. Cobimetinib also prevented vemurafenib-mediated growth enhancement of a wild-type BRAF tumor cell line in an in vivo mouse implantation model.[L43717]  "
1058,"Indicated as an adjunct for the prevention and treatment of wound sepsis in patients with second- and third-degree burns.Silver sulfadiazine is a sulfa derivative topical antibacterial used primarily on second- and third-degree burns.Silver sulfadiazine has broad antimicrobial activity. It is bactericidal for many gram- negative and gram-positive bacteria as well as being effective against yeast. Silver sulfadiazine is not a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and may be useful in situations where such agents are contraindicated.Studies utilizing radioactive micronized silver sulfadiazine, electron microscopy, and biochemical techniques have revealed that the mechanism of action of silver sulfadiazine on bacteria differs from silver nitrate and sodium sulfadiazine. Silver sulfadiazine acts only on the cell membrane and cell wall to produce its bactericidal effect. A specific mechanism of action has not been determined, but silver sulfadiazine's effectiveness may possibly be from a synergistic interaction, or the action of each component. Silver is a biocide, which binds to a broad range of targets. Silver ions bind to nucleophilic amino acids, as well as sulfhydryl, amino, imidazole, phosphate, and carboxyl groups in proteins, causing protein denaturation and enzyme inhibition.   Silver binds to surface membranes and proteins, causing proton leaks in the membrane, leading to cell death.   Sulfadiazine is a competitive inhibitor of bacterial para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), a substrate of the enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase. The inhibited reaction is necessary in these organisms for the synthesis of folic acid."
1059,"For the control of absence (petit mal) seizures that are refractory to other drugs.Mesuximide (or methsuximide) is an anticonvulsant medication. It is sold by Pfizer under the name Petinutin.Used in the treatment of epilepsy. Methsuximide suppresses the paroxysmal three cycle per second spike and wave activity associated with lapses of consciousness which is common in absence (petit mal) seizures. The frequency of epileptiform attacks is reduced, apparently by depression of the motor cortex and elevation of the threshold of the central nervous system to convulsive stimuli.Binds to T-type voltage sensitive calcium channels. Voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) mediate the entry of calcium ions into excitable cells and are also involved in a variety of calcium-dependent processes, including muscle contraction, hormone or neurotransmitter release, gene expression, cell motility, cell division and cell death. The isoform alpha-1G gives rise to T-type calcium currents. T-type calcium channels belong to the ""low-voltage activated (LVA)"" group and are strongly blocked by mibefradil. A particularity of this type of channels is an opening at quite negative potentials and a voltage-dependent inactivation. T-type channels serve pacemaking functions in both central neurons and cardiac nodal cells and support calcium signaling in secretory cells and vascular smooth muscle. They may also be involved in the modulation of firing patterns of neurons which is important for information processing as well as in cell growth processes."
1060,"Intended for the treatment of congestive heart failure and hyperuricemia.Oxypurinol, an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, is a metabolite of allopurinol.Oxypurinol inhibits the enzyme xanthine oxidase, blocking the conversion of the oxypurines hypoxanthine and xanthine to uric acid. Elevated concentrations of oxypurine and oxypurine inhibition of xanthine oxidase through negative feedback results in a decrease in the concentrations of uric acid in the blood and urine. Oxypurinol also facilitates the incorporation of hypoxanthine and xanthine into DNA and RNA, resulting in further reductions of serum uric acid concentrations."
1061,"For the treatment of reflux oesophagitis and peptic ulcer disease.Ecabet is a prescription eye drop for the treatment of dry eye syndrome. Ecabet represents a new class of molecules that increases the quantity and quality of mucin produced by conjunctival goblet cells and corneal epithelia. Mucin is a glycoprotein component of tear film that lubricates while retarding moisture loss from tear evaporation. Ecabet is currently marketed in Japan as an oral agent for treatment of gastric ulcers and gastritis.Ecabet reduces the survival of H. pylori in the stomach and inhibits pepsin activity in the gastric juice of experimental animals. Here we have investigated the effects of ecabet on some of the factors involved in the dynamics of the mucosal barrier, i.e. pepsins and mucins. Pepsin, acid and Helicobacter pylori are major factors in the pathophysiology of peptic ulcer disease and reflux oesophagitis. Ecabet also acts as an inhibitor of H. pylori NADPH oxidase as well as urease. Inhibition of these enzymes prevents bacterial adhesion to gastric mucosa."
1062,"For use/treatment in neurologic disorders and parkinson's disease as well as moderate-to-severe primary Restless Legs Syndrome.Rotigotine (Neupro) is a non-ergoline dopamine agonist indicated for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) and restless legs syndrome (RLS) in Europe and the United States. It is formulated as a once-daily transdermal patch which provides a slow and constant supply of the drug over the course of 24 hours.    Like other dopamine agonists, rotigotine has been shown to possess antidepressant effects and may be useful in the treatment of depression as well.    Rotigotine was developed by Aderis Pharmaceuticals. In 1998 Aderis licensed worldwide development and commercialization rights to Schwarz Pharma of Germany. It was approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2006 and by the FDA in 2007. However, all Neupro patches in the United States and some of Europe were recalled in 2008 due to delivery mechanism issues. Rotigotine has been authorized as a treatment for RLS since August 2008.Rotigotine is an agonist at all 5 dopamine receptor subtypes (D1-D5) but binds to the D3 receptor with the highest affinity. It is also an antagonist at α-2-adrenergic receptors and an agonist at the 5HT1A receptors. Rotigotine also inhibits dopamine uptake and prolactin secretion. There is no indication of a QT/QTc prolonging effect of Neupro in doses up to 24 mg/24 hours. The effects of Neupro at doses up to 24 mg/24 hours (supratherapeutic doses) on the QT/QTc interval was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo- and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg IV, single dose) parallel-group trial with an overall treatment period of 52 days in male and female patients with advanced-stage Parkinson's disease. Assay sensitivity was confirmed by significant QTc prolongation by moxifloxacin. Rotigotine, a member of the dopamine agonist class of drugs, is delivered continuously through the skin (transdermal) using a silicone-based patch that is replaced every 24 hours. A dopamine agonist works by activating dopamine receptors in the body, mimicking the effect of the neurotransmitter dopamine. The precise mechanism of action of rotigotine as a treatment for Restless Legs Syndrome is unknown but is thought to be related to its ability to stimulate dopamine "
1063,"Vandetanib is currently approved as an alternative to local therapies for both unresectable and disseminated disease. Because Vandetanib can prolong the Q-T interval, it is contraindicated for use in patients with serious cardiac complications such as congenital long QT syndrome and uncompensated heart failure. Vandetanib is an oral once-daily kinase inhibitor of tumour angiogenesis and tumour cell proliferation with the potential for use in a broad range of tumour types.    On April 6 2011, vandetanib was approved by the FDA to treat nonresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic medullary thyroid cancer in adult patients.Mean IC50 of approximately 2.1 μg/mL.ZD-6474 is a potent and selective inhibitor of VEGFR (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor), EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) and RET (REarranged during Transfection) tyrosine kinases.     VEGFR- and EGFR-dependent signalling are both clinically validated pathways in cancer, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). RET activity is important in some types of thyroid cancer, and early data with vandetanib in medullary thyroid cancer has led to orphan-drug designation by the regulatory authorities in the USA and EU.  "
1064,"Investigated for use/treatment in breast disorders (unspecified) and pain (acute or chronic).Iodine is commonly used as an antiseptic for minor cuts and abrasions, preventing infections that may result from contaminated wounds. Additionally, iodine has been studied in the treatment of fibrocystic disease and breast cancer.[A3413,A192153,A192156,A192159]Molecular iodine is known to inhibit the induction and promotion of N-methyl-n-nitrosourea-induced mammary carcinogenesis, to regress 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene-induced breast tumors in rats.It has also been shown to have beneficial effects in fibrocystic human breast disease."
1065,"Telaprevir is a direct acting antiviral medication used as part of combination therapy to treat chronic Hepatitis C, an infectious liver disease caused by infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as Telaprevir. Telaprevir is an inhibitor of NS3/4A, a serine protease enzyme, encoded by HCV genotype 1 [FDA Label]. These enzymes are essential for viral replication and serve to cleave the virally encoded polyprotein into mature proteins like NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B. The barrier for develoment of resistance to NS3/4A inhibitors is lower than that of NS5B inhibitors, another class of DAAs [A19593]. Subtitutions at amino acid positions 155, 156, or 168 are known to confer resistance. The substitutions of the enzyme's catalytic triad consisting of H58, D82, and S139 are also likely to alter the affinity of the drug for NS3/4A or the activity of the enzyme itself. Despite this disadvantage Telaprevir is still effective against HCV when paired with [DB00811], [DB00008], and [DB00022].    Telaprevir, [DB00811], [DB00008], and [DB00022] were used with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 12 weeks of daily administration of the combination therapy followed by 12 or 36 weeks of therapy with [DB00811], [DB00008], and [DB00022]. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626].    Telaprevir was available as a fixed dose product (tradename Incivek) used for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C. Approved in May 2011 by the FDA, Incivek was indicated for the treatment of HCV genotype 1 in combination with [DB00811], [DB00008], and [DB00022] [FDA Label]. Incivek has since been withdrawn from the market.Telaprevir is classified as a direct-acting antiviral (DAA) and prevents viral replication in HCV genotype 1 [FDA Label]. Telaprevir is a NS3/4a protease inhibitor used to inhibit viral HCV replication [FDA Label]. NS3/4a protease is an integral part of viral replication and mediates the cleavage the virally encoded polyprotein to mature proteins (NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B) [FDA Label]. Telaprevir inhibits NS3/4A with an IC50 of 10nM."
1066,"Used as adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures in patients 16 years of age or older.Brivaracetam is a racetam derivative of levetiracetam used in the treatment of partial-onset seizures. Brivaracetam binds SV2A with 20 times higher affinity than levetiracetam [A19184]. It is available under the brand name Briviact made by UCB. Briviact received FDA approval on February 19, 2016 [L760].Brivaracetam binds SV2A with high affinity  [A19184]. SV2A is known to play a role in epileptogenesis through modulation of synaptic GABA release [A19185]. It is thought that brivaracetam exerts its anti-epileptogenic effects through its binding to SV2A. Brivaracetam is also known to inhibit Na+ channels which may also contribute to its anti-epileptogenic action [A19186].The precise mechanism of brivaracetam's anti-epileptogenic activity is unknown."
1067,"Ramucirumab is indicated for the treatment of advanced or metastatic gastric or gastro-esophageal junction adenocarcinoma. Patients who have EGFR or ALK genomic aberrations should also have disease progression following FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations.Lastly, ramucirumab is indicated for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with an alpha-fetoprotein level ≥400 ng/mL and have previously been treated with [sorafenib].[L40938]Ramucirumab is a human monoclonal antibody (IgG1) against vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), a type II trans-membrane tyrosine kinase receptor expressed on endothelial cells. By binding to VEGFR2, ramucirumab prevents binding of its ligands (VEGF-A, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D), thereby preventing VEGF-stimulated receptor phosphorylation and downstream ligand-induced proliferation, permeability, and migration of human endothelial cells. VEGFR stimulation also mediates downstream signalling required for angiogenesis and is postulated to be heavily involved in cancer progression, making it a highly likely drug target. In contrast to other agents directed against VEGFR-2, ramucirumab binds a specific epitope on the extracellular domain of VEGFR-2, thereby blocking all VEGF ligands from binding to it. Ramucirumab is indicated for us in advanced gastric or gastro-esophageal junction adenocarcinoma as a single agent or in combination with paclitaxel after prior fluoropyrimidine- or platinum-containing chemotherapy.Ramucirumab is a human monoclonal antibody (IgG1) against vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), a type II trans-membrane tyrosine kinase receptor expressed on endothelial cells. By binding to VEGFR2, ramucirumab prevents binding of its ligands (VEGF-A, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D), thereby preventing VEGF-stimulated receptor phosphorylation and downstream ligand-induced proliferation, permeability, and migration of human endothelial cells."
1068,"Apremilast is indicated for the treatment of adults with active psoriatic arthritis and adults with oral ulcers associated with Behcet's Disease. In addition, apremilast is indicated for the treatment of plaque psoriasis, of any severity, in adult patients who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy.[L7501]Apremilast, also known as Otezla, is a phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor used to treat various types of symptoms resulting from certain inflammatory autoimmune diseases. It belongs to the same drug class as [Roflumilast] and [Crisaborole].[A181244,L7495] Initially approved in 2014, it is marketed by Celgene.[L7501] In July 2019, apremilast was granted a new FDA approval for the treatment of oral ulcers associated with Behcet's disease, an autoimmune condition that causes recurrent skin, blood vessel, and central nervous system inflammation.[A181216]Apremilast reduces but does not completely inhibit various inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1α, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 MCP-1, MIP-1β, MMP-3, and TNF-α, relieving the symptoms of psoriasis and Behcet's disease, which are caused by an increase in these inflammatory mediators.[A181220,L7498] This drug has also been proven to be effective in relieving the pain associated with oral ulcers in Behcet's disease.[A181244]     Apremilast may cause unwanted weight loss and worsen depression, leading to suicidal thoughts or actions. It is advisable to monitor for symptoms of depression and seek medical attention if they occur, especially in patients with pre-existing depression. The need for apremilast should be carefully assessed along with the risk of worsening depression and suicide. If weight loss occurs, the degree of weight loss should be evaluated, and consideration should be made for the possible discontinuation of apremilast.[L7501]The full mechanism of action of this drug is not fully established, however, it is known that apremilast is an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), which mediates the activity of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a second messenger.[A181217] The inhibition of PDE4 by apremilast leads to increased intracellular cAMP levels.[L7501] An increase in cAMP results in the suppression of inflammation by decreasing the expression of TNF-α, IL-17, IL-23, and other inflammatory mediators. The above inflammatory mediators have been implicated in various psoriatic conditions as well as Behcet's disease, leading to their undesirable inflammatory symptoms such as mouth ulcers, skin lesions, and arthritis.[A181220,L7498,L7501] Apremilast administration leads to a cascade which eventually decreases the levels of the above mediators, relieving inflammatory symptoms."
1069,"Ustekinumab is indicated for the management of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in patients 6 years of age and older who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy.[L9386] In adult patients, it is also indicated for the management of active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) alone or in combination with methotrexate, moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease (CD) and moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis.[L45484]Ustekinumab is a human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 kappa monoclonal antibody directed against interleukin(IL)-12 and IL-23, which are cytokines that are involved in immune and inflammatory responses.[A187349] It was generated via recombinant human IL-12 immunization of human Ig (hu-Ig) transgenic mice.[A187349] It is a targeted biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (bDMARDs) that is used in the management of various inflammatory conditions that involve the activation of IL-12 and IL-23 signalling pathways.In September 2016, ustekinumab was additionally approved for the management of moderate to severe Crohn's disease in selected adult patients. In October 2019, it was also approved by the FDA for use to manage moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adults. Ustekinumab is currently the first and only approved biologic therapy for ulcerative colitis that targets the interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 cytokines.[L9392] The dosing regimen for ustekinumab is based on the patient's weight and there are intravenous and subcutaneous formulations of the drug based on the dosing schedule and condition being treated. Ustekinumab is commonly marketed under the trade name STELARA.    Ustekinumab biosimilars are available in some markets, including Wezlana (ustekinumab-auub) in the US[L49071] and Jamteki (AVT04) in Canada.[L49076]Ustekinumab is a targeted antibody therapy that suppresses immune responses. It acts by reducing the signaling pathways of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-12 and IL-23, which play a role in various inflammatory conditions.[L9386] It downregulates the gene expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as MCP-1, TNF-alpha, IP-10, and IL-8.[L9491] The formation of cytochrome P-450 enzymes may be altered by elevated levels of certain cytokines during chronic inflammation.[L9386] Research shows that there is an inverse relationship between plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines and CYP450 enzyme formation and activity. While ustekinumab may potentially normalize the formation of CYP enzymes and enhance the CYP-mediated metabolism of drugs,[A187481] there were no clinically significant effects on human CYP enzyme activities.[L9386] The steady-state was achieved by 28 weeks after multiple subcutaneous dose administration in adult patients with psoriasis.[L9386]Interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 are heterodimeric cytokines that evoke immune and inflammatory responses, such as natural killer cell activation and CD4+ T-cell differentiation and activation.[L9386] The role of IL-12 and IL-23 were implicated in a variety of chronic inflammatory conditions, such as psoriasis and inflammatory bowel diseases. They modulate lymphocyte function, including T-helper (Th) 1 and Th17 cell subsets,[A187349] as CD4+ T cells can differentiate into T-helper (Th) effector lineages based on the environment. Th cells can further activate the downstream pro-inflammatory mediators and transcription factors such as TNFα and IFNγ that drive innate and adaptive immunity.[A187367]     IL-12 and IL-23 share a common p40 subunit, paired with p35 and p19 subunits of IL-12 and IL-23, respectively.   [A187367] The antigen-binding fragment (Fab) of ustekinumab binds the D1 domain of the p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23 in a 1:1 ratio.[A187367] This prevents IL-12 and IL-23 from binding to the IL-12Rβ1 receptor chain of IL-12 (IL-12Rβ1/β2) and IL-23 (IL-12Rβ1/23R) receptor complexes on the surface of NK and T cells.[A187349] Ustekinumab only binds to IL-12 and IL-23 that are unbound to IL-12Rβ1,[L9491] so it is unlikely to initiate Fc effector functions, such as ADCC or CDC.[A187349] Inhibition of the IL-12/23 signalling pathway leads to profound suppression of both the Th1 and Th17 cell lineage of cytokines and chemokines and their inflammatory pathways.[A187352]"
1070,"Used in HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer patients who have already used taxane and/or trastuzumab for metastatic disease or had their cancer recur within 6 months of adjuvant treatment.    Trastuzumab emtansine, formerly called Trastuzumab-DM1 (T-DM1) is a first-in-class HER2 antibody drug conjugate (ADC) comprised of Genentech's trastuzumab antibody linked to ImmunoGen's cell-killing agent, DM1. T-DM1 combines two strategies-- anti-HER2 activity and targeted intracellular delivery of the potent anti-microtubule agent, DM1 (a maytansine derivative)--to produce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Trastuzumab emtansine is marketed under the brand name Kadcyla and is indicated for use in HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer patients who have already used taxane and/or trastuzumab for metastatic disease or had their cancer recur within 6 months of adjuvant treatment. The FDA label has two precautions. First that trastuzumab emtansine and trastuzumab cannot be interchanged. Second that there is a black box warning of serious side effects such as hepatotoxicity, embryo-fetal toxicity, and cardiac toxicity.Trastuzumab emtansine was evaluated in two Herceptin-responsive and one Herceptin-resistant breast tumor models. In the Herceptin-responsive models, Trastuzumab-DM1 caused complete tumor regression in all mice, whereas Herceptin alone slowed tumor growth. In the Herceptin- resistant model, Herceptin alone had no effect on tumor growth. In contrast, Trastuzumab-DM1 caused >90% tumor reduction in all mice. In this Herceptin- resistant model, tumor regrowth was observed after cessation of Trastuzumab- DM1 treatment, yet regression re-occurred when dosing was resumed. The effect was specific for HER2-positive tumors. Thus the physiological effects of trastuzumab emtansine are cell cycle arrest and cell death by apoptosis. Trastuzumab emtansine is a HER2 antibody-drug conjugate. The antibody portion is trastuzumab, which is humanized anti-HER2 IgG1, and produced in the mammalian Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. The drug portion is DM1, which is a maytansine derivative that inhibits microtubules. These two portions are covalently connected by 4-[N-maleimidomethyl] cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (MCC), which is a stable thioether linker. Together MCC and DM1 are called emtansine and are produced by chemical synthesis.    Trastuzumab emtansine binds to the HER2 receptor’s sub-domain IV and goes into the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Lysosomes degrade trastuzumab emtansine and release DM1. DM1 binds to tubulin in microtubules and inhibits microtubule function producing cell arrest and apoptosis. As well, similar to trastuzumab, in vitro studies have shown that both HER2 receptor signalling inhibition and antibody-dependent cytotoxicity are mediated by trastuzumab emtansine."
1071,"[L40193, L47740, L47745] In Europe and Canada, it is also used in patients with mCRPC who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic after the failure of androgen deprivation therapy for whom chemotherapy is not yet clinically indicated.[L47740, L47745] In Europe, it is used in patients whose disease has progressed on or after a docetaxel-based chemotherapy regimen.[L47740] In Canada, it is used in patients who have received prior chemotherapy containing [docetaxel] after the failure of androgen deprivation therapy.[L46896, L47755] In Canada, this combination product is also used with [prednisolone] and is reserved for patients who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, and in whom chemotherapy is not clinically indicated.[L46896]Abiraterone is a potent, irreversible, and selective inhibitor of 17 αhydroxylase/C17,20-lyase (CYP17), an enzyme expressed in testicular, adrenal, and prostatic tumour tissues, to regulate androgen biosynthesis.[A3811, A260880, L40968] Abiraterone was first approved by the FDA and EMA on April,[A260880] July,[L47745] and September 2011,[A260880] respectively. It is used to treat metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and hormone-sensitive high-risk metastatic prostate cancer.[L40968, L40193, L47740, L47745]    As abiraterone has poor oral bioavailability and is susceptible to hydrolysis by esterases, abiraterone acetate was developed as an orally bioavailable prodrug with enhanced stability and absorption.[A3811, A260835]_In vivo_, abiraterone acetate is rapidly hydrolyzed to abiraterone, which mediates its pharmacological actions.[A3810] Abiraterone decreases serum testosterone and other androgens. A change in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels may be observed.[L40968]17α-hydroxylase/C17,20-lyase (CYP17) is a key enzyme in androgen biosynthesis. It is primarily expressed in testicular, adrenal, and prostatic tumours. CYP17 catalyzes the 17α-hydroxylation of pregnenolone and progesterone to their 17α-hydroxy derivative, followed by subsequent cleavage of the C 20,21-acetyl group to yield dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione. DHEA and androstenedione are precursors of testosterone.[A260870, L40968] Aberrant androgen levels and unregulated androgen receptor signalling have been implicated in the development and progression of various prostate cancers.[A260875] Androgen-sensitive prostatic carcinoma responds to treatment that decreases androgen levels. Androgen deprivation therapies, such as treatment with GnRH agonists or orchiectomy, decrease androgen production in the testes but do not affect androgen production by the adrenals or in the tumour.[A3810, L40968]    Abiraterone inhibits CYP17 to block androgen production. Inhibition of CYP17 can also result in increased mineralocorticoid production by the adrenals.[L40968] "
1072,"Obeticholic acid is indicated for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA. It is also used as a monotherapy in adults with PBC that are unable to tolerate UDCA.[L12633]    Obeticholic acid is currently being considered for FDA approval to treat fibrosis caused by non-alcoholic liver steatohepatitis (NASH), and is likely to be approved for this indication in 2020.[L12636]Primary biliary cirrhosis, or PBC, is a progressive and chronic condition that leads to hepatic injury often resulting in end-stage liver failure that requires liver transplantation.[A192786]    Obeticholic acid is a farnesoid-X receptor (FXR) agonist used to treat this condition, possibly allowing for increased survival.[A18696]  In 2016, it was granted approval to treat primary biliary cholangitis in combination with [ursodeoxycholic acid], which was previously the mainstay treatment for this condition.[A18696,L12633] In May 2021, the FDA updated its prescribing information to contraindicate the use of obeticholic acid in patients with PBC and advanced cirrhosis (e.g. those with portal hypertension or hepatic decompensation) due to a risk of liver failure, in some cases requiring liver transplantation.[L34650]     Obeticholic acid is currently being considered for FDA approval to treat fibrosis caused by non-alcoholic liver steatohepatitis (NASH). The NDA from Intercept Pharmaceuticals was approved in November 2019 and obeticholic acid is expected to be granted full approval for this indication in 2020.[L12636]The activation of the FXR by obeticholic acid acts to reduce the synthesis of bile acids, inflammation, and the resulting hepatic fibrosis. This may increase the survival of patients with PBC, but to date, an association between obeticholic acid and survival in PBC has not been established.[A192786,L12633]      Primary biliary cirrhosis is an autoimmune process by which the bile ducts and liver are damaged progressively, leading to fibrosis and cirrhosis. Bile acids increase the risk of damage and fibrosis to the damaged bile ducts.[A192786,A192795]      Obeticholic acid is a potent agonist of the farnesoid X receptor, which serves to regulate the hepatic metabolism of bile and cholesterol. This drug acts by binding to the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), found in the nucleus of liver and intestinal cells, which in turn increases liver bile flow, suppressing its production and decreasing hepatocyte exposure to excess levels of bile with cholestasis. Cholestasis is a process that normally causes inflammation and cirrhosis of the liver.[A192792,L12633]"
1073,"Investigated for use/treatment in solid tumors.Aldoxorubicin, an antineoplastic agents, is an albumin-binding prodrug of doxorubicin.INNO-206 is the (6-Maleimidocaproyl) hydrazone of doxorubicin. INNO-206 is a prodrug of doxorubicin that binds endogenous albumin after administration. The bound doxorubicin is released in the acidic environment of the tumor cell through cleavage of an acid sensitive linker. In preclinical models, INNO-206 was superior to doxorubicin with regard to antitumor efficacy and toxicity."
1074,"Cariprazine is indicated for the treatment of **schizophrenia** in adults to manage both positive and negative symptoms. It is also indicated to monotherapy for acute management of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (**bipolar mania**) in adults, and acute management of depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (**bipolar depression**) in adults.[L43307,L40198]Cariprazine is an atypical antipsychotic agent and a piperazine derivative that was first developed in Hungary.[A247100] It works as a partial agonist at central dopamine D2, dopamine D3, and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors and as an antagonist at serotonin 5-HT2A receptors.[L40198]  Cariprazine has been investigated in a variety of psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, and major depressive disorder. Cariprazine gained its first global approval in the US in September 2015 [A3941] and was later approved by Health Canada in April 2022.[L41670] It is currently used to treat schizophrenia, and manic or mixed episodes and depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder.[L41655,L40198]Cariprazine is an antipsychotic agent. In clinical trials, it reduced positive and negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and acute mania in patients with bipolar I disorder. In animal models, cariprazine showed therapeutic benefits against cognitive deficits, mania, and catalepsy.[A3941] In a meta-analysis study, cariprazine was shown to improve anxiety and depressed mood in patients with psychosis.[A247055]    As cariprazine is a partial agonist at dopamine D2 and D3 receptors, it produces an apparent lower blockade level than other antipsychotic agents that block dopamine receptors. This receptor binding profile is advantageous as dopamine receptor blockade is associated with extrapyramidal symptoms as side effects. Partial agonism would allow the dopamine receptor to be stimulated even at maximal receptor occupancy by the drug.[A247100] Antagonism at 5-HT1A [A247100] and 5-HT2A receptors by cariprazine can increase dopaminergic neurotransmission in the nigrostriatal pathway, thereby further reducing the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms.[A247055] However, cariprazine is still associated with a risk of akathisia, extrapyramidal disorder, restlessness, and tremor.[A3941,L40198] While recent research points to the involvement of multiple neurotransmitters in the development and maintenance of schizophrenia and bipolar disorders, the dopamine hypothesis has been and continues to be a key theory in understanding the pathophysiology of these psychiatric disorders. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays several important roles in cells, and most importantly, it is a crucial neurotransmitter involved in reward processing and motivation. The nigrostriatal, mesolimbic, and mesocortical systems consist of dopaminergic projections. The dopamine hypothesis states that dopaminergic Aberrations are observed in schizophrenia and bipolar disorders.[A189156,A247105] For example, hyperactive dopamine D2 receptor activity has been associated with positive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hallucinations and delusions. On the other hand, alterations in dopamine D3 receptors may be involved in producing negative symptoms of schizophrenia.[A189156] It was stated that hyperdopaminergia, caused by elevations in D2/3 receptor availability and a hyperactive reward processing network, underlies the development of mania in bipolar disorder.[A247105]    The exact mechanism of action of cariprazine is not fully elucidated. Cariprazine potently binds to both of these receptors, more preferably to D3 receptors with higher affinity.[A3941] Preclinical studies suggest that D3 receptor blockade is associated with exerting pro-cognitive and antidepressant effects and attenuating negative symptoms in schizophrenia.[A247095] This unique mechanism of action differs from that of other antipsychotic agents that mostly target D2 and 5-HT2A receptors.[A247055] Cariprazine is also a partial agonist at 5-HT1A receptors, an antagonist at 5-HT2B and 5-HT2A receptors, an antagonist at histamine H1 receptors. It also binds to 5-HT2C, alpha (α)-1A adrenergic, and alpha (α)-1B adrenergic receptors with low affinity.[A3941,A247095] "
1075,"Olaratumab (IMC-3G3) is a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody with antitumor activity that selectively binds the external domain of human platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-α with high affinity and blocks ligand binding. It is composed of two heavy chain molecule fragments and 2 light chain fragments.Olaratumab was granted accelerated approval (as Lartruvo) as initial therapy to treat adults with certain types of soft tissue sarcoma (STS) in October, 2016. It exerts an anti-tumor activity in vivo and in vitro against selected sarcoma cells by inhibiting tumor growth by binding to PDGFR-alpha that is present on several types of cancer on transformed cells and in tumor stroma [A18695]. Olaratumab antibody binding leads to inhibition of ligand-dependent signaling in PDGFR(alpha)-expressing tumor cells, as well as stromal cells in the tumor microenviroment that are dependent on PDGFR(alpha) signaling. Olaratumab blocks ligand-induced tumor cell proliferation, and inhibits receptor autophosphorylation and ligand-induced phosphorylation of the downstream signaling molecules protein kinase B (Akt) and mitogen-activated protein kinase [A19171]. PDGFR signalling is a type of tyrosine kinase-mediated pathway that normally regulates cell growth, chemotaxis, and mesenchymal stem cell differentiation. It also promotes internalization of PDGFR thus alters the surface levels of PDGFR. "
1076,"Used in the treatment of schizophrenia.Sertindole, a neuroleptic, is one of the newer antipsychotic medications available. Serdolect is developed by the Danish pharmaceutical company H. Lundbeck. It is a phenylindole derivative used in the treatment of schizophrenia. It was first marketed in 1996 in several European countries before being withdrawn two years later because of numerous cardiac adverse effects. It has once again been approved and should soon be available on the French and Australian market.Sertindole is an atypical antipsychotic at least as effective as haloperidol and risperidone in the treatment of neuroleptic-responsive schizophrenia. Sertindole improves negative symptoms, and is also effective for the treatment of neuroleptic-resistant schizophrenia. Sertindole is generally well tolerated and is associated with a low rate of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).Sertindole is an antipsychotic drug with affinity for dopamine D2, serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C, and alpha1-adrenoreceptors. Preclinical studies suggest that sertindole acts preferentially on limbic and cortical dopaminergic neurons and clinical trials have confirmed that sertindole is effective at a low dopamine D2 occupancy level.

1077,"Sulfathiazole is effective against a wide range of gram positive and gram negative pathogenic microorganisms. Although no longer used in humans, it is used in cattle.Sulfathiazole is a short-acting sulfa drug. It used to be a common oral and topical antimicrobial until less toxic alternatives were discovered. Except for those formulated for vaginal use, the FDA withdrew its approval for the use of all drug products containing sulfathiazole.[L43942]"
1078,"For the treatment of bacterial infections caused by susceptible microorganisms.Teicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic consisting of a mixture of several compounds, five major (named teicoplanin A2-1 through A2-5) and four minor (named teicoplanin RS-1 through RS-4). All teicoplanins share a same glycopeptide core, teicoplanin A3-1, but differ in the length and conformation of side chains attached to their β-D-glucosamine moiety.It is a glycopeptide antiobiotic extracted from Actinoplanes teichomyceticus, with a similar spectrum of activity to vancomycin. Its mechanism of action is to inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis. Oral teicoplanin has been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of pseudomembranous colitis and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea, with comparable efficacy to vancomycin.Teicoplanin inhibits peptidoglycan polymerization, resulting in inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis and cell death."
1079,"For use in the treatment of infections.Sulfadimethoxine is a sulfonamide antibiotic. Sulfadimethoxine is used to treat many infections, including treatment of respiratory, urinary tract, enteric, and soft tissue infections. It is most frequently used in veterinary medicine, although it is approved in some countries for use in humans. Sulfadimethoxine inhibits bacterial synthesis of folic acid (pteroylglutamic acid) from para-aminobenzoic acid. Sulfadimethoxine is approved in Russia for use in humans, including children, and has been successfully used there for more than 35 years. It is widely available in Russia as an over-the-counter drug manufactured by a number of Russian pharmaceutical companies.    In the US, sulfadimethoxine is one of the products that have been withdrawn or removed from the market after being found to be unsafe or not effective.[L43942]Sulfadimethoxine has been shown to be effective against streptococci, klebsiella, proteus, shigella, staphylococci, escherichia, and salmonella."
1080,"Used for the treatment of angina pectoris [L2393].Pentaerythritol tetranitrate is the nitrate ester of pentaerythritol that possesses explosive properties. When mixed with a plasticizer, this chemical forms a plastic explosive. It is recognized by the FDA to be a coronary vasodilator in the treatment of heart conditions such as angina [L2395].    It is a pentaerythritol nitrate in which all four hydroxy groups of pentaerythritol have been converted to the corresponding nitrate ester. It is a vasodilator with properties that are quite similar to those of glyceryl trinitrate, however, with a more prolonged duration of action. It is also one of the most powerful high explosives known and is a component of the plastic explosive known as Semtex [L2393].    PETN has the chemical formula C5H8N4O12. It is formed by reacting pentaerythritol (C5H12O4), an alcohol commonly used in paints and varnishes, with nitric acid (HNO2). The reacting solution is chilled to precipitate the PETN.  It is then filtered out, washed, dried, and recrystallized to produce a colorless crystalline material that is stored and shipped as a mixture with water and alcohol [L2394].    Interestingly, this drug was studied for potential benefits in chronic ischemic heart failure patients.  PETN targeting reactive oxygen species generation halted the changes of mitochondrial antioxidant enzymes and progressive fibrotic remodeling, leading to amelioration of cardiac functional performance in rats with ischemic heart failure [A32649].Organic nitrate which causes systemic vasodilation, decreasing cardiovascular preload [L2413].    Nitrate enters vascular smooth muscle and converted to nitric oxide (NO) which acts as a cellular messenger, leading to activation of cyclic GMP and, therefore, vasodilation [L2413].    The nitrovasodilator group of drugs relaxes most smooth muscles in the body, including those in the walls of arteries and veins, and selectively dilate large coronary vessels [L2398]. Lower doses of nitrates increase coronary blood flow without significantly affecting systemic arterial pressure. Higher doses, especially if repeated frequently, decrease systolic and diastolic blood pressure as well as cardiac output, which can result in a headache, weakness, dizziness, and the activation of compensatory sympathetic reflexes, including tachycardia and peripheral arteriolar vasoconstriction [A32651].    Smooth muscles in the bronchi, biliary tract, gastrointestinal tract, ureters, and uterus also can be relaxed by nitrovasodilators. PETN seems to be unique among the long-acting nitrovasodilators in that patients do not demonstrate  tolerance to treatment, which results in sustained vasodilation in humans with continuous PETN treatment [L2412].    Important to note is that this drug is devoid of induction of oxidative stress and related side-effects such as endothelial dysfunction or tolerance to nitrates. Some of these effects are related to special pharmacokinetics of PETN, but upon chronic administration, PETN also induces antioxidative pathways at the genomic level, resulting in increased expression of heme _oxygenase-1 (HO-1)_ _and ferritin_, both possessing highly protective properties. There is good experimental evidence that at least part of the beneficial profile of long-term treatment with this drug is based on the activation of the _heme oxygenase-1/ferritin_ system [L2414].  Pentaerythritol tetranitrate is the lipid soluble polyol ester of nitric acid belonging to the family of _nitro-vasodilators_. Pentaerythritol tetranitrate releases free nitric oxide (NO) after the denitration reaction, which triggers NO-dependent signaling transduction involving soluble _guanylate cyclase (sGC_). Nitric oxide binds reversibly to the ferrous-heme center of sGC, causing conformational change and activating the enzyme. This enzyme activation results in increased cellular concentrations of _cyclic guanosine monophosphate _(cGMP) within the vascular smooth muscle, resulting in vasodilation mediated by cGMP-dependent protein kinases. Additionally, this agent causes dose-dependent arterial and venous bed [L2393]."
1081,"For use in conjunction with diet and exercise for patients with a body mass index greater than 30 kg/m2, or patients wih a BMI greater than 27 kg/m2 with associated risk factors, such as type 2 diabetes or dyslipidaemia.Rimonabant is an anorectic anti-obesity drug produced and marketed by Sanofi-Aventis. It is an inverse agonist for the cannabinoid receptor CB1. Its main avenue of effect is reduction in appetite. Rimonabant is the first selective CB1 receptor blocker to be approved for use anywhere in the world. Rimonabant is approved in 38 countries including the E.U., Mexico, and Brazil. It was rejected for approval for use in the United States. This decision was made after a U.S. advisory panel recommended the medicine not be approved because it may increase suicidal thinking and depression.In the RIO-North America trial, 3040 patients were randomized to receive either placebo or one of two doses of rimonabant (5 mg or 20 mg per day). Patients taking 20 mg rimonabant had significant weigh loss, decrease in waist circumference, improved insulin sensitivity, and increases in HDL cholesterol, compared to patients on placebo.Rimonabant is a specific CB1 cannabinoid receptor antagonist. There is considerable evidence that the endocannabinoid (endogenous cannabinoid) system plays a significant role in appetitive drive and associated behaviours. It is therefore reasonable to hypothesize that the attenuation of the activity of this system would have therapeutic benefit in treating disorders that might have a component of excess appetitive drive or over-activity of the endocannabinoid system, such as obesity, ethanol and other drug abuse, and a variety of central nervous system and other disorders."
1082,"Canakinumab is indicated for the treatment of periodic fever syndromes in specific patient populations. In patients ≥4 years of age, canakinumab is indicated for the treatment of Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS), including Familial Cold Auto-inflammatory Syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS). In adult and pediatric patients, canakinumab is also indicated for the treatment of Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS), Hyperimmunoglobulin D Syndrome (HIDS)/Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency (MKD), and Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF).[L48006]    Canakinumab is additionally indicated in patients ≥2 years of age for the treatment of active Still's disease, including Adult-Onset Still's Disease (AOSD) and Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (SJIA).[L48006]    Canakinumab is also indicated for the treatment of gout flares in adult patients in whom standard therapies (e.g. NSAIDs, colchicine) are contraindicated, not tolerated, or ineffective, and in whom repeated courses of corticosteroids are not appropriate.[L48006]Canakinumab is a recombinant, human anti-human-IL-1β monoclonal antibody that belongs to the IgG1/κ isotype subclass. It is expressed in a murine Sp2/0-Ag14 cell line and comprised of two 447- (or 448-) residue heavy chains and two 214-residue light chains, with a molecular mass of 145157 Daltons when deglycosylated. Both heavy chains of canakinumab contain oligosaccharide chains linked to the protein backbone at asparagine 298 (Asn 298). Canakinumab binds to human IL-1β and neutralizes its inflammatory activity by blocking its interaction with IL-1 receptors, but it does not bind IL-1alpha or IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra). Canakinumab is marketed under the brand name Ilaris and indicated for patients 4 years of age and older to treat Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS), which are both part of the Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS) as well as for patients 2 years of age and older to treat systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA). Clinical trials have established the administration of canakinumab every 2 weeks to be safe and effective, offering a considerable advantage over the existing treatment with the human IL-1 receptor antagonist, anakinra, which must be injected daily and which is often poorly tolerated by patients.Canakinumab neutralizes the activity of human IL-1β, which is involved in several inflammatory disorders. Canakinumab has promising clinical safety and pharmacokinetic properties, and demonstrated potential for the treatment of cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA), and possibly for other complex inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, COPD disease and ocular diseases. In inflammatory diseases involving Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) is excessively activated and drives inflammation.[L48006] The protein cryopyrin controls the activation of IL-1β, and mutations in cryopyrin's gene, NLRP-3, up-regulate IL-1β activation. Canakinumab binds to human IL-1β and neutralizes its inflammatory activity by blocking its interaction with IL-1 receptors, but it does not bind IL-1α or IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra).[L48006]    "
1083,"Romidepsin is indicated for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) in adult patients who have received at least one prior systemic therapy.[L39925]Romidepsin is a selective inhibitor of histone deacetylase, approved in the US in 2009 for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) in patients who have received at least one prior systemic therapy.Romidepsin is a prodrug, where it becomes active once taken up into the cell. The active metabolite has a free thiol group, which interacts with zinc ions in the active site of class 1 and 2 HDAC enzymes, resulting in inhibition of its enzymatic activity. Certain tumors have over expressed HDACs and downregulated/mutated histone acetyltransferases. This imbalance of HDAC relative to histone acetyltransferase can lead to a decrease in regulatory genes, ensuing tumorigenesis. Inhibition of HDAC may restore normal gene expression in cancer cells and result in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. "

1086,"Indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Alogliptin is a selective, orally-bioavailable inhibitor of enzymatic activity of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4). Chemically, alogliptin is prepared as a benzoate salt and exists predominantly as the R-enantiomer (>99%). It undergoes little or no chiral conversion in vivo to the (S)-enantiomer. FDA approved January 25, 2013.Peak inhibition of DPP-4 occurs within 2-3 hours after a single-dose administration to healthy subjects. The peak inhibition of DPP-4 exceeded 93% across doses of 12.5 mg to 800 mg. Inhibition of DPP-4 remained above 80% at 24 hours for doses greater than or equal to 25 mg.  Alogliptin also demonstrated decreases in postprandial glucagon while increasing postprandial active GLP-1 levels compared to placebo over an 8-hour period following a standardized meal. Alogliptin does not affect the QTc interval. Alogliptin inhibits dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4), which normally degrades the incretins glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon like peptide 1 ( GLP-1). The inhibition of DPP-4 increases the amount of active plasma incretins which helps with glycemic control. GIP and GLP-1 stimulate glucose dependent secretion of insulin in pancreatic beta cells. GLP-1 has the additional effects of suppressing glucose dependent glucagon secretion, inducing satiety, reducing food intake, and reducing gastric emptying."
1087,"Tapentadol is indicated for the management of acute pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. Due to the risks of addiction, drug abuse, and drug misuse, tapentadol is reserved for patients for whom alternative treatment options are unavailable.[L47286, L47516, L47521]    The immediate-release tapentadol oral tablets are approved for use in patients six years and older with a body weight of at least 40 kg.[L47286] Tapentadol oral solution is used in patients aged six years and older with a body weight of at least 16 kg.[L47521] These formulations are not intended for long-term use unless the pain remains severe enough to require an opioid analgesic, for which alternative treatment options remain inadequate.    The extended-release tablets of tapentadol are indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. They are also indicated for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) in adults severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. This formulation is not indicated as an as-needed (prn) analgesic.[L47516]Tapentadol is a centrally-acting synthetic analgesic with a dual mechanism of action. It is a mu-opioid receptor agonist that also inhibits norepinephrine reuptake.[A260721, A36596]    Tapentadol was first approved by the FDA on November 20, 2008. The extended-release formulation of tapentadol was also approved by the FDA on August 26, 2011.[L47291] Used in the management of pain, tapentadol is typically reserved for patients who have limited alternative treatment options.Tapentadol is an opioid agonist that exerts physiological effects commonly caused by the opioid drug class. These effects include miosis, reduced gastrointestinal motility, and peripheral vasodilation. Tapentadol produces respiratory depression by reducing the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation.[L47286]    Tapentadol has a high potential for misuse and abuse, which can lead to the development of substance use disorder. Abuse of tapentadol poses a risk of overdose and death, which increases with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants.[L47286]Tapentadol is a centrally-acting synthetic analgesic. Although their clinical relevance is unclear, tapentadol is believed to have two main mechanisms of action.[L47286] Tapentadol is a selective mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist: it binds to MOR with an affinity greater than or equal to ten-fold affinity compared to delta- and kappa-opioid receptors.[A36596] Tapentadol also inhibits noradrenaline reuptake, thereby increasing noradrenaline levels and activating alpha-2 receptors to promote analgesia.[A36596, A260731] Tapentadol is a weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor; however, this action does not contribute to its analgesic effect.[A36596]"
1088,"Sugammadex is indicated for the reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by [rocuronium] bromide or [vecuronium] bromide in adults and pediatric patients ≥2 years old who are undergoing surgery.[L15766]Sugammadex is a selective relaxant binding agent indicated for reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium bromide and vecuronium bromide during surgery. Rocuronium bromide and vecuronium bromide are neuromuscular blocking medications that cause temporary paralysis and are especially useful for general anesthesia, ventilation, or tracheal intubation that patients may require for surgery. Sugammadex provides a new treatment option to reverse the effects of those medications and possibly help patients recover sooner post-surgery. Sugammadex (brand name Bridion) is marketed by Merck Sharp and Dohme, and was approved by the United States FDA on December 15, 2015.Sugammadex is a modified gamma-cyclodextrin which forms very tight water soluble complexes at a 1:1 ratio with steroidal neuromuscular blocking drugs (rocuronium > vecuronium >> pancuronium). Sugammadex creates a concentration gradient which favors movement of rocurionium from the neuromuscular junction into the plasma, which quickly reverses rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade. The free rocuronium  in the plasma are then bound tightly to sugammadex, assisting the diffusion of the remaining rocuronium molecules out of the neuromuscular junction and increasing bound and free rocuronium in the plasma."
1089,"Silodosin is indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). It is not indicated for the treatment of hypertension. Silodosin is a selective antagonist of alpha(α)-1 adrenergic receptors that binds to the α1A subtype with the highest affinity. α1-adrenergic receptors regulate smooth muscle tone in the bladder neck, prostate, and prostatic urethra: the α1A subtype accounts for approximately 75% of α1-adrenoceptors in the prostate. Silodosin was first approved by the FDA in October 2008 and it is also approved in Europe and Canada. Silodosin is available as oral capsules with common trade names Rapaflo and Urorec. It is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia in adults. Most commonly affecting males over the age of 40 years, benign prostatic hyperplasia is the non-malignant enlargement of the prostate gland, associated with lower urinary tract symptoms that have a negative impact on the quality of life of patients. Silodosin works by binding to α1A-adrenoceptors with high affinity and relaxing the lower urinary tract, thereby improving urinary symptoms and alleviating bladder outlet obstruction. Silodosin is an antagonist of α1-adrenoceptors. It has the highest selectivity for the α1A-adrenoceptor subtype, with a 162-fold greater affinity than α1B-adrenoceptor and about a 50-fold greater affinity than for α1D-adrenoceptor. In clinical trials, silodosin improved maximum urinary flow rate, voiding symptoms, and storage symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Following oral administration, silodosin had a rapid onset of effect in men, with early effects of relieving lower urinary tract symptoms occurring within two to six hours post-dose. Silodosin inhibited the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) tail current; however, it has weak cardiovascular effects. As with all α1-adrenoceptor antagonists blocking α1-adrenoceptors in the iris dilator muscle, silodosin may cause intraoperative floppy iris syndrome (IFIS), which is characterized by small pupils and iris billowing during cataract surgery in patients taking α1-AR antagonists. The pathogenesis of benign prostatic hyperplasia is not fully understood: it is believed to involve several pathways, including inflammation, apoptosis, and cellular proliferation. Most drug therapies aim to alleviate symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia, silodosin included. Lower urinary tract symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia are categorized into three main groups: voiding or obstructive (hesitancy, slow stream, intermittency, incomplete emptying), storage or irritative (frequency, urgency, nocturia, urge urinary incontinence), and postmicturition (postvoid dribbling). Prostate contraction is the main contributor to lower urinary tract symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. The smooth muscle tone of the prostate is regulated by α1A-adrenoceptors, which are the most highly expressed subtype of α1adrenoceptors in the human prostate tissue. It has been reported that blockade of α1A-adrenoceptors relieves bladder outlet obstruction. Blockade of α1D-adrenoceptors, another subtype found in prostate tissue, is believed to alleviate storage symptoms due to detrusor overactivity. α1-adrenoceptors are G protein-coupled receptors: upon binding of its natural ligand, norepinephrine and epinephrine, leads to the activation of phospholipase C and downstream signalling molecules, including inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol. Ultimately, there is an increase in intracellular calcium levels and, consequently, smooth muscle contraction. Silodosin is an antagonist of α1-adrenoceptors, with the highest selectivity for the α1A-adrenoceptor subtype. By blocking the α1A-adrenoceptor signalling pathway, silodosin promotes prostatic and urethral smooth muscle relaxation, thereby improving lower urinary tract symptoms such as voiding. Silodosin also targets afferent nerves in the bladder, relieving bladder overactivity and storage symptoms."
1090,"Indicated in combination with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) to prevent atherothrombotic events in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) who are to be managed with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). May be used in patients with unstable angina (UA), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who are to be managed with PCI. Prasugrel is not recommended in patients 75 years of age or greater, those that weigh<60kg, and patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack due to increased risk of fatal and intracranial bleeding. Prasugrel, a thienopyridine derivative, is a platelet activation and aggregation inhibitor structurally and pharmacologically related to clopidogrel and ticlopidine. Similar to clopidogrel, prasugrel is a prodrug that requires enzymatic transformation in the liver to its active metabolite, R-138727. R-138727 irreversibly binds to P2Y12 type ADP receptors on platelets thus preventing activation of the GPIIb/IIIa receptor complex. As a result, inhibition of ADP-mediated platelet activation and aggregation occurs. Prasugrel was developed by Daiichi Sankyo Co. and is currently marketed in the United States and Canada in cooperation with Eli Lilly and Company for acute coronary syndromes planned for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). FDA approved in 2009.Prasugrel is a thienopyridine ADP receptor inhibitors which inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversibly binding to P2Y12 receptors.Prasugrel is an thienopyridine and a prodrug which inhibits ADP receptors by irreversibly acting on the P2Y12 receptor on platelets. The active metabolite of prasugrel prevents binding of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to its platelet receptor, impairing the ADP-mediated activation of the glycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa complex. Prasugrel is proposed to have a similar mechanism of action to clopidogrel."
1091,"Thrombopoietin receptor agonists are pharmaceutical agents that stimulate platelet production in the bone marrow. In this, they differ from the previously discussed agents that act by attempting to curtail platelet destruction. Eltrombopag is used to treat low blood platelet counts in adults with chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenia (ITP), when certain other medicines, or surgery to remove the spleen, have not worked well enough. ITP is a condition that may cause unusual bruising or bleeding due to an abnormally low number of platelets in the blood. Eltrombopag has also been recently approved (late 2012) for the treatment of thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet counts) in patients with chronic hepatitis C to allow them to initiate and maintain interferon-based therapy.Eltrombopag is an orally bioavailable, small-molecule TPO-receptor agonist that interacts with the transmembrane domain of the human TPO-receptor. Eltrombopag is a stimulator of STAT and JAK phosphorylation. Unlike recombinant TPO or romiplostim, Eltrombopag does not activate the AKT pathway in any way. It should be noted that when given to patients with aplastic anemia, other lineages besides platelet count were increased, suggesting that either eltrombopag enhanced the effect of TPO in vivo; or there is a yet uncovered mechanism of action at work. "
1092,"Doripenem is indicated in the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections and complicated urinary tract infections, including pyelonephritis, caused by designated susceptible bacteria.   Doripenem is a broad-spectrum, carbapenem antibiotic marketed under the brand name Doribax by Janssen. Doripenem injection was approved by the FDA in 2007 to treat complicated urinary tract and intra-abdominal infections. In a clinical trial of doripenem treatment in ventilator associated pneumonia (vs. imipenem and cilastatin), it was found that doripenem carried an increased risk of death and lower clinical cure rates, resulting in a premature termination of the trial. The FDA revised the doripenem label in 2014 to include a warning against use in ventilator-associated pneumonia and to reiterate its safety and efficacy for its approved indications.Similar to other beta-lactam antimicrobial agents, the time that unbound plasma concentration of doripenem exceeds the MIC (T>MIC) of the infecting organism has been shown to best correlate with efficacy in animal models of infection.Doripenem is a broad-spectrum carbapenem antibiotic with activity against many gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic bacteria, as well as a variety of anaerobes. Like other beta-lactam antibiotics, doripenem's bactericidal mechanism of action is mostly due to cell death after inhibition of bacterial enzymes called penicillin-bindng proteins (PBPs), which are responsible for peptidoglycan cross-linking during the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall. Carbapenems mainly have high affinity for PBPs 1a, 1b, 2 and 3. Inhibition of each PBP usually results in a different inactivating mechanism. Inhibition of PBPs 1a and 1b results in fast bacterial killing through the formation of spheroplasts, inhibition of PBP 2 results in rod-shaped bacteria to become spherical, and inhibition of PBP 3 results in filamentous-shaped organisms. The PBPs preferentially bound by different carbapenems depend on the organism. In E.coli and P.aeruginosa, doripenem binds to PBP  2, which is involved in the maintenance of cell shape, as well as to PBPs 3 and 4. Doripenem has a 1-beta-methyl side chain, which allows it to be relatively resistant to dehydropeptidase, as well as a trans-alpha-1-hydroxyethyl group at position 6 which provides beta-lactamase resistance. Like other carbapenems, doripenem is different from most beta-lactams due to its stability against hydrolysis by most beta-lactamases, including penicillinases, cephalosporinases, ESBL, and Amp-C producing enterobacteriaceae."
1093,"Treatment of symptomatic and resistant to fluid restriction euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia associated with congestive heart failure, SIADH, and cirrhosis. Tolvaptan is used to treat low blood sodium levels (hyponatremia) associated with various conditions like congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormones (SIADH). FDA approved on May 19, 2009.Urine volume and fluid intake increase in a dose dependent manner which results in overall negative fluid balance in patients taking tolvaptan. Increases in serum sodium and osmolality can be observed 4-8 hours post-administration and is maintained for 24 hours. The magnitude of serum sodium and osmolality change increases with escalating doses. Furthermore, a decrease in urine osmolality and increase in free water clearance can be observed 4 hours after post-administration of tolvaptan. The affinity for V2 receptors is 29x greater than that of V1a receptors and does not have any appreciable affinity for V2 receptors. Tolvaptan is a selective and competitive arginine vasopressin receptor 2 antagonist. Vasopressin acts on the V2 receptors found in the walls of the vasculature and luminal membranes of renal collecting ducts. By blocking V2 receptors in the renal collecting ducts, aquaporins do not insert themselves into the walls thus preventing water absorption. This action ultimately results in an increase in urine volume, decrease urine osmolality, and increase electrolyte-free water clearance to reduce intravascular volume and an increase serum sodium levels. Tolvaptan is especially useful for heart failure patients as they have higher serum levels of vasopressin. "
1094,"Used for treatment in psychosis, schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders, manic disorders, and bipolar disorders as monotherapy or in combination.Developed by Schering-Plough after its merger with Organon International, asenapine is a sublingually administered, atypical antipsychotic for treatment of schizophrenia and acute mania associated with bipolar disorder. Asenapine also belongs to the dibenzo-oxepino pyrrole class. It is also for severe post-traumatic stress disorder nightmares in soldiers as an off-label use. FDA approved on August 13, 2009.Asenapine is a serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline, and histamine antagonist in which asenapine possess more potent activity with serotonin receptors than dopamine. Sedation in patients is associated with asenapine's antagonist activity at histamine receptors. Its lower incidence of extrapyramidal effects are associated with the upregulation of D1 receptors. This upregulation occurs due to asenapine's dose-dependent effects on glutamate transmission in the brain. It does not have any significant activity with muscarinic, cholinergic receptors therefore symptoms associated with anticholinergic drug activity like dry mouth or constipation are not expected to be observed.  Asenapine has a higher affinity for all aforementioned receptors compared to first-generation and second-generation antipsychotics except for 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors. Asenapine is an atypical antipsychotic multireceptor neuroleptic drug which shows strong 5HT2A (serotonin) and D2 (dopamine) receptor antagonism, which has been shown to enhance dopamine (DA) and acetylcholine (Ach) efflux in rat brains. Asenapine may improve cognitive function and negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. "
1095,"Indicated for the rapid conversion of recent onset of atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm in adults for non-surgery patients that lasts for less than 7 days of duration and post-cardiac surgery patients with atrial fibrillation lasting less than 3 days of duration.Vernakalant was developed by Cardiome Pharma as as an antiarrhythmic drug intended for rapid conversion of atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. It acts as an atypical class III antiarrhythmic drug that potentiates its effect in higher heart rates. Intravenous formulation was approved in Europe in September 2010 as Brinavess and in Canada in April 2017. It is an investigational drug under regulatory review by FDA.Vernakalant blocks currents in all phases of atrial action potential including atria-specific potassium currents (the ultra-rapid delayed rectifier and the acetylcholine dependent potassium currents)  and prolongs the refractory period. It dose-dependently prolongs atrial refractoriness, prolongs AV nodal conduction and refractoriness, and slightly prolongs QRS duration without significantly affecting ventricular refractory period. Vernakalant has a high affinity to ion channels specifically involved in repolarization of atrial tissue and is thought to have a low proarrhythmic potential.Vernakalant blocks atrial voltage-gated sodium channels in a dose and frequency-dependent manner and inhibits late sodium current (INa)which confers its effect on intra-atrial conduction. This current blockade enhance and onset of drug action accelerates in higher heart rate as the affinity of vernakalant for INa also increases. Its binding offset is quick once the heart rate slows [A19198]. It also blocks Kv 1.5 channel and its early activating potassium channels (IKur) and inhibits acetylcholine-activated potassium channels (IKAch), which are specific to the atrium and cause prolongation of atrial refractoriness. Vernakalant also blocks Kv4.3 channel and its cardiac transient outward potassium current (Ito), which is involved more with atrial than ventricular refractoriness [A19203].   Vernakalant minimally blocks hERG channels and its rapidly activating/delayed rectifying potassium current (IKr) which accounts for mild QT prolongation. QRS widening due to INa blockade also contributes to QT prolongation [A19197]. "
1096,"In the US and Europe, lacosamide is indicated for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in children and adults.[L49191, L49196, L49201] In Canada, it is reserved for use in adults.[L49206]    It is also used as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients four years of age and older.[L49191, L49201]    The extended-release capsules of lacosamide are indicated for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in adults and in pediatric patients weighing at least 50 kg.[L49196]Lacosamide is an antiepileptic drug used to treat seizures. As a chiral functionalized amino acid, it works by blocking slowly inactivating components of voltage-gated sodium currents. Lacosamide exhibits a stereoselective mode of interaction with sodium channels.[A262681] Lacosamide was first approved by the European Commission in August 2008 and was later approved by the FDA in October 2008.[A262681] It was granted approval by Health Canada in September 2010.[L49206]Lacosamide is an antiepileptic drug with high oral potency, stereoselectivity,[A262686] and anticonvulsant effects.[A262616] By blocking sensory neuronal voltage-gated sodium channels that mediate neuropathic pain responses, lacosamide was shown to possess analgesic activity.[A4071, A262616] Lacosamide is a chiral functionalized amino acid. The S-stereoisomer does not exhibit antiepileptic activity.[A262616]Caused by neuronal hyperexcitability, seizures in epilepsy involve sustained firing of sodium-dependent action potentials. The slow inactivation process, intrinsic to voltage-gated sodium channel functioning, has been implicated in the paroxysmal depolarizing shifts associated with epileptic activity.[A262616] The exact mechanism of action of lacosamide is not fully known; however, in vitro electrophysiological studies have shown that lacosamide selectively enhances the slow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels, shifting the slow inactivation curve to more hyperpolarized potentials and augmenting the maximal fraction of channels in the slow inactivated state.[A262686] This results in the stabilization of hyperexcitable neuronal membranes and inhibition of repetitive neuronal firing.[A262616, L49191] Lacosamide does not affect the fast component of voltage-gated sodium currents, unlike traditional sodium channel blockers.[A262616]"
1097,"Dalbavancin for injection is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI), caused by susceptible isolates of the following gram-positive microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus anginosus group (including Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus constellatus) and Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin susceptible strains) [FDA Label, F2356].    Dalbavancin is not active against gram-negative bacteria; therefore, combination therapy may be clinically indicated if the ABSSSI is polymicrobial and includes a suspected or documented gram-negative pathogen [F2356].    To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of dalbavancin and other antibacterial drugs, dalbavancin should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria [FDA Label, F2356]. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy [FDA Label, F2356]. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy [FDA Label, F2356].   Dalbavancin is a second-generation lipoglycopeptide antibiotic that was designed to improve on the natural glycopeptides currently available, such as vancomycin and teicoplanin [A4072, A4073]. Modifications from these older glycoprotein classes facilitated a similar mechanism of action for dalbavancin but with increased activity and once-weekly dosing [FDA Label, F2356, A4072, A4073]. Its use is indicated for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) caused by the following gram-positive microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant strains), S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae, the S. anginosus group (including S. anginosus, S. intermedius, and S. constellatus), and Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin susceptible strains) [FDA Label, F2356]. Dalbavancin acts by interfering with bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to the D-alanyl-D-alanine terminus of nascent cell wall peptidoglycan and preventing cross-linking [FDA Label, F2356, A4072, A4073].The antibacterial activity of dalbavancin appears to best correlate with the ratio of area under the concentration-time curve to minimal inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC) for Staphylococcus aureus based on animal models of infection [FDA Label, F2356]. An exposure-response analysis of a single study in patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections supports the two-dose regimen for which dalbavancin injection is administered [FDA Label, F2356].    Subsequently, the recommended dosage regimen of dalbavancin in patients with normal renal function is 1500 mg, administered either as a single dose, or 1000 mg followed one week later by 500 mg [FDA Label, F2356. Dalbavancin should be administered over 30 minutes by intravenous infusion [FDA Label, F2356].    Furthermore, inn a randomized, positive- and placebo-controlled, thorough QT/QTc study, 200 healthy subjects received either dalbavancin 1000 mg intravenous (IV), dalbavancin 1500 mg IV, oral moxifloxacin 400 mg, or placebo. Neither dalbavancin 1000 mg nor dalbavancin 1500 mg had any clinically relevant adverse effect on cardiac repolarization [FDA Label, F2356]. Dalbavancin has a spectrum and mechanism of action similar to vancomycin, a naturally formed glycopeptide antimicrobial [A4073]. The bactericidal action of dalbavancin results primarily from inhibition of cell-wall biosynthesis [FDA Label, F2356, A4072, A4073, A4074]. Specifically, dalbavancin prevents incorporation of N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM)- and N-acetylglucosamine (NAG)-peptide subunits from being incorporated into the peptidoglycan matrix; which forms the major structural component of Gram-positive cell walls [A4072, A4073]. The large hydrophilic molecule is able to form hydrogen bond interactions with the terminal D-alanyl-D-alanine moieties of the NAM/NAG-peptides, which is normally a five-point interaction [FDA Label, A4072, A4073]. Binding of dalbavancin to the D-Ala-D-Ala prevents the incorporation of the NAM/NAG-peptide subunits into the peptidoglycan matrix [FDA Label, A4072, A4073]. In addition, dalbavancin alters bacterial-cell-membrane permeability and RNA synthesis. "
1098,"Rivaroxaban is indicated for the prevention of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) in patients who have undergone total hips replacements and total knee replacement surgery; prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation; treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE); to reduce risk of recurrent DVT and/or PE. Rivaroxaban is also indicated, in combination with aspirin, for reducing the risk of major cardiovascular events in patients with chronic coronary artery disease or peripheral artery disease. Its use is also not recommended in those with severe renal impairment (<30mL/min).[L12819]    Rivaroxaban is also indicated for the treatment and prevention of VTE in pediatric patients (from birth to 18 years of age) and for thromboprophylaxis in pediatric patients ≥2 years old with congenital heart disease following the Fontan procedure.[L12819]  Rivaroxaban is an anticoagulant and the first orally active direct factor Xa inhibitor. Unlike warfarin, routine lab monitoring of INR is not necessary. However there is no antidote available in the event of a major bleed. Only the 10 mg tablet can be taken without regard to food. The 15 mg and 20 mg tablet should be taken with food. FDA approved on July 1, 2011.Rivaroxaban is an anticoagulant which binds directly to factor Xa. Thereafter, it effectively blocks the amplification of the coagulation cascade, preventing the formation of thrombus. Rivaroxaban is a unqiue anticoagulant for two reasons. First of all, it is does not involve antithrombin III (ATIII) to exert its anticoagulant effects. Secondly, it is an oral agent whereas the widely used unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparins are for parenteral use only. Although the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and HepTest (a test developed to assay low molecular weight heparins) are prolonged in a dose-dependant manner, neither test is recommended for the assessment of the pharmacodynamic effects of rivaroxaban. Anti-Xa activity and inhibition of anti-Xa activity monitoring is also not recommended despite being influenced by rivaroxaban.Rivaroxaban competitively inhibits free and clot bound factor Xa. Factor Xa is needed to activate prothrombin (factor II) to thrombin (factor IIa). Thrombin is a serine protease that is required to activate fibrinogen to fibrin, which is the loose meshwork that completes the clotting process. Since one molecule of factor Xa can generate more than 1000 molecules of thrombin, selective inhibitors of factor Xa are profoundly useful in terminating the amplification of thrombin generation. The action of rivaroxaban is irreversible.     "
1099,"Avanafil is indicated for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.[L32058]Avanafil is a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor used in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. In comparison with other drugs of the same class, it shows greater selectivity for PDE5 over PDE6 than both [sildenafil] and [vardenafil] but less selectivity than [tadalafil], suggesting a relatively lower risk of visual disturbances associated with off-target PDE6 inhibition.[L32113]    It first received FDA approval on April 27, 2012,[L32058] with subsequent EMA approval in June 2013.[L32113]Avanafil is a strong competitive inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) with a demonstrated _in vitro_ IC<sub>50</sub> of 5.2 nM.[L32113] Its inhibitory effects on PDE5 are 100-fold more potent than on PDE6 and >1000-fold more potent than on other PDE enzymes,[L32058] meaning it is less likely to cause visual disturbances and cardiovascular adverse effects when compared with less selective PDE5 inhibitors such as [sildenafil] and [vardenafil].[L32113] It has a relatively quick onset of action allowing for administration as early as 15 minutes prior to sexual activity.[L32058]    PDE5 inhibitors like avanafil can cause significant drug interactions when administered alongside certain antihypertensive agents (e.g. alpha blockers, substantial amounts of alcohol).[L32058] PDE5 inhibitors have also been associated with the development of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a rare condition that typically presents as sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes and appears to be more common in patients with a ""crowded"" optic disc. Patients presenting with any degree of vision loss should immediately discontinue use of all PDE5 inhibitors and seek medical attention.[L32058] In some jurisdictions, a history of NAION or other degenerative retinal disorders is considered a contraindication to avanafil therapy.[L32233]Avanafil inhibits the cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) which is responsible for the degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum located around the penis. Sexual arousal results in the local release of nitric oxide, which in turn stimulates the enzyme guanylate cyclase to produce cGMP. Elevated levels of cGMP result in local smooth muscle relaxation and increased blood flow to the penis (i.e. an erection).[L32058,L32113]    As PDE5 inhibitors like avanafil require the endogenous release of nitric oxide in order to exert their pharmacologic effect, they have no effect on the user in the absence of sexual stimulation/arousal.[L32058,L32113]"
1100,"Eflornithine is indicated to reduce the risk of relapse in adult and pediatric patients with high-risk neuroblastoma (HRNB) who have demonstrated at least a partial response to prior multiagent, multimodality therapy including anti-GD2 immunotherapy.[L49288]  It was also previously indicated for the treatment of female hirsutism and African trypanosomiasis but has since been discontinued.[L49318]Eflornithine is an irreversible ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor originally developed as a treatment for human African trypanosomiasis.[A262829] Further research has also implicated ornithine decarboxylase in other conditions like facial hirsutism and cancer, especially when ornithine decarboxylase is highly upregulated in tumor cells.[A4112, A262834] Additionally, ornithine decarboxylase is activated by c-myc or interacts with ras, both very well-known oncogenes, thus increasing the interest in targeting ornithine carboxylase as a potential cancer treatment.[A262839]    In 1960 and 2000, the FDA approved eflornithine under the brand names ORNIDYL and VANIQUA for the treatment of African trypanosomiasis and hirsutism, respectively, but has since been discontinued.[A262823,L49318] Subsequently, on December 14, 2023, the FDA approved eflornithine again but under the brand name IWILFIN as an oral maintenance therapy to reduce the risk of relapse in adult and pediatric patients with high-risk neuroblastoma who have demonstrated at least a partial response to prior multiagent, multimodality therapy, including anti-GD2 immunotherapy. This approval is based on positive results obtained from a multi-site, single-arm, externally controlled study of children with high-risk neuroblastoma, where a 52% reduction in the risk of relapse and a 68% reduction in the risk of death were observed.[L49313]Inhibition of polyamine synthesis by eflornithine restored the balance of the LIN28/Let-7 metabolic pathway, which is involved in the regulation of cancer stem cells and glycolytic metabolism, by decreasing expression of the oncogenic drivers MYCN and LIN28B in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma. In vitro, eflornithine induced senescence and suppressed neurosphere formation in MYCN-amplified and MYCN non-amplified neuroblastoma cells, indicating a cytostatic effect. Treatment with eflornithine prevented or delayed tumor formation in mice injected with limiting dilutions of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells.[L49288]    Additionally, polyamines are also involved in keratin synthesis, and inhibition of polyamines can decrease the proliferation of hair matrix cells and thus inhibit the anagen phase of hair production.[A4113]    Eflornithine is an irreversible inhibitor of the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of polyamines and a transcriptional target of MYCN. Polyamines are involved in the differentiation and proliferation of mammalian cells and are important for neoplastic transformation.[L49288] "
1101,"For treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (NOH) associated with various disorders including Multiple System Atrophy, Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy, hemodialysis induced hypotension and Parkinson's Disease. Also investigated for use/treatment in neurologic disorders, nephropathy, blood (blood forming organ disorders, unspecified), and dizzy/fainting spells.Droxidopa is a precursor of noradrenaline that is used in the treatment of Parkinsonism. It is approved for use in Japan and is currently in trials in the U.S. The racaemic form (dl-threo-3,4-dihydroxyphenylserine) has also been used, and has been investigated in the treatment of orthostatic hypotension. There is a deficit of noradrenaline as well as of dopamine in Parkinson's disease and it has been proposed that this underlies the sudden transient freezing seen usually in advanced disease.    Though L-DOPS has been used in Japan and Southeast Asia already for some time, it is also currently in clinical trials at the phase III point in the United States (U.S.), Canada, Australia, and throughout Europe. Provided L-DOPS successfully completes clinical trials, it could be approved for the treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (NOH) as early as 2011. Additionally, phase II clinical trials for intradialytic hypotension are also underway. Chelsea Therapeutics obtained orphan drug status (ODS) for L-DOPS in the U.S. for NOH, and that of which associated with Parkinson's disease , pure autonomic failure, and multiple system atrophy, and is the pharmaceutical company developing it in that country.Droxidopa is an orally active synthetic precursor of norepinephrine that increases the deficient supply of norepinephrine in patients with NOH, thereby improving orthostatic blood pressure and alleviating associated symptoms of lightheadedness, dizziness, blurred vision, and syncope through the induction of tachycardia (increased heart rate) and hypertension.Droxidopa crosses the blood-brain barrier where it is converted to norepinephrine via decarboxylation by L-aromatic-amino-acid decarboxylase. Norephinephrine acts at alpha-adrenergic receptors as a vasoconstrictor and at beta-adrenergic receptors as a heart stimulator and artery dilator."
1102,"Investigated for use/treatment in neurologic disorders, spinal cord injuries, muscle spasm, back pain, and multiple sclerosis.Tolperisone is an oral, centrally acting muscle relaxant. Its precise mechanism is not completely understood, though it blocks sodium and calcium channels. It possesses a high affinity for nervous system tissue, reaching highest concentrations in brain stem, spinal cord and peripheral nerves. Based on existing clinical data, Tolperisone is not sedating and does not interact with alcohol."
1103,"Investigated for use/treatment in benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostate disorders, and cancer/tumors (unspecified).Lonidamine (LND) is a drug that interferes with energy metabolism of cancer cells, principally inhibiting aerobic glycolytic activity, by its effect on mitochondrially-bound hexokinase (HK). In such way LND could impair energy-requiring processes, as recovery from potentially lethal damage, induced by radiation treatment and by some cytotoxic drugs.Lonidamine is an orally administered small molecule that inhibits glycolysis by the inactivation of hexokinase. Hexokinase is an enzyme that catalyzes glucose, the first step in glycolysis. The inhibition of hexokinase by lonidamine is well established. In addition, there is evidence that lonidamine may increase programmed cell death. This stems from the observation that mitochondria and mitochondria-bound hexokinase are crucial for induction of apoptosis; agents that directly effect mitochondria may, therefore, trigger apoptosis. Indeed, in vitro models with lonidamine exhibit the hallmarks of apoptosis, including mitochondrial membrane depolarization, release of cytochrome C, phosphatidylserine externalization, and DNA fragmentation. "
1104,"Investigated for use/treatment in erectile dysfunction and hypertension.Udenafil is a new phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED). It has been approved in South Korea and will be marketed under the brand name Zydena. It is not yet approved for use in the U.S., E.U., or Canada.Udenafil is a potent selective phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor.Udenafil inhibits the cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum located around the penis. Penile erection during sexual stimulation is caused by increased penile blood flow resulting from the relaxation of penile arteries and corpus cavernosal smooth muscle. This response is mediated by the release of nitric oxide (NO) from nerve terminals and endothelial cells, which stimulates the synthesis of cGMP in smooth muscle cells. Cyclic GMP causes smooth muscle relaxation and increased blood flow into the corpus cavernosum. The inhibition of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) by udenafil enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cGMP."
1105,"Investigated for use/treatment in pulmonary hypertension, connective tissue diseases, hypertension, and congestive heart failure.Sitaxentan was marketed under the trade name Thelin for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) by Encysive Pharmaceuticals until Pfizer purchased Encysive in February 2008. In 2010, Pfizer voluntarily removed sitaxentan from the market over concerns of hepatotoxicity.Sitaxentan belongs to a class of drugs known as endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs). Patients with PAH have elevated levels of endothelin, a potent blood vessel constrictor, in their plasma and lung tissue. Sitaxentan blocks the binding of endothelin to its receptors, thereby negating endothelin's deleterious effects.Sitaxentan is a competitive antagonist of endothelin-1 at the endothelin-A (ET-A) and endothelin-B (ET-B) receptors. Under normal conditions, endothelin-1 binding of ET-A or ET-B receptors causes pulmonary vasoconstriction. By blocking this interaction, Sitaxentan decreases pulmonary vascular resistance. Sitaxentan has a higher affinity for ET-A than ET-B."
1106,"Sulodexide has been used clinically for the prophylaxis and treatment of vascular diseases with increased risk of thrombosis, including intermittent claudication, peripheral arterial occlusive disease and post-myocardial infarc-tion. Also investigated in the treatment of diabetic kidney disease and diabetic neuropathy. New anti-inflammatory properties have also extended its use in venous disease.Sulodexide is a mixture of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) composed of dermatan sulfate (DS) and fast moving heparin (FMH).Sulodexide is extensively absorbed owing to its low molecular weight compared to unfractionated heparin. It offers the potential advantages of a longer half-life and reduced global anticoagulation effects, properties which differ from other glycosaminoglycans. Sulodexide potentiates antithrombin III and heparin cofactor II due to the presence of both glycoaminoglycan fractions. It is capable of inhibiting both anti-IIa and anti-Xa. It promotes fibrinolytic activity by releasing tissue plasminogen activator and reduces plasminogen activator inhibitor. The drug also blocks platelet adhesion and platelet function induced by cathepsin G and thrombin. Research has also shown that Sulodexide had endothelial protective properties by inducing the overexpression of growth factors important for the protection of organs. It has anti-inflammatory properties via its effect on the release of inflammatory mediators from macrophages. This results in anti-proliferative effects such as the regulation of growth factors like VEGF and FGF.   The intravenous administration has also been shown capable of releasing tissue factor pathway inhibitor from the endothelium, which also contributes to the anti-thrombotic effects of Sulodexide. Lastly, this drug is known for its ability to inhibit the secretion of MMPs, particularly MMP-9, from leukocytes in a dose dependent manner, resulting in the restoration of the balance with their tissue inhibitors.Thrombin inhibition produced by sulodexide is due to the additive effect of its components, namely, heparin cofactor II (HCII) catalysis by dermatan sulfate  and antithrombin-III catalysis by fast moving heparin (FMH)."
1107,"Tocilizumab is indicated to treat moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, giant cell arteritis, systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and cytokine release syndrome.[L12789, L43697, L48385]    Tocilizumab is also used to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adults who are receiving systemic corticosteroids and require supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).[L40169,L43697,L44483]Tocilizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody IL-6 receptor inhibitor used to treat inflammatory and autoimmune conditions.[L12789] It was first described in the literature in 2003 when Chugai, a subsidiary of Roche began developing IL-6 inhibiting monoclonal antibodies.[A193281] Tocilizumab was granted FDA approval on 8 January 2010 to treat a number of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, such as different types of arthritis and cytokine release syndrome.[L12789] It was later approved by Health Canada on 30 April 2010.[L43697] After being investigated to treat severely ill patients with COVID-19,[A193278,L12837,L12843] tocilizumab was approved by the European Commission in December 2021 to treat COVID-19 in adults receiving systemic corticosteroids and supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation.[L40164] Subsequently, it was granted approval by Health Canada and the FDA in October [L43697] and December 2022, respectively.[L44483] Tocilizumab-bavi, a biosimilar drug, was approved by the FDA in September 2023.[L48385]Tocilizumab is an IL-6 inhibiting monoclonal antibody used to treat autoimmune and inflammatory conditions.[L12789] Tocilizumab has a long duration of action as it is generally given every 4 weeks and has a wide therapeutic index.[L12789] Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of infections, GI perforation, and hepatotoxicity.[L12789]Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by cells including T-cells, B-cells, lymphocytes, monocytes, fibroblasts.[L12789] IL-6 rapidly induces C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, fibrinogen, haptoglobin, and α-1-antichymotrypsin while inhibiting production of fibronectin, albumin, and transferrin.[A193287] IL-6 also induces antibody production, induces cytotoxic T-cell differentiation, and inhibits regulatory T-cell differentiation.[A193287] Tocilizumab binds soluble and membrane bound IL-6 receptors, preventing IL-6 mediated inflammation.[L12789]"

Also investigated for use in the treatment of pain (acute or chronic).Alvimopan is a peripherally acting μ opioid antagonist. It is used to avoid postoperative ileus following small or large bowel resection and accelerates the gastrointestinal recovery period.Alvimopan competitively binds to mu-opioid receptor in the gastrointestinal tract but, unlike methylnaltrexone which relies upon it ionic charge, alvimopan owes its selectivity for peripheral receptors to its pharmacokinetics. Alvimopan binds to peripheral mu-receptors with a Ki of 0.2 ng/mL."

1110,"Ziconotide is indicated for the management of severe chronic pain in patients refractory to other treatments, and for whom intrathecal therapy is warranted.[L13389]Ziconotide (also known as SNX-111) is a neurotoxic peptide derived from the cone snail _Conus magus_ comprising 25 amino acids with three disulphide bonds.[A202835, L13389] Other such peptides, collectively termed conotoxins, exist, and some have shown efficacy in binding specific subsets of calcium channels; ziconotide is used in part because it can be synthesized without loss of proper bond formation or structural elements.[A202829, A202832] Ziconotide is used to manage severe chronic pain refractory to other methods, through its ability to inhibit N-type calcium channels involved in nociceptive signalling.[A202829, A202835, A202838, A202841, A202850, A202859, L13389]    Ziconotide was granted FDA approval on December 28, 2004 for marketing by TerSera therapeutics LLC. under the name Prialt.[L13389] To date, ziconotide is the only calcium channel blocking peptide approved for use by the FDA.[A202835]Ziconotide inhibits N-type calcium channels involved in nociceptive signalling, primarily in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.[A202829, A202835, A202838, A202841, A202850, A202859, L13389] Although binding is reversible, careful dosing is required to ensure therapeutic effects while minimizing adverse effects, and ziconotide has been described as possessing a narrow therapeutic window.[A202853, L13389] Patients taking ziconontide may experience cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms, reduced levels of consciousness, and elevated serum creatine kinase levels. In addition, ziconotide may increase the risk of infection, including serious cases of meningitis. Patients who withdraw from opiates for ziconotide initiation are advised to taper off the dose.[L13389]Nociceptive pain signalling is a complex processing pathway involving peripheral nociceptors, primary afferent nerve fibres, and downstream CNS neurons located in the spinal cord.[A202838, A202859] Voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) are important regulatory components of neural signalling and include the N-type (Cav2.2) heteromultimeric high-voltage type calcium channels.[A202844] Chronic pain conditions, including inflammatory and neuropathic pain, often involve the aberrant upregulation of VGCC activity through various cellular mechanisms, which can lead to allodynia and hyperalgesia.[A202859]    Specifically, N-type channel activation in lightly myelinated Aδ- and C-fibres is known to mediate the release of neurotransmitters substance P (SP), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and glutamate, which influence downstream neural activation and pain perception.[A202838, A202859, A202868, A202871, A202874] In addition, SP and CGRP induce inflammation, potentially exacerbating pre-existing inflammatory chronic pain.[A202859]    Ziconotide belongs to the ω-conotoxin class of neurotoxic peptides derived from the cone snail _Conus magus_ which are capable of inhibiting N-type VGCCs.[A202826, A202829, A202835, A202841, L13389] Although the exact mechanism is yet to be elucidated, it is thought that ω-conotoxins function through direct occlusion of the ion pore to prevent calcium translocation across the membrane.[A202841] Additional studies involving expression of chimeric subunits and molecular modelling suggest that insertion of the ziconotide Met12residue into a hydrophobic pocket formed by Ile300, Phe302, and Leu305 of Cav2.2 increases binding and may be associated with toxic adverse effects.[A202847]"
1111,"Teriparatide is indicated:    - for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture (defined herein as having a history of osteoporotic fracture or multiple risk factors for fracture) or who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy. In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, teriparatide reduces the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures.[L42590, L42595, L46178, L46183]  - to increase bone mass in men with primary or hypogonadal osteoporosis at high risk for fracture or who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.[L42590, L42595, L46178, L46183]  - for the treatment of men and women with osteoporosis associated with sustained systemic glucocorticoid therapy (daily dosage equivalent to 5 mg or greater of prednisone) at high risk for fracture or who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.[L42590, L42595, L46178, L46183]Teriparatide is a recombinant parathyroid hormone (PTH) analog and a potent osteoanabolic agent.[A251395] It is made up of the first amino(N)-terminal 34 amino acids of the human PTH.[A251395] First approved in the United States in November 2002 and in Europe in April 2003,[A251400] teriparatide makes the first approved drug in a new category of osteoporosis therapy called anabolic therapy.[A251395] Teriparatide is used in the treatment of osteoporosis in men and women.[L42590, L42595]Teriparatide is a PTH analog that works to stimulate bone formation in both men and women. It increases skeletal mass, increases markers of bone formation such as bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP) and procollagen I carboxy-terminal propeptide (PICP), and increases bone strength.[L42590]     Like endogenous PTH, teriparatide affects calcium and phosphate homeostasis. It causes a transient increase in serum calcium levels and increases urinary calcium excretion. In clinical trials, it also produced transient phosphaturia and mild transient reductions in serum phosphorus concentration.[L42590]Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is an endogenous hormone that regulates calcium and phosphate metabolism in bone and kidney. It regulates bone metabolism, renal tubular reabsorption of calcium and phosphate, and intestinal calcium absorption. It mediates its physiological actions by binding to the PTH receptors.[L42590] Excess PTH - such as in certain disease states like hyperparathyroidism - can cause increased osteoclast activity and accelerated bone resorption. Interestingly, the effects of PTH depend on the dose and pattern of exposure of PTH to the bone. Continuous exposure to PTH promotes bone resorption, whereas intermittent exposure to low-dose PTH can induce bone formation more favourably than bone resorption.[A251395]    Similarly, teriparatide's skeletal effects depend upon the systemic exposure pattern. Once-daily administration of teriparatide stimulates new bone formation on trabecular and cortical (periosteal and/or endosteal) bone surfaces by preferential stimulation of osteoblastic activity over osteoclastic activity.[L42590] Teriparatide mediates its osteoanabolic actions by binding to the N-terminal moiety to PTH type 1 receptors (PTH type 1R), which are G-protein coupled receptors expressed on various cells, including osteoblasts, osteocytes, and renal tubular cells.[A251395] Binding of teriparatide to PTH receptors on osteoblasts activates the downstream PKA- and PKC-dependent signaling pathways that promotes anabolic effects on bone.[A6748, A251395] For example, teriparatide increases expression of pro-osteoclastogenic cytokines like receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor. It also upregulates transcriptional expression of pro-osteoblastogenic growth factors like insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2). Teriparatide also downregulates the synthesis of sclerostin, which is a negative regulator of bone formation. It also promotes the differentiation of osteoblasts.[A251395]"
1112,"For the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Also investigated for use/treatment in breast cancer, lymphoma (unspecified), rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple myeloma.Temsirolimus is a derivative of sirolimus used in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). It was developed by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals under the trade name Torisel. Temsirolimus was approved by the FDA in late May 2007 as well as the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) on November 2007.Temsirolimus is an inhibitor of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). Temsirolimus binds to an intracellular protein (FKBP-12), and the protein-drug complex inhibits the activity of mTOR that controls cell division. Inhibition of mTOR activity resulted in a G1 growth arrest in treated tumor cells. When mTOR was inhibited, its ability to phosphorylate p70S6k and S6 ribosomal protein, which are downstream of mTOR in the PI3 kinase/AKT pathway was blocked. In in vitro studies using renal cell carcinoma cell lines, temsirolimus inhibited the activity of mTOR and resulted in reduced levels of the hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1 and HIF-2 alpha, and the vascular endothelial growth factor."
1113,"[L32759]    Oral amisulpride is indicated for the treatment of acute and chronic schizophrenic disorders, characterized by positive symptoms with delusions, hallucinations, thought disorders, hostility and suspicious behavior; or primarily negative symptoms (deficit syndrome) with blunted affect, emotional and social withdrawal. Amisulpride also controls secondary negative symptoms in productive conditions as well as affective disorders such as depressive mood or retardation.[L32764]Amisulpride is a benzamide derivative and a dopamine receptor antagonist that selectively works on dopamine D2 and D3 receptors. As an antipsychotic agent, amisulpride alleviates both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and it exhibits antidepressant properties in patients with psychiatric disorders, dysthymia, and major depression.[A6755] Amisulpride predominantly works in the limbic system, which explains its relatively lower risk of extrapyramidal adverse effects compared to other atypical antipsychotic agents.[A6752, L32764] Oral tablets of amisulpride is used in European countries as a treatment for acute and chronic schizophrenic disorders, as well as secondary negative symptoms in mental health disorders such as affective disorders, depressive mood, and mental retardation.[L32764]    Amisulpride is also used as an antiemetic agent.L32759] It is marketed under the brand name Barhemsys.Amisulpride is a selective dopamine D2 and D3 receptor antagonist with no affinity towards other dopamine receptor subtypes. Amisulpride is an atypical antipsychotic agent that works as an antagonist at dopamine receptors in the limbic system. Since it works preferentially in the limbic system, amisulpride is less likely to be associated with extrapyramidal adverse effects than other atypical antipsychotic agents. Amisulpride has no affinity for serotonin, alpha-adrenergic, H1-histamine, cholinergic, and sigma receptors. In clinical trials, amisulpride improved reduced secondary negative symptoms, affective symptoms, and psychomotor retardation in patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. Notably, amisulpride has a differential target binding profile at different doses: at low doses, amisulpride selectively binds to presynaptic dopamine autoreceptors. At high doses, it preferentially binds to post-synaptic dopamine receptors.[A6753] This explains how amisulpride reduces negative symptoms at low doses and mediates antipsychotic effects at high doses.[L32764] One study alluded that the antinociceptive effects of amisulpride are mediated through opioid receptor acvitation and D2 receptor antagonism. [A6753, A6755] The actions of amisulpride at opioid receptors may explain its pro-convulsant properties.[A6755]    Amisulpride is also an antiemetic agent that prevents and alleviates postoperative nausea and vomiting. It primarily works by blocking dopamine signalling in the chemoreceptor trigger zone, which is a brain area that relays stimuli to the vomiting center.[L32764]    In clinical trials comprising Caucasian and Japanese subjects, amisulpride caused dose- and concentration-dependent prolongation of the QT interval; thus, intravenous infusion under a strict dosing regimen and close monitoring of patients with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions are recommended.[L32759] Amisulpride increases plasma prolactin levels, leading to an association with benign pituitary tumours such as prolactinoma.[L32764]Dopamine is an essential and critical neurotransmitter produced in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental regions of the brain. Dopaminergic projection function in the nigrostriatal, mesolimbic, and mesocortical systems. Hyperactive dopamine transmission in the mesolimbic areas, or dopamine dysregulation in various major brain regions, is understood as the key driver of positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia.[A189156] Many antipsychotic agents act as D2 receptor antagonists, as with amisulpride.[A6752] Amisulpride is a selective dopamine D2 and D3 receptor antagonist.[L32759] It has high preferential activity towards dopamine receptors in the limbic system rather than the striatum, leading to a lower risk of extrapyramidal side effects than other atypical antipsychotic agents.[A6754, A232269] At low doses, amisulpride reduces negative symptoms of schizophrenia by blocking pre-synaptic dopamine D2 and D3 receptors, increasing the levels of dopamine in the synaptic cleft and facilitating dopaminergic transmission.[A6754] At higher doses, amisulpride blocks postsynaptic receptors, inhibiting dopaminergic hyperactivity: this explains the drug improving positive symptoms.[A6751] Amisulpride also works as an antagonist at 5-HT7A receptors [A16931] and 5-HT2A receptors,[A6754] which may be related to its antidepressant effects.[A6755]    The chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), also commonly known as the area postrema (AP), is an important brain region located within the dorsal surface of the medulla oblongata. CTZ is involved in emesis: it contains receptors, such as dopamine receptors, that are activated in response to emetic agents in the blood and relay information to the vomiting center, which is responsible for inducing the vomiting reflex.[A232374] Amisulpride is an antiemetic agent that works to limit signals that promote nausea and vomiting. Amisulpride binds to D2 and D3 receptors in the CTZ, leading to reduced dopaminergic signalling into the vomiting center.[L32759]    "
1114,"Resistance: Reduced susceptibility to simeprevir was most commonly associated with the viral NS3 Q80K polymorphism. Amino acid substitutions at NS3 positions S122, R155 and/or D168 are also shown to reduce susceptibility to simeprevir in genotype 1a/b patients.   Simeprevir is a hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease inhibitor indicated in patient's with HCV genotype 1 for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Like all NS3/4A inhibitors, simeprevir is a serine protease inhibitor in similarity to [DB08873] and [DB05521] but is classified as a second generation protease inhibitor. This class of antiviral drugs were the first direct acting antivirals approved but are associated with lower cure rates than newer drugs.Inhibiting HCV NS3/4A protease in a potent and highly specific manner, simeprevir is a direct-acting antiviral agent against the hepatitis C virus. Since the viral protease NS3/4A complex is essential for cleaving the HCV encoded polyprotein into individual viral proteins facilitating replication [A19632], the drug blocks the viral replication process. It is shown to display synergistic effects with interferon-α and HCV NS5B inhibitor, and additive effects with ribavirin in HCV replicon cells [A19629]. Unlike first generation serine protease inhibitors, simprevir has a sightly different resistance profile where limited therapeutic efficacy of the drug is observed with NS3 Q80K polymorphic variants and simeprevir-specific amino acid position of 168 also results in higher treatment failure rates [A19630]. The observed prevalence of the N3 Q80K polymorphism was 30% in subjects infected with HCV genotype 1a and 0.5% in subjects infected with HCV genotype 1b [A19630].     According to 2017 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and 2015 consensus guidelines from the Canadian Association for the Study of the Liver (CASL).SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626].    Simeprevir was approved by the FDA in November 2014 and is marketed under the brand name Olysio as oral tablets.In patients with HCV genotype 1 with compensated cirrhosis, the treatment is directed for 24 week duration. Sustained virologic response 12 weeks after planned end of treatment (SVR12) was achieved in 170/176 (97%) subjects without cirrhosis treated with 12 weeks simeprevir in combination with sofosbuvir (FDA Label). The overall SVR12 was 88% (44/50) in treatment-naïve patients with cirrhosis [L852].     this triple therapy allows shortening treatment duration from 48 weeks or longer to 12 or 24 weeks [A19630] depending on prior response status and presence of HIV-1 co-infection. Prior to initiation of treatment with [DB00008] and [DB00811], screening for the presence of virus with the NS3 Q80K polymorphism is strongly recommended and if detected, alternative treatment should be considered instead to prevent therapeutic failure. The SVR12 was 83% (29/35) in treatment-naïve patients and 86% (19/22) in relapsing patients.Simeprevir is a direct-acting antiviral agent and inhibitor for HCV NS3/4A protease, which is an important enzyme required for viral replication. Unlike [DB08873] and [DB05521], simeprevir is a competitive, reversible, macrocyclic, noncovalent inhibitor. The macromolecular cyclic portion of the molecule improves the affnity and selectivity characteristics, which allows rapid association and slow dissociation to the protein target through noncovalent binding [A19630]. Simeprevir is accumulated in the liver after uptake into hepatocytes via OATP1B1/3. NS3/4A heterodimeric complex is composed of the cofactor N4A subunit and N3 subunit which contains the proteolytic site. The NS3/4A protease cleaves the HCV polyprotein downstream of the NS3 site, generating non-structural viral proteins NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B and subsequently formation of mature proteins [A19630, A19632]. Simeprevir exerts an inhibitory action on HCV polyprotein cleavage via induced-fit binding to an extended S2 subsite located in the NS3 catalytic site [A19633]. NS3/4A inhibitors usually depend on few interactions located in the substrate binding groove of the viral serine protease, thus are susceptible to resistance and failed treatment from few critical mutations in these sites.   At higher concentration above their antiviral half-maximal effective concentration (EC50), simeprevir and other NS3/4A inhibitors also restore interferon (IFN)-signaling pathways that are thought to be disrupted by NS3/4A protease and recover innate immune processes. NS3/4A protease cleaves two essential adaptor proteins that initiate signaling leading to activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 and IFN-α/β synthesis, which are mitochondrial antiviral-signaling proteins (MAVS otherwise known as IPS-1, VISA, or Cardif) and toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)- domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-β (TRIF). Blocking the function of these adaptor proteins results in impaired interferon induction. NS3/4A inhibitors recover the proper IFN-signaling pathways [A19630, A19632]. "

This may influence several physiological functions including, but not restricted to, lowering both pre- and afterload of the heart and downregulation of sympathetic activity, and decreased intraglomerular pressure which is believed to be mediated by increased tubuloglomerular feedback.[L48246]    Increases in the amount of glucose excreted in the urine were observed in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus following the administration of dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin doses of 5 or 10 mg per day in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus for 12 weeks resulted in excretion of approximately 70 grams of glucose in the urine per day at Week 12. A near-maximum glucose excretion was observed at the dapagliflozin daily dose of 20 mg. This urinary glucose excretion with dapagliflozin also results in increases in urinary volume. After discontinuation of dapagliflozin, on average, the elevation in urinary glucose excretion approaches baseline by about 3 days for the 10 mg dose.[L48246]    Dapagliflozin was not associated with clinically meaningful prolongation of QTc interval at daily doses up to 150 mg (15 times the recommended maximum dose) in a study of healthy subjects. In addition, no clinically meaningful effect on QTc interval was observed following single doses of up to 500 mg (50 times the recommended maximum dose) of dapagliflozin in healthy subjects.[L48246]Dapagliflozin inhibits the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2(SGLT2) which is primarily located in the proximal tubule of the nephron.[A6757] SGLT2 facilitates 90% of glucose reabsorption in the kidneys and so its inhibition allows for glucose to be excreted in the urine.[A6757] This excretion allows for better glycemic control and potentially weight loss in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.[A6757] "
1116,"Indicated in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received one to three prior therapies.Elotuzumab is a humanized IgG1 (Immunoglobulin G) monoclonal antibody indicated in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received one to three prior therapies. Elotuzumab targets SLAMF7, also known as Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family member 7, a cell surface glycoprotein. Elotuzumab consists of the complementary determining regions (CDR) of the mouse antibody, MuLuc63, grafted onto human IgG1 heavy and kappa light chain frameworks. Elotuzumab is produced in NS0 cells by recombinant DNA technology. Elotuzumab has a theoretical mass of 148.1 kDa for the intact antibody. Elotuzumab was approved on November 30, 2015 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Elotuzumab is marketed under the brand Empliciti™ by Bristol-Myers Squibb.Elotuzumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that specifically targets the SLAMF7 (Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family member 7) protein. SLAMF7 is expressed on myeloma cells independent of cytogenetic abnormalities. SLAMF7 is also expressed on Natural Killer cells, plasma cells, and at lower levels on specific immune cell subsets of differentiated cells within the hematopoietic lineage. Elotuzumab directly activates Natural Killer cells through both the SLAMF7 pathway and Fc receptors. Elotuzumab also targets SLAMF7 on myeloma cells and facilitates the interaction with Natural Killer cells to mediate the killing of myeloma cells through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In preclinical models, the combination of elotuzumab and lenalidomide resulted in enhanced activation of Natural Killer cells that was greater than the effects of either agent alone and increased anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo."
1117,"Treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycemic control in combination with other agents or as monotherapy. Saxagliptin (rINN) is an orally active hypoglycemic (anti-diabetic drug) of the new dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor class of drugs. FDA approved on July 31, 2009.Post-administration of saxagliptin, GLP-1 and GIP levels rise up to 2- to 3- fold. Because it is very selective of DPP-4 inhibition, there are fewer systemic side effects. Saxagliptin inhibits DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. It also decreased glucagon concentrations and increased glucose-dependent insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) is 0.5 nmol/L.  Saxagliptin did not prolong the QTc interval to a clinically significant degree. Saxagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor antidiabetic for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. DPP-4 inhibitors are a class of compounds that work by affecting the action of natural hormones in the body called incretins. Incretins decrease blood sugar by increasing consumption of sugar by the body, mainly through increasing insulin production in the pancreas, and by reducing production of sugar by the liver. [Bristol-Myers Squibb Press Release]  DPP-4 is a membrane associated peptidase which is found in many tissues, lymphocytes and plasma. DPP-4 has two main mechanisms of action, an enzymatic function and another mechanism where DPP-4 binds adenosine deaminase, which conveys intracellular signals via dimerization when activated. Saxagliptin forms a reversible, histidine-assisted covalent bond between its nitrile group and the S630 hydroxyl oxygen on DPP-4. The inhibition of DPP-4 increases levels active of glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which inhibits glucagon production from pancreatic alpha cells and increases production of insulin from pancreatic beta cells.

1118,"[L14747]    Pertuzumab is also indicated for subcutaneous injection - in combination with trastuzumab and [hyaluronidase] - in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancers in adults.[L14510]Pertuzumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the extracellular dimerization domain (subdomain II) of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 protein (HER2). It consists of two heavy chains and two lights chains that have 448 and 214 residues respectively.Its indicated conditions have since expanded to include use as both a neoadjuvant therapy and an adjuvant therapy in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancers at high risk of recurrence.[L14642,L14772]Pertuzumab exerts its antineoplastic effects by binding to and inhibiting the activity of HER2, an oncogene that has been implicated in the formation of numerous cancers.[L14747] As with other therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, pertuzumab has a relatively long duration of action necessitating dosing every 3 weeks.[L14747] Drugs that block HER2 activity, including pertuzumab, have been implicated in the development of cardiotoxicity (specifically left ventricular dysfunction) - a baseline assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) should be conducted prior to beginning therapy with pertuzumab and at regular intervals throughout therapy to ensure LVEF remains within normal limits. Consider indefinite suspension of therapy if LVEF declines and does not improve.[L14747]Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) is a tyrosine kinase receptor that plays an integral role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. HER2 becomes active following dimerization with another HER2 receptor, another member of the HER protein family (e.g. HER3), or with a ligand - this dimer then phosphorylates and activates numerous intracellular signaling proteins, initiating signal transduction via pathways that include the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, the phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, and then Janus kinases/signal transducer and activator transcription pathway.[A214892] HER2 is also a known oncogene - it is overexpressed or gene-amplified (i.e. HER2-positive) in approximately 20% of breast cancers and these cancers carry a generally poorer prognosis than HER2-negative breast cancers.[A214892]    Pertuzumab targets the extracellular dimerization domain (subdomain II) of HER2, thereby inhibiting ligand-initiated intracellular signaling via the MAP kinase and PI3K pathways. Inhibition of these pathways results in inhibition of cell growth and the initiation of apoptosis, respectively.[L14642] Pertuzumab also appears to mediate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.[L14642]"

Rilonacept is also indicated for the maintenance of remission of Deficiency of Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist (DIRA) in adult and pediatric patients weighing at least 10 kg. Finally, rilonacept is indicated for the treatment of recurrent pericarditis (RP) and to reduce the risk of RP recurrence in patients aged 12 and older.[L40483]Rilonacept is a dimeric fusion protein consisting of portions of IL-1R and the IL-1R accessory protein linked to the Fc portion of immunoglobulin G1. Rilonacept functions as an interleukin 1 inhibitor and is used in the treatment of CAPS, also known as cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes, including familial cold auto-inflammatory syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS), in adults and children greater than 12 years old.Treatment with Rilonacept resulted in decreased levels of mean C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and Serum Amyloid A (SAA). Higher levels of CRP and SAA are associated with inflammatory disease activity found in patients with Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes. CAPS refer to rare genetic syndromes generally caused by mutations in the NLRP-3 [Nucleotide-binding domain, leucine rich family (NLR), pyrin domain containing 3] gene (also known as Cold-Induced Auto-inflammatory Syndtrome-1 [CIAS1]). CAPS disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with male and female offspring equally affected.

In most cases, inflammation in CAPS is associated with mutations in the NLRP-3 gene which encodes the protein cryopyrin, an important component of the inflammasome. Cryopyrin regulates the protease caspase-1 and controls the activation of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β). Mutations in NLRP-3 result in an overactive inflammasome resulting in excessive release of activated IL-1β that drives inflammation. Rilonacept blocks IL-1β signaling by acting as a soluble decoy receptor that binds IL-1β and prevents its interaction with cell surface receptors. Rilonacept also binds IL-1α and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) with reduced affinity. By binding IL-1, rilonacept prevents the activation of IL-1 receptors, thus reducing inflammatory responses and other effects related to an excess of IL-1."
1120,"Indicated for following conditions alone or in combination with conjugated estrogens in women with a uterus:    - Treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause    - Prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosisBazedoxifene is a third generation selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), developed by Pfizer following the completion of their takeover of Wyeth Pharmaceuticals. In late 2013, Pfizer received approval for bazedoxifene as part of the combination drug DUAVEE in the prevention (not treatment) of postmenopausal osteoporosis. It is approved in the European Union (marketed in Italy and Spain) and Japan as monotherapy. In 2013, the combination product containing conjugated estrogens and bazedoxifene was approved by the FDA for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause, as well as the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis in women.Bazedoxifene belongs to a class of compounds known as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). Bazedoxifene acts as both an oestrogen-receptor agonist and/or antagonist, depending upon the cell and tissue type and target genes. Bazedoxifene decreases bone resorption and reduces biochemical markers of bone turnover to the premenopausal range. These effects on bone remodelling lead to an increase in bone mineral density (BMD), which in turn contributes to a reduction in the risk of fractures. Bazedoxifene functions primarily as an oestrogen-receptor antagonist in uterine and breast tissues."
1121,"Doxercalciferol is indicated for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis, as well as for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with Stage 3 or Stage 4 chronic kidney disease. Doxercalciferol is a synthetic vitamin D2 analog that undergoes metabolic activation in vivo to form 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2 (1α,25-(OH)2D2), a naturally occurring, biologically active form of vitamin D2. Doxercalciferol is indicated for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis, as well as for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with Stage 3 or Stage 4 chronic kidney disease. Doxercalciferol is marketed under the brand name Hectoral by Genzyme Corporation, and is manufactured by Catalent Pharma Solutions, Inc.Calcitriol (1α,25-(OH)2D3) and 1α,25-(OH)2D2 regulate blood calcium at levels required for essential body functions. Specifically, the biologically active vitamin D metabolites control the intestinal absorption of dietary calcium, the tubular reabsorption of calcium by the kidney and, in conjunction with parathyroid hormone (PTH), the mobilization of calcium from the skeleton. They act directly on bone cells (osteoblasts) to stimulate skeletal growth, and on the parathyroid glands to suppress PTH (parathyroid hormone) synthesis and secretion. These functions are mediated by the interaction of these biologically active metabolites with specific receptor proteins in the various target tissues. In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), deficient production of biologically active vitamin D metabolites (due to lack of or insufficient 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1-alpha-hydroxylase activity) leads to secondary hyperparathyroidism, which contributes to the development of metabolic bone disease. "
1122,"Indicated in the treatment of anemias caused by deficient red cell production. Acquired aplastic anemia, congenital aplastic anemia, myelofibrosis and the hypoplastic anemias due to the administration of myelotoxic drugs often respond. Oxymetholone should not replace other supportive measures such as transfusion, correction of iron, folic acid, vitamin B12 or pyridoxine deficiency, antibacterial therapy and the appropriate use of corticosteroids. Oxymetholone is a synthetic anabolic steroid marketed under the brand name Anapolon by Hoffmann La Roche Limitedand used in the treatment of osteoporosis, anaemia, and as an agent to stimulate muscle growth in malnourished or underdeveloped patients. Anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS), such as oxymetholone, have been abused by bodybuilders and athletes. The uncontrolled misuse of oxymetholone can lead to a large variety of detrimental effects, the most often reported of which are cardiovascular events. In 2009, no producers of oxymetholone were identified worldwide (SRI 2009), but it was available from 14 suppliers, including 8 U.S. suppliers (ChemSources 2009).Oxymethalone is a 17 alpha-alkylated anabolic-androgenic steroid and a synthetic derivative of testosterone, whose anabolic effects are used to treat muscle wasting in HIV patients. The effects of testosterone in humans and other vertebrates occur by way of two main mechanisms: by activation of the androgen receptor (directly or as DHT), and by conversion to estradiol and activation of certain estrogen receptors. Free testosterone (T) is transported into the cytoplasm of target tissue cells, where it can bind to the androgen receptor, or can be reduced to 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the cytoplasmic enzyme 5α-reductase. DHT binds to the same androgen receptor even more strongly than T, so that its androgenic potency is about 2.5 times that of T. The T-receptor or DHT-receptor complex undergoes a structural change that allows it to move into the cell nucleus and bind directly to specific nucleotide sequences of the chromosomal DNA. The areas of binding are called hormone response elements (HREs), and influence transcriptional activity of certain genes, producing the androgen effects."
1123,"Investigated for use/treatment in sleep disorders, obstructive sleep apnea, schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders, depression, and bipolar disorders.Armodafinil is the enantiopure of the wakefulness-promoting agent modafinil (Provigil), and is indicated to improve wakefulness in adult patients with excessive sleepiness associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), narcolepsy, or shift work disorder (SWD). Research has shown that armodafinil significantly improves driving simulator performance in patients with SWD. Armodafinil consists of the (−)-R-enantiomer of the racemic modafinil. Armodafinil is produced by the pharmaceutical company Cephalon Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.) and was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in June 2007.Nuvigil (armodafinil) is a single-isomer of modafini. The exact mechanism of action is unknown. Armodafinil belongs to a class of drugs known as eugeroics, which are stimulants that provide long-lasting mental arousal. Pharmacologically, armodafinil does not bind to or inhibit several receptors and enzymes potentially relevant for sleep/wake regulation. Armodafinil is not a direct- or indirect-acting dopamine receptor agonist. However, in vitro, both armodafinil and modafinil bind to the dopamine transporter and inhibit dopamine reuptake.

1124,"[L9320]Etravirine is an antiretroviral agent more specifically classified as a Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NNRTI). Etraverine is used clinically for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. On January 18, 2007, the FDA granted accelerated approved for the use of etravirine 100mg tablets in the treatment of adult HIV-1 infection documented to be resistant to therapy with other NNRTIs and antiretroviral agents. Etravirine exerts its effects via direct inhibition of the reverse transcriptase enzyme of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and consequently blocks DNA-dependent and RNA-dependent polymerase activity. Etravirine does not inhibit human DNA polymerase alpha, beta or gamma.     Common side effects of use include mild to moderate rash within the first 6 weeks of therapy, nausea, diarrhea and peripheral neuropathy. Patients are advised to immediately contact their healthcare provider if a rash develops.     In 2009, postmarketing case reports of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, and other hypersensitivity reactions lead to a revision of etravirine's ""Warnings and Precautions,"" as well as notification of health care providers.     In 2013, reports of Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) in the setting of immune reconstitution, as well as more in depth information about the development of rashes in patients taking etravirine, lead to a modification of etravirine's monograph.Clinical trials have shown no prolongation of QT intervals on electrocardiograms after 8 days of dosing. Etravirine exerts its effects via direct inhibition of the reverse transcriptase enzyme of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1).  It directly binds reverse transcriptase and consequently blocks DNA-dependent and RNA-dependent polymerase activity. Etravirine does not inhibit human DNA polymerase alpha, beta or gamma.   "
1125,"Cethromycin currently has no FDA-approved indications; it was granted orphan drug designation for the prophylactic treatment of inhalation anthrax in 2007 and for the prophylactic treatment of both plague due to Yersinia pestis and tularemia due to Francisella tularensis in 2009.[L13988]Cethromycin is a 3-keto (ketolide) derivative of erythromycin A with an 11,12-carbamate group and an O-6-linked aromatic ring system.[A203369] Cethromycin represents a joint development effort by Abbott Laboratories, Taisho Pharmaceuticals, and Advanced Life Sciences, intended to be marketed under the trade name Restanza for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia.[L14006, A203369] However, after completing phase III clinical trials, it was deemed safe but not sufficiently efficacious by the FDA.[A203369]    Since this time, cethromycin has received FDA orphan drug designations for the prophylactic treatment of anthrax inhalation, plague due to Yersinia pestis, and tularemia due to Francisella tularensis.[L13988] It has also been investigated, by itself or together with [zoliflodacin], for the treatment of gonorrhea,[A203432, A203495] and was recently suggested as a possible treatment for liver-stage Plasmodium sporozoite infection.[A203441]Cethromycin binds to the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome to inhibit both ribosome assembly and bacterial protein synthesis.[A203369, A203417, A203417] Adverse effects such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and headache may be due to off-target inhibition of molecules within mammalian cells.[L14006]Respiratory tract infections can be caused by numerous strains of bacteria, requiring careful consideration of treatment and antibiotics effective against a broad spectrum of potential pathogens. Cethromycin, like other macrolide antibiotics, binds to the 23S rRNA of the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome. This binding, primarily mediated through regions II and V of the rRNA, occludes the peptide exit tunnel and inhibits bacterial protein synthesis. In addition, cethromycin is capable of binding to ribosomal intermediates during ribosome biogenesis, inhibiting the formation of functional 70S bacterial ribosomes. Due to the sequence and structural similarity of ribosomes between species, cethromycin displays broad-spectrum activity against diverse Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and atypical bacteria.[A203369, A203417, A203417]"
1126,"Investigated for use/treatment in fungal infections, aspergillosis, candidiasis, and onychomycosis."
1127,"For use as an adjunct to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for reducing the risk of periprocedural myocardial infarction (MI), repeat coronary revascularization, and stent thrombosis (ST) in patients in who have not been treated with a P2Y12 platelet inhibitor and are not being given a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor.Cangrelor is an intravenous, direct-acting, reversible P2Y12 inhibitor for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) who have not been yet treated by oral P2Y12 inhibitors. An advantage Cangrelor provides over oral P2Y12 inhibitors (such as prasugrel, ticagrelor, and clopidogrel) is that it is an active drug not requiring metabolic conversion therefore providing a rapid onset and offset of action. Cangrelor was approved by the FDA in June 2015 for intravenous application.Cangrelor is a selective, reversible, P2Y12 platelet receptor antagonist which inhibits ADP platelet aggregation. ADP is typically released by damaged blood vessels, red blood cells, and/or platelets due to agonists stimulating platelet activity. ADP binds to P2Y12 to stimulate and complete platelet aggregation by inhibiting adenylyl cyclase by a Gi protein, thus potentiating dense granule secretion and increasing coagulation activity. Cangrelor acts on the same target as oral irreversible inhibitors clopidogrel and ticlopidine and has a similar mechanism of action, but is reversible and provides a fast onset and offset of action.

1129,"Treatment of advanced renal cell cancer and advanced soft tissue sarcoma (in patients previously treated with chemotherapy) Pazopanib is a small molecule inhibitor of multiple protein tyrosine kinases with potential antineoplastic activity. It is developed by GlaxoSmithKline and was FDA approved on October 19, 2009.Pazopanib is a synthetic indazolylpyrimidine and reaches steady state concentrations of >15 μg/ml. This concentration is high enough to observe maximal inhibition of VEGFR2 phosphorylation and some anti-tumour activity (concentration required to inhibit receptors is 0.01 - 0.084 μmol/L). A reduction in tumour blood flow, increased tumour apoptosis, inhibition of tumour growth, reduction in tumour interstitial fluid pressure, and hypoxia in cancer cells can be observed in patients receiving treatment. Pazopanib is a second-generation multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor against vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1, -2, and -3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta, and c-kit. These receptor targets are part of the angiogenesis pathway that facilitates the formation of tumour blood vessel for tumour survival and growth. "

Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia.The time that unbound plasma concentration of ceftaroline exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the infecting organism has been shown to best correlate with efficacy in a neutropenic murine thigh infection model with S. aureus and S. pneumoniae.    No significant effect on QTc (corrected QT interval) interval was detected at peak plasma concentration or at any other time.Ceftaroline fosamil is an antibacterial drug.
1131,"Agomelatine is indicated to treat major depressive episodes in adults.Agomelatine is structurally closely related to melatonin. Agomelatine is a potent agonist at melatonin receptors and an antagonist at serotonin-2C (5-HT2C) receptors, tested in an animal model of depression. Agomelatine was developed in Europe by Servier Laboratories Ltd. and submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2005. The Committee for Medical Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended refusal of marketing authorization on 27 July 2006. The major concern was that efficacy had not been sufficiently shown. In 2006 Servier sold the rights to develop Agomelatine in the US to Novartis.    The development for the US market was discontinued in October 2011. It is currently sold in Australia under the Valdoxan trade name.Agomelatine resynchronises circadian rhythms in animal models of delayed sleep phase syndrome and other circadian rhythm disruptions. It increases noradrenaline and dopamine release specifically in the frontal cortex and has no influence on the extracellular levels of serotonin. Agomelatine has shown an antidepressant-like effect in animal depression models, (learned helplessness test, despair test, and chronic mild stress) circadian rhythm desynchronisation, and in stress and anxiety models. In humans, agomelatine has positive phase shifting properties; it induces a phase advance of sleep, body temperature decline and melatonin onset. Controlled studies in humans have shown that agomelatine is as effective as the SSRI antidepressants paroxetine and sertraline in the treatment of major depressionThe novel antidepressant agent, agomelatine, behaves as an agonist at melatonin receptors (MT1 and MT2) and as an antagonist at serotonin (5-HT)(2C) receptors."
1132,"Investigated for use/treatment in adult patients with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are FLT3 mutation-positive, agressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM), systemic mastocytosis with associated hematological neoplasm (SM-AHN), or mast cell leukemia (MCL). Midostaurin (as Rydapt) is a multitarget kinase inhibitor for the treatment for adult patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who have a specific genetic mutation called FLT3. It was initially characterized as a potential broad-spectrum antineoplastic agent, with activity toward diverse solid and hematopoietic tumors [A19108]. It was approved on April 28, 2017 and has shown to increase the overall survival rate in patients with AML as an adjunct therapy along with chemotherapeutic agents.It targets multiple WT and mutated kinases that, when activated, constitutively stimulate aberrant signalling cascades that lead to malignancies such as AML and ASM.  Alternative pharmacodynamic effect of midostaurin in prolonging QTc intervals was not clinically significant in patients with advanced SM or AML when compared to placebo. Midostaurin is therapeutically beneficial as a combination therapy for patients undergoing chemotherapy. It potently inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases. Midostaurin and its major active metabolites CGP62221 and CGP52421 inhibit the activity of protein kinase C alpha (PKCalpha), VEGFR2, KIT, PDGFR and WT and/or mutant FLT3 tyrosine kinases. Inhibition of FLT3 receptor signalling cascades induces apoptosis of target leukemia cells expressing target receptors and mast cells, in addition to its antiproliferative activity toward multiple cancer cell lines [A19108].   Midostaurin also interacts with organic anion transporter (OATP) 1A1 and multidrug resistance protein (MRP)-2 according to preliminary in vitro studies."
1133,"Panobinostat is indicated in the treatment of multiple myeloma in combination with dexamethasone and bortezomib in patients who have received 2 previous treatment regimens including bortezomib and an immunomodulatory agent. This indication is approved by accelerated approval based on progression free survival as of February 23, 2015. Panobinostat is an oral deacetylace (DAC) inhibitor approved on February 23, 2015 by the FDA for the treatment of multiple myeloma. The approval was accelerated based on progression-free survival, therefore confirmatory trials by the sponsor to demonstrate clinical efficacy in multiple myeloma treatment are in progress of being conducted. Panobinostat is marketed by Novartis under the brand name Farydak. Panobinostat acts as a non-selective histone deacetylase inhibitor (pan-HDAC inhibitor) and it is the most potent DAC inhibiting agent available on the market.Panobinostat is a deacetylase (DAC) inhibitor. DACs, also known as histone DACs (HDAC), are responsible for regulating the acetylation of about 1750 proteins in the body; their functions are involved in many biological processes including DNA replication and repair, chromatin remodelling, transcription of genes, progression of the cell-cycle, protein degradation and cytoskeletal reorganization. In multiple myeloma, there is an overexpression of DAC proteins. Panobinostat inhibits class I (HDACs 1, 2, 3, 8), class II (HDACs 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10) and class IV (HDAC 11) proteins. Panobinostat's antitumor activity is believed to be attributed to epigenetic modulation of gene expression and inhibition of protein metabolism. Panobinostat also exhibits cytotoxic synergy with bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor concurrently used in treatment of multiple myeloma. "

1136,"Bosutinib is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 1 year of age and older with chronic phase Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia that is newly diagnosed or resistant or intolerant to prior therapy. It is also indicated for the treatment of adult patients with accelerated or blast phase Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia that is newly diagnosed or resistant or intolerant to prior therapy.[L48355]Bosutinib is a 7-alkoxy-3-quinolinecarbonitrile that functions as a potent, dual SRC and ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor indicated for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), specifically Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) CML. Philadelphia chromosome is a hallmark of CML due to the reciprocal translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11), resulting in a BCR-ABL fusion protein.[A6902,A261796,A261801] The first BCR-ABL inhibitor, [imatinib], was introduced over a decade ago as a breakthrough in CML management; however, emerging resistance to [imatinib] poses challenges in achieving remission.[A17961] Second-generation BCR-ABL inhibitors like bosutinib inhibit most resistance-conferring BCR-ABL mutations except V299L and T315, thus providing more therapeutic options for patients.[A6901,A17961]    Bosutinib was first approved by the FDA in 2012 for the treatment of adult chronic, accelerated, or blast-phase Ph+ CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy.[L48436] On September 26, 2023, bosutinib was also approved by the FDA for the treatment of pediatric CML that is newly diagnosed or resistant/intolerant to prior therapy. This approval was based on favorable results obtained from the open-label, randomized, multicenter trial BFORE that showed a significant improvement in major molecular response, defined as a ≤0.1% BCR ABL ratio on an international scale, with bosutinib treatment.[L48441]A greater likelihood of response and a greater likelihood of safety events were observed with higher bosutinib exposure in clinical studies. The time course of bosutinib pharmacodynamic response has not been fully characterized.[L48355]     At a single oral dose of 500 mg bosutinib with ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A inhibitor), bosutinib does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent.[L48355] Bosutinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Bosutinib inhibits the BCR-ABL kinase that promotes CML; it is also an inhibitor of Src-family kinases including Src, Lyn, and Hck.

It is reported to exhibit potency that is 50-450 times higher than that of the first generation VEGFR inhibitors.[L6676] Axitinib is an indazole derivative.[A179398] It is most commonly marketed under the name Inlyta® and is available in oral formulations.Axitinib prevents the progression of cancer by inhibiting angiogenesis and blocking tumor growth.Axitinib selectively blocks the tyrosine kinase receptors VEGFR-1 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor), VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3."
1138,"Isavuconazonium is indicated for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis and mucormycosis in adults and pediatric patients 1 year of age and older in capsule form and adults and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older who weigh 16 kilograms (kg) and greater in injection form.[L49211]Isavuconazonium is a second-generation triazole antifungal approved on March 6, 2015 by the FDA and July 2015 by the EMA for the treatment of adults with invasive aspergillosis and invasive mucormycosis, marketed by Astellas under the brand Cresemba.[A38834] It is the prodrug form of isavuconazole, the active moiety, and it is available in oral and parenteral formulations. Due to low solubility in water of isavuconazole on its own, the isovuconazonium formulation is favorable as it has high solubility in water and allows for intravenous administration. This formulation also avoids the use of a cyclodextrin vehicle for solubilization required for intravenous administration of other antifungals such as voriconazole and posaconazole, eliminating concerns of nephrotoxicity associated with cyclodextrin. Isovuconazonium has excellent oral bioavailability, predictable pharmacokinetics, and a good safety profile, making it a reasonable alternative to its few other competitors on the market.[A6913,A6914,A262706]    On December 08, 2023, the FDA approved the expanded use of isovuconazonium in pediatric patients for the same indications.[L49251]In patients treated with isavuconazonium for invasive aspergillosis in a controlled trial, there was no significant association  between plasma AUC or plasma isavuconazole concentration and efficacy.[L49211]    The effect on QTc interval of multiple doses of isavuconazonium capsules was evaluated. Isavuconazonium was administered as  2 capsules (equivalent to 200 mg isavuconazole) three times daily on days 1 and 2 followed by either 2 capsules or 6  capsules (equivalent to 600 mg isavuconazole) once daily for 13 days in a randomized, placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg single-dose), four-treatment-arms, parallel study in 160 healthy subjects.[L49211]    Isavuconazole resulted in dose-related shortening of the QTc interval. For the 2-capsule dosing regimen, the least squares  mean (LSM) difference from placebo was -13.1 msec at 2 hours postdose [90% CI: -17.1, -9.1 msec]. Increasing the dose  to 6 capsules resulted in an LSM difference from the placebo of -24.6 msec at 2 hours postdose [90% CI: -28.7, -20.4].  Isavuconazonium was not evaluated in combination with other drugs that reduce the QTc interval, so the additive effects are  not known.[L49211]    The mechanism of resistance to isavuconazole, like other azole antifungals, is likely due to multiple mechanisms that  include substitutions in the target gene CYP51. Changes in sterol profile and elevated efflux pump activity were observed;  however, the clinical relevance of these findings is unclear.[L49211]     In vitro and animal studies suggest cross-resistance between isavuconazole and other azoles. The relevance of cross-resistance to clinical outcomes has not been fully characterized; however, patients failing prior azole therapy may require alternative antifungal therapy.[L49211] Isavuconazonium sulfate is the prodrug of isavuconazole, an azole antifungal. Isavuconazole inhibits the synthesis of ergosterol, a key component of the fungal cell membrane, by inhibiting cytochrome P-450-dependent enzyme lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase (Erg11p). This enzyme is responsible for the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol. An accumulation of methylated sterol precursors and a depletion of ergosterol within the fungal cell membrane weaken the membrane structure and function. Mammalian cell demethylation is less sensitive to isavuconazole inhibition.[L49211]     "
1139,"Denosumab under the brand name Prolia is indicated as a treatment for osteoporosis in menopausal women or men and glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in men and women at high risk of fracture. It is also used to increase bone mass in men at high risk for fractures receiving androgen deprivation therapy for nonmetastatic prostate cancer or women at high risk for fractures receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy for breast cancer.[L49796]     Denosumab under the brand name Xgeva is indicated to prevent skeletal-related events in patients with multiple myeloma and in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors and to treat giant cell tumors of bone in adults and skeletally mature adolescents and hypercalcemia of malignancy refractory to bisphosphonate therapy.[L49806] Denosumab is a novel, fully human IgG2 monoclonal antibody specific to receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), suppresses bone resorption via inhibiting RANK-mediated activation of osteoclasts. It is the first and currently the only RANKL inhibitor approved to prevent osteoclast-mediated bone loss.[A263071] Chemically, it consists of 2 heavy and 2 light chains, with each light chain consisting of 215 amino acids and each heavy chain consisting of 448 amino acids with 4 intramolecular disulfides.[A263066]      Denosumab was approved by the FDA approved on June 2010 for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. It further received additional indication approval to increase bone mass in men at high risk for fracture receiving androgen deprivation therapy for non-metastatic prostate cancer and women at high risk for fracture receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy for breast cancer in September 2011 and in men with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture in September 2012.[A263066]In clinical studies, treatment with 60 mg of denosumab resulted in a reduction in the bone resorption marker serum type 1 C-telopeptide (CTX) by approximately 85% by 3 days, with maximal reductions occurring by 1 month. CTX levels were below the limit of assay quantitation (0.049 ng/mL) in 39% to 68% of patients 1 to 3 months after dosing of denosumab. At the end of each dosing interval, CTX reductions were partially attenuated from a maximal reduction of ≥ 87% to ≥ 45% (range: 45% to 80%), as serum denosumab levels diminished, reflecting the reversibility of the effects of denosumab on bone remodelling.[L49796]    These effects were sustained with continued treatment. Upon reinitiation, the degree of inhibition of CTX by denosumab was similar to that observed in patients initiating denosumab treatment. Consistent with the physiological coupling of bone formation and resorption in skeletal remodeling, subsequent reductions in bone formation markers (i.e., osteocalcin and procollagen type 1 N-terminal peptide [P1NP]) were observed starting 1 month after the first dose of denosumab. After discontinuation of denosumab therapy, markers of bone resorption increased to levels 40% to 60% above pretreatment values but returned to baseline levels within 12 months.[L49796]    In patients with breast cancer and bone metastases, the median reduction in urinary N-terminal telopeptide corrected for creatinine (uNTx/Cr) was 82% within 1 week following initiation of denosumab 120 mg administered subcutaneously. In Studies 20050136, 20050244, and 20050103, the median reduction in uNTx/Cr from baseline to Month 3 was approximately 80% in 2075 denosumab-treated patients.[L49806]     In a phase 3 study of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who received subcutaneous doses of denosumab 120 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W), median reductions in uNTx/Cr of approximately 75% were observed by week 5. Reductions in bone turnover markers were maintained, with median reductions of 74% to 79% for uNTx/Cr from weeks 9 to 49 of continued 120 mg Q4W dosing.[L49806]   Denosumab is designed to target RANKL (RANK ligand), a protein that acts as the primary signal to promote bone removal/resorption. In many bone loss conditions, RANKL overwhelms the body's natural defense against bone destruction. Denosumab prevents RANKL from activating its receptor, RANK, on the surface of osteoclasts and their precursors. Prevention of the RANKL/RANK interaction inhibits osteoclast formation, function, and survival, thereby decreasing bone resorption and increasing bone mass and strength in both cortical and trabecular bone.[L49796]  "
1140,"[L12612]    In patients with recurrent or progressive CLL, ofatumumab is indicated for extended treatment of patients who are in complete or partial response after at least two lines of therapy for recurrent or progressive CLL.[L12612]    Ofatumumab is indicated for the treatment of patients with CLL refractory to [fludarabine] and [alemtuzumab].[L12612]    Ofatumumab is also indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, including active secondary progressive disease, clinically isolated syndrome, and relapsing-remitting disease.[L15581]Ofatumumab is a novel anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that targets B-cells. It is an IgG1κ human monoclonal antibody produced from a recombinant murine cell line (NS0) via transgenic mouse and hybridoma technology.[L12612] Ofatumumab works by recognizing antigens that are expressed on the tumour cells in certain cancers; however, the antigen is not tumour-specific and can also be found in normal B-cells.[A6921] Ofatumumab was first approved by the FDA in 2009.[L12771] It is used in the treatment of recurrent, progressive, or recurrent chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or CLL in treatment-naive patients in whom fludarabine-based therapy is considered inappropriate. Ofatumumab is used as monotherapy or in combination with other medications, depending on the patient profile and previous treatment history.[L12612] Although it has a similar molecular mechanism of action as [rituximab], another CD-20 monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, ofatumumab has a higher affinity towards CD20.[A6921]    Ofatumumab is available for intravenous administration and is marketed as Arzerra. In Phase III clinical trials consisting of subjects with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS), subcutaneous administration of ofatumumab reduced the number of relapses and delayed disease progression. In February 2020, FDA and EMA approved Supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) and Marketing Authorization Application (MAA), respectively, for ofatumumab for the treatment of RMS in adults.[L12753] The FDA subsequently approved ofatumumab for the treatment of RMS on August 20, 2020.[L15581] The potential therapeutic use of ofatumumab in various lymphomas and rheumatoid arthritis has also been investigated.[A193053]Ofatumumab works by binding to and blocking the action of CD-20, a molecule expressed on the surface of both healthy and leukemic B lymphocytes. In patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), ofatumumab caused B-cell depletion in the peripheral blood after six months following the last dose. However, observable depletion of B cells in the peripheral blood does not directly correlate with the depletion of B-cells in solid organs or malignant tumours.[L12612] In vitro, ofatumumab induces complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).[A6921]CD20 is expressed on normal pre-B lymphocytes and mature B lymphocytes, as well as malignant B lymphocytes. Numerous studies demonstrate that the depletion of B-cells can significantly alleviate symptoms of many forms of leukemia and lymphoma, which are malignancies associated with B-cell dysfunctions and high expression of CD20.[A193053]     Ofatumumab is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that binds to the small and large extracellular loops of the CD20 molecule. The Fab domain of ofatumumab binds to CD20, and this drug-target interaction does not result in immediate shedding and internalization of CD20 from the plasma membrane of B lymphocytes.[A6923,L12612] This allows ofatumumab to persist on the B lymphocyte cell surface for an extended period and recruit immunological molecules or FcR-expressing innate effectors, such as macrophages, that mediate immune effector functions with strong cytotoxic effects.[A6923,A193053] These immune effector functions include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CCD) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), which promote the lysis of malignant B-cells.[A6923,A193053,L12612] Complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) involves translocation of the CD20 molecule into lipid rafts, which are involved in cell signalling and receptor trafficking.[A6921]    The mechanism by which ofatumumab exerts a therapeutic effect in multiple sclerosis patients is unknown but is presumed to still occur as a consequence of its ability to bind CD20.[L15581]"
1141,"Saxenda, a formulation of liraglutide intended for weight loss, is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise for chronic weight management in adult patients who are obese (BMI≥30 kg/m2), or who are overweight (BMI≥27 kg/m2) and have at least one weight-related comorbidity. It is also indicated for chronic weight management in pediatric patients ≥12 years old who weigh ≥60 kg and have an initial BMI corresponding to obesity based on international cut-offs.[L38839]    Victoza, a formulation of liraglutide used in diabetes, is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in patients ≥10 years old with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is also indicated to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adult patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease.[L38844]Victoza contains liraglutide, a synthetic analog of human glucagon-like peptide-1(GLP-1) and acts as a GLP-1 receptor agonist.[Label,A6932] Liraglutide is 97% similar to native human GLP-1, differing primarily by substituting arginine for lysine at position 34.[A6932] Liraglutide is made by attaching a C-16 fatty acid (palmitic acid) with a glutamic acid spacer on the remaining lysine residue at position 26 of the peptide precursor.[A6932] Liraglutide was granted FDA approval on January 25, 2010.[L6070]Liraglutide is a once-daily GLP-1 derivative for the treatment of type 2 diabetes[Label,A177673]. The prolonged action of liraglutide is achieved by attaching a fatty acid molecule at position 26 of the GLP-1 molecule, enabling it to bind reversibly to albumin within the subcutaneous tissue and bloodstream and be released slowly over time[Label,A177673,A6930]. Binding with albumin results in slower degradation and reduced elimination of liraglutide from the circulation by the kidneys compared to GLP-1[A177673,A6930]. The effect of liraglutide is the increased secretion of insulin and decreased secretion of glucagon in response to glucose as well as slower gastric emptying[Label]. Liraglutide also does not adversely affect glucagon secretion in response to low blood sugar[Label,A177673].Liraglutide is an acylated synthetic glucagon-like peptide-1 analog[Label,A6932,A177673]. Liraglutide is an agonist of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor which is coupled to adenylate cyclase[Label]. The increase in cyclic AMP stimulates the glucose dependant release of insulin, inhibits the glucose dependant release of glucagon, and slows gastric emptying to increase control of blood sugar[Label,A6930]."
1142,"For the treatment of Cushing’s disease, specifically for those patients whom pituitary surgery has not been curative or is not an option.Pasireotide is a synthetic long-acting cyclic hexapeptide with somatostatin-like activity. It is marketed as a diaspartate salt called Signifor, which is used in the treatment of Cushing's disease.Signifor® is an analogue of somatostatin that promotes  reduced levels of cortisol secretion in Cushing's disease patients.Pasireotide activates a broad spectrum of somatostatin receptors, exhbiting a much higher binding affinity for somatostatin receptors 1, 3, and 5 than octreotide in vitro, as well as a comparable binding affinity for somatostatin receptor 2. The binding and activation of the somatostatin receptors causes inhibition of ACTH secretion and results in reduced cortisol secretion in Cushing's disease patients. Also this agent is more potent than somatostatin in inhibiting the release of human growth hormone (HGH), glucagon, and insulin. "
1143,"Used in adults (i) as an adjunct to methotrexate treatment in patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA)[L16626], (ii) in patients 2 years old and above with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA)[L16626], (iii) as a single agent in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) or in combination with methotrexate[L16631], and (iv) as a single agent in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC) who require chronic steroids or have experienced intolerance or only a partial response to previous medications.[L16631] It is also indicated (v) for the treatment of active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) in patients 2 years of age and older.[L16626]  Golimumab is a human IgG1қ monoclonal antibody derived from immunizing genetically engineered mice with human TNFα. Golimumab binds and inhibits soluble and transmembrane human TNFα. Increased TNFα is associated with chronic inflammation. Thus golimumab is indicated for use in adults (i) as an adjunct to methotrexate treatment in patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA), (ii) alone or as an adjunct to methotrexate treatment in patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA), (iii) as a single agent in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and (iv) as a single agent in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC) who require chronic steroids or have experienced intolerance or only a partial response to previous medications. In the U.S. and Canada, golimumab is marketed under the brand name Simponi®. The FDA label includes a black box warning of serious infections and malignancy. Additionally in children and adolescents taking golimumab, there have been lymphoma and other malignancies observed.Golimumab inhibits the activity of the cytokine, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). In areas such as the joints and blood, increased TNFα is associated with chronic inflammation seen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. Thus golimumab decreases the inflammation in these conditions. Concerning ulcerative colitis, the physiological effects of golimumab has yet to be determined.As a human monoclonal antibody, golimumab binds and inhibits soluble and transmembrane human TNFα. Inhibition of TNFα prevents it binding to its receptors, which prevents both leukocyte infiltration through prevention of cell adhesion proteins such as E-selectin, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion such as IL-6, IL-8, G-CSF and GM-CSF in vitro. Consequently, in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions, decreases in ICAM-1 and IL-6 as well as C-reactive protein (CRP), matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP-3), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were observed."
1144,"For prophylaxis of organ rejection. It is also used concomitantly with basiliximumab for induction therapy, mycophenolate, and corticosteriods in kidney transplant recepients that are seropositive for the Epstein-Barr virus. Belatacept is a soluble fusion protein, which links the extracellular domain of human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) to the modified Fc (hinge, CH2, and CH3 domains) portion of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1). Structurally, abatacept is a glycosylated fusion protein with a MALDI-MS molecular weight of 92,300 Da and it is a homodimer of two homologous polypeptide chains of 357 amino acids each. It is produced through recombinant DNA technology in mammalian CHO cells. The drug has activity as a selective co-stimulation modulator with inhibitory activity on T lymphocytes. It is approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Belatacept selectively blocks the process of T-cell activation. It was developed by Bristol-Myers-Squibb. Belatacept is only 2 amino acids different from abatacept (Orencia). FDA approved on June 15, 2011.Belatacept binds to CD86 with a 4-fold higher affinity than abatacept. It also binds to CD80 with a 2-fold higher affinity than abatacept. It was observed in non-human primates that belatacept prolongs graft survival due to a decrease in antibody production against the donor organ. Furthermore, belatacept also inhibits the primary humoral immune response which is indicated by the decrease in post-transplant levels of IgG, IgM, and IgA. The magnitude of this effect is more significant in belatacept than it is in cyclosporine. Belatacept is a fusion protein in which the Fc portion of human IgG1 is attached onto the extracellular portion of human CTLA-4 (CD152). Belatacept specifically binds to CD80 and CD86 receptors that are found on the antigen-presenting cell (B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells) to block selective T-cell lymphocyte costimulation. CD80 and CD86 would normally act as the ligands to the CD28 receptor T-cells in which this interaction triggers the activation of T lymphocytes. However in the presence of belatacept, because the extracellular CTLA-4 component binds to CD28 with higher affinity than CD80 or CD86, T lymphyocyte anergy, a state of antigen specific tolerance, occurs instead. The T cell is also no longer able to respond to their antigen. "

1146,"Vilazodone is approved for treatment of major depressive disorder.[Label,A38477,A177622]Vilazodone is a novel compound with combined high affinity and selectivity for the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) transporter and 5-HT(1A) receptors[Label,A177622]. Vilazodone may also be associated with less sexual dysfunction and weight gain[A6947]. Vilazodone was given FDA approval on January 21, 2011[L6046,A177622].Vilazodone increases serotonin levels in the brain by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin while acting as a partial agonist on serotonin-1A receptors[Label,A38477,A6947]. Due to this activity vilazodone has sometimes been referred to as a selective partial agonist and reuptake inhibitor (SPARI)[Label,A6947].Vilazodone selectively inhibits serotonin reuptake in the central nervous system as well as acting as a partial agonist of 5HT-1A receptors[Label,A38477]. The exact mechanism for how these effects translate to its antidepressant effects are not known[Label], though there is an association between these effects and antidepressive activity[A6947]."
1147,"For the treatment of patients with esophageal varices that have recently bled, to prevent rebleeding.Ethanolamine oleate is a mild sclerosing agent.  It is composed of ethanolamine, a basic substance, which when combined with oleic acid forms a clear, straw to pale yellow colored, deliquescent oleate.When injected intravenously, ethanolamine oleate acts primarily by irritation of the intimal endothelium of the vein and produces a sterile dose-related inflammatory response. This results in fibrosis and possible occlusion of the vein. Ethanolamine oleate also rapidly diffuses through the venous wall and produces a dose-related extravascular inflammatory reaction.The oleic acid component of ethanolamine oleate is responsible for the inflammatory response, and may also activate coagulation in vivo by release of tissue factor and activation of Hageman factor. The ethanolamine component, however, may inhibit fibrin clot formation by chelating calcium, so that a procoagulant action of ethanolamine oleate has not been demonstrated."
1148,"Nitrous oxide, commonly known as ""laughing gas"", is a chemical compound with the chemical formula N2O. At room temperature, it is a colorless non-flammable gas, with a pleasant, slightly sweet odor and taste. It is used in surgery and dentistry for its anesthetic and analgesic effects. It is known as ""laughing gas"" due to the euphoric effects of inhaling it, a property that has led to its recreational use as an inhalant drug.Findings to date indicate that nitrous oxide induces opioid peptide release in the brain stem leading to the activation of descending noradrenergic neurones, which results in modulation of the nociceptive process in the spinal cord. Several receptor–effector mechanisms including dopamine receptors, α2 adrenoceptors, benzodiazepine receptors and -methyl- -aspartate (NMDA) receptors have been implicated although the relationship of one with the other is not known."
1149,"Indicated for the treatment of allergic conditions, symptomatic relief of hypersensitivity reaction, and treatment of pruritic skin disorders.Mepyramine, or pyrilamine, targets the H1 receptor. It is a first generation antihistamine. However, it rapidly permeates the brain and so often causes drowsiness as a side effect. It has been found in over-the-counter combination products for colds and menstrual symptoms, but is considered to be an unapproved prescription medication used for cough, cold, or allergic conditions.Mepyramine is a histamine H1 receptor inverse agonist. It binds to a G protein-coupled form of the receptor and promotes a G protein-coupled inactive state of the H1 receptor that interferes with the Gq/11-mediated signaling. Mepyramine competes with histamine for binding at H1-receptor sites on the effector cell surface, resulting in suppression of histaminic edema, flare, and pruritus. The sedative properties of Mepyramine occur at the subcortical level of the CNS."
1150,"For prophylactic use to reduce perioperative blood loss and the need for blood transfusion in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass in the course of coronary artery bypass graft surgery who are at an increased risk for blood loss and blood transfusion.Aprotinin is a protein-based drug that is also known as bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI). Since it demonstrates the capacity to slow fibrinolysis, it has been employed to reduce bleeding during complex surgery such as heart and liver surgery. For this use, it is typically administered by injection. The goal of using of aprotinin was subsequently to minimize end-organ damage resulting from hypotension due to blood loss in surgery and to reduce the necessity for blood transfusions during surgery. Nevertheless, the drug was formally withdrawn worldwide in May of 2008 after studies confirmed that its use enhanced the risk of complications or death. The substance is consequently made available only for very restricted research use.Aprotinin is a broad spectrum protease inhibitor which modulates the systemic inflammatory response (SIR) associated with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery. SIR results in the interrelated activation of the hemostatic, fibrinolytic, cellular and humoral inflammatory systems. Aprotinin, through its inhibition of multiple mediators [e.g., kallikrein, plasmin] results in the attenuation of inflammatory responses, fibrinolysis, and thrombin generation. Aprotinin inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokine release and maintains glycoprotein homeostasis. In platelets, aprotinin reduces glycoprotein loss (e.g., GpIb, GpIIb/IIIa), while in granulocytes it prevents the expression of pro-inflammatory adhesive glycoproteins (e.g., CD11b). The effects of aprotinin use in CPB involves a reduction in inflammatory response which translates into a decreased need for allogeneic blood transfusions, reduced bleeding, and decreased mediastinal re-exploration for bleeding.Aprotinin inhibits serine proteases including trypsin, chymotrypsin and plasmin at a concentration of about 125,000 IU/mL, and kallikrein at 300,000 IU/mL. The inhibition of kallikrein inhibits formation of factor XIIa. This inhibits the intrinsic pathway of coagulation and fibrinolysis. Inhibition of plasmin also slows fibrinolysis."
1151,"Dabigatran etexilate is available in both oral pellet and capsule form. Dabigatran etexilate pellets are indicated for the treatment of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) in pediatric patients between three months and 12 years of age who have been treated with a parenteral anticoagulant for at least 5 days. They are also indicated in the same age group to reduce the risk of recurrence of VTE in patients who have been previously treated.[L34675]    In capsule form, dabigatran etexilate is indicated in adults to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism associated with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and for the treatment of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients who have been treated with a parenteral anticoagulant for 5-10 days. It is also indicated in adults to reduce the risk of recurrence of DVT and PE in patients who have been previously treated and for the prophylaxis of DVT and PE in patients who have undergone hip replacement surgery. Lastly, it is indicated in pediatric patients between eight and 18 years of age for the treatment of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) in patients who have been treated with a parenteral anticoagulant for at least 5 days and to reduce the risk of recurrence of VTE in patients who have been previously treated.[L34680]    Dabigatran etexilate is also approved by the EMA to prevent VTE in adult patients. For pediatric patients, Dabigatran etexilate is used to treat TVE and prevent recurrent TVE for patients from birth to less than 18 years of age.[L46856]Dabigatran etexilate is an oral prodrug that is hydrolyzed to the competitive and reversible direct thrombin inhibitor [dabigatran].[A177463, A6970, L34675, L34680] Dabigatran etexilate may be used to decrease the risk of venous thromboembolic events in patients in whom anticoagulation therapy is indicated.[A177463] In contrast to warfarin, because its anticoagulant effects are predictable, lab monitoring is not necessary.[A177463] Dabigatran etexilate was approved by the FDA in 2010.[L6022]Dabigatran etexilate is a double prodrug that is hydrolyzed to the active [dabigatran] by intestinal and hepatic carboxylesterases.[A236225, A17923, A236195] Dabigatran is a reversible competitive thrombin inhibitor that directly inhibits the conversion by thrombin of fibrinogen to fibrin, impairing the clotting process and acting as an anticoagulant.[A17924, A236200, A236210, L34675, L34680] Dabigatran use prolongs coagulation markers such as the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), ecarin clotting time (ECT), thrombin time (TT), and dilute thrombin time (dTT), but not the international normalized ratio (INR), which cannot be used in this context as it can in [warfarin] monitoring.[L34675, L34680]    As with all anticoagulant therapies, dabigatran carries a risk of bleeding, which may increase with concomitant use of antiplatelet agents, fibrinolytic therapy, heparins, or chronic NSAID use, and should be monitored for. Premature discontinuation of dabigatran, in the absence of an alternative anticoagulant, also carries an increased risk of thromboembolic events. Due to the risk of an epidural or spinal hematoma, dabigatran should generally not be used in the context of neuraxial anesthesia or spinal puncture; if such use is unavoidable, careful monitoring should be employed. Dabigatran should not be used in patients with prosthetic heart valves due to an increased occurrence of major bleeding and thromboembolic events. Dabigatran is a substrate of the P-gp transporter and should generally not be administered together with P-gp inhibitors or inducers, especially in patients with impaired renal function. Lastly, dabigatran or any other direct-acting oral anticoagulant should not be administered in patients with triple-positive antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) due to an increased risk of recurrent thrombotic events. In case of the need for emergency reversal, [idarucizumab] is available for use in adult patients; the safety and efficacy of [idarucizumab] has not been established in pediatric patients yet, for whom reversal may be achieved through hemodialysis, prothrombin complex concentrates, or recombinant FVIIa. However, none of these have been sufficiently evaluated in clinical trials.[L34675, L34680]Hemostasis is a complex process that balances coagulation to prevent excessive thrombus formation or excessive bleeding. Central to the coagulation process is the serine protease thrombin (FIIa), which is synthesized as inactive prothrombin (FII) and subsequently activated by FXa/FVa, leading to a positive feedback loop and the production of large quantities of thrombin; once enough thrombin is formed, it cleaves soluble fibrinogen to form insoluble fibrin fibres that, together with aggregated platelets, form a clot. Although beneficial in wound healing, aberrant thrombus formation can lead to serious health consequences.[A236205]    Dabigatran is a univalent reversible direct thrombin inhibitor (DTI) that competitively inhibits thrombin with a Ki of 4.5 ± 0.2 nmol/L.[A236200, A236210, L34675, L34680] Furthermore, the reversible nature of the inhibition is believed to allow for some normal physiological thrombin function, which may help alleviate some adverse effects associated with anticoagulation therapy.[A236215] In addition, dabigatran has several glucuronidated metabolites, all of which have been shown to possess _in vitro_ activity similar to the parent compound.[A17924]    In addition to a direct effect on thrombin activity, dabigatran has also been shown to inhibit platelet aggregation, another step in the coagulation pathway. However, the mechanism remains unclear as dabigatran inhibits platelet aggregation stimulated by thrombin and von Willebrand factor (vWF), but not by other pathways such as ADP- or thromboxane A2-induced aggregation.[A236210, A236220, A215227, L34675, L34680]"
1152,"Arbekacin is used for the short term treatment of multi-resistant bacterial infections, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).An semisynthetic aminoglycoside antibiotic. Often used for treatment of multi-resistant bacterial infection such as methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA).Arbekacin is an aminoglycoside. Aminoglycosides function by binding to bacterial 30S ribosomal subunits, causing t-RNA misreads, and preventing the production of proteins. Anaerobes are less susceptible to aminoglycosides because they do not spend as much energy as aerobes on taking up chemicals like aminoglycosides. Aminoglycosides are useful primarily in infections involving aerobic, gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and Enterobacter.Arbekacin irreversibly binds bacterial 30S and 16S ribosomal subunits inhibiting protein synthesis. Arbekacin binds to 4 nucleotides of the 16S subunit and 1 amino acid of protein S12 to interfere with the decoding site around nucleotide 1400 in the 16S subunit. Interference with the decoding site interferes with its interaction with the wobble base of tRNA. This hindered interaction causes mRNA to be misread and the incorrect amino acids are inserted into protein. These error filled proteins are not able to function or may even be toxic."
1153,"May also be used to treat uncomplicated malaria when the Plasmodium species has not been identified. Indicated for use in adults and children greater than 5 kg. Artemether is an antimalarial agent used to treat acute uncomplicated malaria. It is administered in combination with lumefantrine for improved efficacy. This combination therapy exerts its effects against the erythrocytic stages of Plasmodium spp. and may be used to treat infections caused by P. falciparum and unidentified Plasmodium species, including infections acquired in chloroquine-resistant areas.In the body, artemether is metabolized into the active metabolite metabolite dihydroartemisinin. The drug works against the erythrocytic stages of P. falciparum by inhibiting nucleic acid and protein synthesis. Artemether is administered in combination with lumefantrine for improved efficacy. Artemether has a rapid onset of action and is rapidly cleared from the body. It is thought that artemether provides rapid symptomatic relief by reducing the number of malarial parasites. Lumefantrine has a much longer half life and is believed to clear residual parasites. Involves an interaction with ferriprotoporphyrin IX (“heme”), or ferrous ions, in the acidic parasite food vacuole, which results in the generation of cytotoxic radical species. The generally accepted mechanism of action of peroxide antimalarials involves interaction of the peroxide-containing drug with heme, a hemoglobin degradation byproduct, derived from proteolysis of hemoglobin. This interaction is believed to result in the formation of a range of potentially toxic oxygen and carbon-centered radicals."
1154,"Betahistine is indicated for the reduction of recurrent vertigo episodes associated with Ménière's disease in patients 18 years old and above.[L16388]Ménière's disease is a progressive disease of the inner ear characterized by vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss. It has a significant impact on both the physical and social functioning of affected individuals.[A220318,L16408]     Betahistine is a histamine-like antivertigo drug used for treating symptoms associated with Ménière's disease. It is thought to reduce symptoms through its actions on histamine receptors.[A220333,L16403] Betahistine was first approved by the FDA in the 1970s but withdrawn within approximately 5 years due to a lack of evidence supporting its efficacy.  It is currently marketed in Canada by various companies, including Teva Pharmaceuticals.Through its actions on the histamine receptors, betahistine provides relief from vertigo associated with Ménière's disease.[A220328,A220433,L16388] Vertigo is a disturbing sensation of movement caused by dysfunction of the labyrinth (inner ear), vestibular nerve, cerebellum, brainstem, or Central Nervous System (CNS). Vestibular forms of vertigo are often accompanied by auditory dysfunctions such as hyperacusis, hearing loss, and tinnitus.[A220328] In most cases, adaptive mechanisms of the CNS lead to functional recovery after episodes of vertigo, however, syndromes such as Ménière's disease tend to cause the recurrence of vertigo symptoms. This significantly impacts the quality of life and the ability to carry out daily activities.[A220318]     **H1-receptor activity**    The mechanism of action of betahistine is multifactorial. Ménière's disease is thought to result from a disruption of endolymphatic fluid homeostasis in the ear.[A220438] Betahistine mainly acts as a histamine H1-receptor agonist. The stimulation of H1-receptors in the inner ear causes a vasodilatory effect leading to increased permeability of blood vessels and a reduction in endolymphatic pressure; this action prevents the rupture of the labyrinth, which can contribute to the hearing loss associated with  Ménière's disease. Betahistine is also purported to act by reducing the asymmetrical functioning of sensory vestibular organs and increasing vestibulocochlear blood flow, relieving symptoms of vertigo.[A220433]    **H3-receptor activity**    In addition to the above mechanisms, betahistine also acts as a histamine H3-receptor antagonist, increasing the turnover of histamine from postsynaptic histaminergic nerve receptors, subsequently leading to an increase in H1-agonist activity. H3-receptor antagonism elevates levels of neurotransmitters including serotonin in the brainstem, inhibiting the activity of vestibular nuclei, thus restoring proper balance and decreasing vertigo symptoms.[A220328]"
1155,"Desvenlafaxine is indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder in adults.[L47936] It has also been used off-label to treat hot flashes in menopausal women.[A261166]Desvenlafaxine (O-desmethylvenlafaxine) is the 0-demetyhlated active metabolite of [venlafaxine]. Like its parent drug, desvenlafaxine is also an antidepressant belonging to the class of serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) class.[A261266,A261266] It was approved by the FDA in 2008 for the treatment of adults with major depressive disorder (MDD).[L6016,A261271] MDD is a highly prevalent psychiatric disorder, with a lifetime prevalence estimate of 16% in the US alone and 12.8% in Europe. Although the exact mechanism of pathophysiology is still unknown, imbalances or deficiencies of monoamines have been heavily implicated, thus the rationale behind the use of SNRI to treat MDD.[A261271] Desvenlafaxine has a very similar pharmacological, efficacy, and safety profile as [venlafaxine]. The major difference is the potential for drug interaction since venlafaxine is mainly metabolized by CYP2D6 while desvenlafaxine is conjugated by UGT; therefore, desvenlafaxine is less likely to cause drug-drug interaction when taken with medications affecting the CYP2D6 pathway.[A261266]Desvenlafaxine is a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor.[A6990,A6991,L47936] It lacks significant activity on muscarinic-cholinergic, H1-histaminergic, or 1-adrenergic receptors in vitro, or inhibitory activity against monoamine oxidase.[L47936] Desvenlafaxine does not appear to exert activity against calcium, chloride, potassium and sodium ion channels and also lacks monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitory activity.[A6991] It was also shown to lack significant activity against the cardiac potassium channel, hERG, in vitro.[A36975] Electrocardiograms were obtained from 1,492 desvenlafaxine treated patients with major depressive disorder and 984 placebo-treated patients in clinical studies lasting up to 8 weeks. No clinically relevant differences were observed between desvenlafaxine treated and placebo-treated patients for QT, QTc, PR, and QRS intervals. In a thorough QTc study with prospectively determined criteria, desvenlafaxine did not cause QT prolongation. No difference was observed between placebo and desvenlafaxine treatments for the QRS interval.[L47936] The exact mechanism of the antidepressant action of desvenlafaxine is unknown but is thought to be related to the potentiation of serotonin and norepinephrine in the central nervous system, through inhibition of their reuptake.[L47936] Particularly, desvenlafaxine has been found to inhibit the serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine transporters with varying degrees of affinity. Desvenlafaxine inhibits serotonin transporters with 10 times the affinity of norepinephrine transporters, and dopamine transporters with the lowest affinity.[A6991]"
1156,"Fesoterodine is indicated for the treatment of overactive bladder in adult patients with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency.[L37624] It is also indicated in the treatment of neurogenic detrusor overactivity in pediatric patients ≥6 years old weighing >25 kg.[L37624]Fesoterodine is an antimuscarinic prodrug for the treatment of overactive bladder syndrome.In-vivo the fesoteridine prodrug is broken down into its active metabolite, 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), by plasma esterases. The 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite, which exhibits an antimuscarinic activity. Both urinary bladder contraction and salivation are mediated via cholinergic muscarinic receptors. Therefore, acting as a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist, fesoterodine ultimately acts to decrease the detrusor pressure by its muscarinic antagonism, thereby decreasing bladder contraction and consequently, the urge to urinate.Fesoterodine, once converted to its active metabolite, 5-hydroxymethyltolterodine, acts as a competitive antagonists at muscarinic receptors. This results in the inhibition of bladder contraction, decrease in detrusor pressure, and an incomplete emptying of the bladder."
1157,"Used as a topical nasal decongestant and vasoconstrictor in dentistry.Levonordefrin acts as a topical nasal decongestant and vasoconstrictor, most often used in dentistry.Levonordefrin is a sympathomimetic amine used as a vasoconstrictor in local anesthetic solutions. It has pharmacologic activity similar to that of Epinephrine but it is more stable than Epinephrine. In equal concentrations, Levonordefrin is less potent than Epinephrine in raising blood pressure, and as a vasoconstrictor.It is designed to mimic the molecular shape of adrenaline. It binds to alpha-adrenergic receptors in the nasal mucosa. Here it can, therefore, cause vasoconstriction."
1158,"Methyltestosterone is an anabolic steroid hormone used to treat men with a testosterone deficiency. It is also used in women to treat breast cancer, breast pain, swelling due to pregnancy, and with the addition of estrogen it can treat symptoms of menopause.A synthetic anabolic steroid used for treating men with testosterone deficiency or similar androgen replacement therapies. Also, has antineoplastic properties and so has been used secondarily in women with advanced breast cancer. Methyltestosterone is a schedule III drug in the US.Testosterone is a steroid hormone from the androgen group. Testosterone is primarily secreted from the testes of males. In females, it is produced in the ovaries, adrenal glands and by conversion of adrostenedione in the periphery. It is the principal male sex hormone and an anabolic steroid. In both males and females, it plays key roles in health and well-being. Examples include enhanced libido, energy, immune function, and protection against osteoporosis. On average, the adult male body produces about twenty times the amount of testosterone than an adult female's body does.The effects of testosterone in humans and other vertebrates occur by way of two main mechanisms: by activation of the androgen receptor (directly or as DHT), and by conversion to estradiol and activation of certain estrogen receptors. Free testosterone (T) is transported into the cytoplasm of target tissue cells, where it can bind to the androgen receptor, or can be reduced to 5&alpha;-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the cytoplasmic enzyme 5&alpha;-reductase. DHT binds to the same androgen receptor even more strongly than T, so that its androgenic potency is about 2.5 times that of T. The T-receptor or DHT-receptor complex undergoes a structural change that allows it to move into the cell nucleus and bind directly to specific nucleotide sequences of the chromosomal DNA. The areas of binding are called hormone response elements (HREs), and influence transcriptional activity of certain genes, producing the androgen effects."
1159,"Naphazoline is indicated for use as OTC eyedrops for ocular vasoconstriction or as a nasal preparation for nasal congestion[A176558,L5804,L5807].Naphazoline is a rapid acting imidazoline sympathomimetic vasoconstrictor of ocular or nasal artierioles[L5804,L5807]. It acts to decrease congestion and is found in many over the counter (OTC) eye drops and nasal preparations[L5804,L5807].    Naphazoline was first developed in 1942 as a nasal formulation for congestion[A176609].Naphazoline is a sympathomimetic alpha adrenergic agonist that acts to vasoconstrict nasal or ocular arterioles, resulting in reduced congestion at the site of administration[L5804,L5807].Naphazoline is a vasoconstrictor that functions by stimulating alpha adrenergic receptors in arterioles leading to decreased congestion at the site of administration[L5804].    Naphazoline causes the release of norepinephrine in sympathetic nerves[A176567]. Norepinephrine binds to alpha adrenergic receptors and causes vasoconstriction[A176567]. Naphazoline is also a mild beta adrenergic receptor agonist, which can cause rebound vasodilation after the alpha adrenergic stimulation has ended[A176567]. Naphazoline's release of norepinephrine also triggers a negative feedback loop which decreases production of norepinephrine, which can lead to rhinitis medicamentosa after long term use when naphazoline is stopped[A176567]."
1160,"For the management of vasospastic angina, chronic stable angina and hypertension.Nilvadipine is a calcium channel blocker (CCB) for the treatment of hypertension.Nilvadipine is similar to other dihydropyridines including amlodipine, felodipine, isradipine, and nicardipine. Nilvadipine is used to treat Prinzmetal's angina, hypertension, and other vascular disorders such as Raynaud's phenomenon. By blocking the calcium channels, Nifedipine inhibits the spasm of the coronary artery and dilates the systemic arteries, results in a increase of myocardial oxygen supply and a decrease in systemic blood pressure.Nilvadipine inhibits the influx of extracellular calcium through myocardial and vascular membrane pores by physically plugging the channel. The decrease in intracellular calcium inhibits the contractile processes of smooth muscle cells, causing dilation of the coronary and systemic arteries, increased oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue, decreased total peripheral resistance, decreased systemic blood pressure, and decreased afterload."
1161,"Potassium Iodide is oral antithyroid agent used in the prevention of radioactive iodine uptake into the thyroid gland during a nuclear radiation emergency. Potassium Iodide may be used as an adjunct to other antithyroid agents in the treatment of hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis and preoperatively to induce thyroid involution.Saturated solution of Potassium Iodide (SSKI) is used pharmaceutically for emergency use in patients experiencing acute symptoms of severe hyperthyroidism (also known as thyroid storm or thyrotoxic crisis). SSKI can also be used for radioiodine-contamination emergencies or in preparation of thyrotoxic patients for thyroidectomy.It works in the thyroid gland. By inhibiting thyroid hormone synthesis and release, thyroid gland vascularity is reduced, thyroid gland tissue becomes firmer, thyroid cell size is reduced, follicular colloid reaccumulates, and bound iodine levels increase. As a protectant following radiation exposure, KI blocks the uptake of radioactive iodine isotopes by the thyroid gland thereby minimizing the risk of radiation-induced thyroid neoplasms."
1162,"For monitored anaesthesia care sedation in patients undergoing diagnostic procedures like bronchoscopy and colonscopy or minor surgical procedures like arthroscopy and bunionectomy. Fospropofol is a water soluble prodrug and is converted to propofol in the liver. Fospropofol is a short acting hypnotic/sedative/anesthetic agent. Unlike propofol, does not cause injection-site pain as it is unable to activate TRPA1. FDA approved in December 2008.  Fospropofol is a Schedule IV controlled substance in the United States under the Controlled Substances Act.Fospropofol is a prodrug of propofol, a sedative hypnotic drug. Unlike propofol, fospropofol is water soluble and can be administered in an aqueous solution. 1.86 mg of fospropofol is the molar equivalent for 1mg of propofol. After in-vivo conversion of fospropofol into propofol by endothelial alkaline phosphatase, propofol crosses the blood-brain barrier, binds to GABA-A receptors and acts as an agonist. By binding to GABA-A receptor, it will cause an increase in chloride conductance, thus inhibiting the firing of new action potentials in the post-synaptic neuron. "
1163,"Fosaprepitant is indicated in adult and pediatric patients ≥6 months of age, in combination with other antiemetic agents, for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including high-dose [cisplatin].[L40338] It is also indicated for the treatment of delayed nausea and vomiting with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy.[L40338]Fosaprepitant is an intravenously administered antiemetic drug. It is a prodrug of Aprepitant. It aids in the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy treatment.Fosaprepitant is a prodrug of Aprepitant. Once biologically activated, the drug acts as a substance P/neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonist which, in combination with other antiemetic agents, is indicated for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy. Aprepitant is a selective high-affinity antagonist of human substance P/neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors. Aprepitant has little or no affinity for serotonin (5-HT3), dopamine, and corticosteroid receptors, the targets of existing therapies for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CI NV).Aprepitant has been shown in animal models to inhibit emesis induced by cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, such as cisplatin, via central actions. Animal and human Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies with Aprepitant have shown that it crosses the blood brain barrier and occupies brain NK1 receptors. Animal and human studies show that Aprepitant augments the antiemetic activity of the 5-HT3-receptor antagonist ondansetron and the corticosteroid  ethasone and inhibits both the acute and delayed phases of cisplatin induced emesis.  In summary, the active form of fosaprepitant is as an NK1 antagonist which is because it blocks signals given off by NK1 receptors. This therefore decreases the likelihood of vomiting in patients experiencing."
1164,"Stanozolol is a synthetic anabolic steroid with therapeutic uses in treating C1-inhibitor deficient hereditary angioedema. C1-inhibitor is a protease that inhibits the complement system (part of the innate immune system), a biochemical chain of reactions which assists the body in removing pathogens from the body. Stanozolol may help control attacks of hereditary angioedema.  Stanozolol can be administered orally or intramuscularly. Stanozolol is a synthetic anabolic steroid with therapeutic uses in treating hereditary angioedema. Stanozolol is derived from testosterone, and has been abused by several high profile professional athletes.Stanozolol is a synthetic anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS), which promotes cell growth (anabolism) and development/maintenance of masculine characteristics (androgenism).  Stanozolol binds to androgen receptors, such as membrane bound receptor proteins LAGS and stanozolol-binding protein (STBP). "
1165,"Buserelin may be used in the treatment of hormone-responsive cancers such as prostate cancer or breast cancer, estrogen-dependent conditions (such as endometriosis or uterine fibroids), and in assisted reproduction.Buserelin is a synthetic peptide analog of the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist, which stimulates the pituitary gland's gonadotrophin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR). It is used in prostate cancer treatment.The substitution of glycine in position 6 by D-serine, and that of glycinamide in position 10 by ethylamide, leads to a nonapeptide with a greatly enhanced LHRH effect. The effects of buserelin on FSH and LH release are 20 to 170 times greater than those of LHRH. Buserelin also has a longer duration of action than natural LHRH. Investigations in healthy adult males and females have demonstrated that the increase in plasma LH and FSH levels persist for at least 7 hours and that a return to basal values requires about 24 hours.  Clinical inhibition of gonadotropin release, and subsequent reduction of serum testosterone or estradiol to castration level, was found when large pharmacologic doses (50-500 mcg SC/day or 300-1200 mcg IN/day) were administered for periods greater than 1 to 3 months. Chronic administration of such doses of buserelin results in sustained inhibition of gonadotropin production, suppression of ovarian and testicular steroidogenesis and, ultimately, reduced circulating levels of gonadotropin and gonadal steroids. These effects form the basis for buserelin use in patients with hormone-dependent metastatic carcinoma of the prostate gland as well as in patients with endometriosis.Buserelin stimulates the pituitary gland's gonadotrophin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR). Buserelin desensitizes the GnRH receptor, reducing the amount of gonadotropin. In males, this results in a reduction in the synthesis and release of testosterone. In females, estrogen secretion is inhibited. While initially, there is a rise in FSH and LH levels, chronic administration of Buserelin results in a sustained suppression of these hormones."
1166,"For relief of heartburn and acid indigestion. May also be used as a nutritional supplement or to treat hypocalcemia. Calcium carbonate is an inorganic salt used as an antacid. It is a basic compound that acts by neutralizing hydrochloric acid in gastric secretions. Subsequent increases in pH may inhibit the action of pepsin. An increase in bicarbonate ions and prostaglandins may also confer cytoprotective effects. Calcium carbonate may also be used as a nutritional supplement or to treat hypocalcemia.Gastric-peptic disease occurs as a result of an imbalance between protective factors, such as mucus, bicarbonate, and prostaglandin secretion, and aggressive factors, such as hydrochloric acid, pepsin, and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). Antacids work by restoring acid-base balance, attenuating the pepsin activity and increasing bicarbonate and prostaglandin secretion. The acid-neutralizing capacity of calcium carbonate is 58 mEq/15 ml.   When used as a nutritional supplement, calcium carbonate acts by directly increasing calcium stores within the body. Calcium carbonate is a basic inorganic salt that acts by neutralizing hydrochloric acid in gastric secretions. It also inhibits the action of pepsin by increasing the pH and via adsorption. Cytoprotective effects may occur through increases in bicarbonate ion (HCO3-) and prostaglandins. Neutralization of hydrochloric acid results in the formation of calcium chloride, carbon dioxide and water. Approximately 90% of calcium chloride is converted to insoluble calcium salts (e.g. calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate). "
1167,"For the treatment of acute mild to moderate pain, as well as pain and inflammation of the joints caused by certain types of rheumatic diseases.Lornoxicam (chlortenoxicam) is a new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of the oxicam class with analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties. Lornoxicam differs from other oxicam compounds in its potent inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis, a property that explains the particularly pronounced efficacy of the drug. Lornoxicam is approved for use in Japan.Lornoxicam is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that belongs to the oxicam class. As with other NSAIDS, lornoxicam is a potent inhibitor of the cyclooxgenase enzymes, which are responsible for catalyzing the formation of prostaglandins (act as messenger molecules in the process of inflammation) and thromboxane from arachidonic acid. Unlike some NSAIDS, lornoxicam's inhibition of cyclooxygenase does not lead to an increase in leukotriene formation, meaning that arachidonic acid is not moved to the 5-lipoxygenase cascade, resulting in the minimization of the risk of adverse events.Like other NSAIDS, lornoxicam's anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity is related to its inhibitory action on prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis through the inhibition of both COX-1 and COX-2. This leads to the reduction of inflammation, pain, fever, and swelling, which are mediated by prostaglandins. However, the exact mechanism of lornoxicam, like that of the other NSAIDs, has not been fully determined."
1168,"Sparteine is a plant alkaloid derived from Cytisus scoparius and Lupinus mutabilis which may chelate calcium and magnesium. It is a sodium channel blocker, so it falls in the category of class 1a antiarrhythmic agents.

1170,"Aceclofenac is indicated for the relief of pain and inflammation in osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Aceclofenac is an oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with marked anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties used to treat osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. It is reported to have a higher anti-inflammatory action or at least comparable effects than conventional NSAIDs in double-blind studies [A19667, A19668, A19670]. Aceclofenac potently inhibits the cyclo-oxygenase enzyme (COX) that is involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins, which are inflammatory mediators that cause pain, swelling, inflammation, and fever. Aceclofenac belongs to BCS Class II as it possesses poor aqueous solubility [A19667]. It displays high permeability to penetrate into synovial joints where in patients with osteoarthritis and related conditions, the loss of articular cartilage in the area causes joint pain, tenderness, stiffness, crepitus, and local inflammation [A19666]. Aceclofenac is also reported to be effective in other painful conditions such as dental and gynaecological conditions [A19672]. In 1991, aceclofenac was developed as an analog of a commonly prescribed NSAID, [DB00586], via chemical modification in effort to improve the gastrointestinal tolerability of the drug. It is a more commonly prescribed drug in Europe.Aceclofenac is a NSAID that inhibits both isoforms of COX enzyme, a key enzyme involved in the inflammatory cascade. COX-1 enzyme is a constitutive enzyme involved in prostacyclin production and protective functions of gastric mucosa whereas COX-2 is an inducible enzyme involved in the production of inflammatory mediators in response to inflammatory stimuli. Aceclofenac displays more selectivity towards COX-2 (IC50 of 0.77uM) than COX-1 (IC50 of >100uM), which promotes its gastric tolerance compared to other NSAIDs. The primary metabolite, 4'-hydroxyaceclofenac, also minimally inhibits COX-2 with IC50 value of 36uM [A19667]. Although the mode of action of aceclofenac is thought to mainly arise from the inhibition of synthesis of prostaglandins (PGE2), aceclofenac also inhibits the production of inflammatory cytokines, interleukins (IL-1β, IL-6), and tumor necrosis factors (TNF) [A19666, A19667]. It is also reported that aceclofenac also affects the cell adhesion molecules from neutrophils [A19673]. Aceclofenac also targets the synthesis of glycosaminoglycan and mediates chrondroprotective effects [A19666]. Through COX-2 inhibition, aceclofenac downregulates the production of various inflammatory mediators including prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1β, and TNF from the arachidonic acid (AA) pathway. Inhibition of IL-6 is thought to be mediated by diclofenac converted from aceclofenac [A19671]. Suppressed action of inflammatory cytokines decreases the production of reactive oxygen species. Aceclofenac is shown to decreased production of nitrous oxide in human articular chondrocytes [A19667]. In addition, aceclofenac interferes with neutrophil adhesion to endothelium by decreasing the expression of L-selectin (CD62L), which is a cell adhesion molecule expressed on lymphocytes [A19673]. Aceclofenac is proposed to stimulate the synthesis of glycosaminoglycan in human osteoarthritic cartilage which may be mediated through its inhibitory action on IL-1 production and activity [A19666]. The chrondroprotective effects are generated by 4'-hydroxyaceclofenac which suppresses IL-1 mediated production of promatrix metalloproteinase-1 and metalloproteinase-3 and interferes with the release of proteoglycan from chrondrocytes [A19666, A19667, A19672].

The presence of long chains of conjugated double bonds donates beta-carotene with specific colors.[T162] It is the most abundant form of carotenoid and it is a precursor of the vitamin A. Beta-carotene is composed of two retinyl groups. It is an antioxidant that can be found in yellow, orange and green leafy vegetables and fruits.[T158] Under the FDA, beta-carotene is considered as a generally recognized as safe substance (GRAS).[L2191]Oral administration of beta-carotene increases the serum concentration of beta-carotene by 60% but it does not change the concentration found in the heart, liver or kidneys.[T159] In vitro studies in hepatocytes have shown that beta-carotene ameliorates oxidative stress, enhances antioxidant activity and decreases apoptosis.[T161]    Other than the antioxidant activities, some other actions have been correlated to beta-carotene. It is thought to have detoxifying properties, as well as to help increase resistance to inflammation and infection and increase immune response and enhance RNA production.[L2202]Beta-carotene is an antioxidant that presents significant efficacy against the reactive oxygen species singlet oxygen.[T159] Beta-carotene acts as a scavenger of lipophilic radicals within the membranes of every cell compartments. It also presents an oxidative modification of LDL.[T160] The presence of long chains of conjugated double bonds is responsible for its antioxidative properties by allowing beta-carotene to chelate oxygen-free radicals and dissipate their energy.[T162] The chelation of free radicals inhibits the peroxidation of lipids.[T163]    The effect of beta-carotene in the immune response is thought to be related to the direct effect on the thymus which increases the production of immune cells.[L2202]"
1176,"Betaine is indicated for the treatment of homocystinuria in pediatric and adult patients to decrease elevated homocysteine blood levels.[L43105] Included within the category of homocystinuria are deficiencies or defects in cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), and cobalamin cofactor metabolism (cbl).[L43105]Betaine is a methyl group donor that functions in the normal metabolic cycle of methionine. It is a naturally occurring choline derivative commonly ingested through diet, with a role in regulating cellular hydration and maintaining cell function.[A252235,A252240] Homocystinuria is an inherited disorder that leads to the accumulation of homocysteine in plasma and urine. Currently, no treatments are available to correct the genetic causes of homocystinuria. However, in order to normalize homocysteine levels, patients can be treated with vitamin B6 ([pyridoxine]), vitamin B12 ([cobalamin]), [folate] and specific diets.[L43115] Betaine reduces plasma homocysteine levels in patients with homocystinuria.[L43105] Although it is present in many food products, the levels found there are insufficient to treat this condition. The FDA and EMA have approved the product Cystadane (betaine anhydrous, oral solution) for the treatment of homocystinuria,[L43105,L43115] and the EMA has approved the use of Amversio (betaine anhydrous, oral powder).[L43110]Betaine decreases plasma homocysteine concentrations in homocystinuria cases caused by deficiencies or defects in cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), and cobalamin cofactor metabolism (cbl).[L43105] The decrease of homocysteine is estimated to be 20-30% of pre-treatment levels. Betaine supplementation in patients with homocystinuria also improves metabolic abnormalities in cerebrospinal fluid.[L43110] Reports have shown that depending on the type of homocystinuria, the therapeutic effectiveness of betaine alone may be limited, insufficient to decrease total homocysteine levels and prevent clinical symptoms. In patients with homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency, betaine should be used when serum total homocysteine levels remain high despite dietary therapy.[A7038]    Patients taking betaine for several years do not show evidence of tolerance. Also, betaine concentrations are not correlated with homocysteine concentrations.[L43105] In patients with MTHFR deficiency and cbl defects, betaine may increase methionine and S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) plasma levels. Patients with CBS deficiency without a dietary restriction of methionine may accumulate excessive amounts of methionine. Clinical data shows that in patients with CBS deficiency, increased plasma methionine levels were associated with cerebral edema.[L43105,L43110]Homocystinuria is a hereditary disorder characterized by high levels of the amino acid homocysteine. This condition can be caused by deficiencies or defects in cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), and cobalamin cofactor metabolism (cbl).[L43105] CBS converts homocysteine to cystathionine, and a deficiency in this enzyme can lead to an accumulation of homocysteine. MTHFR is responsible for producing 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, a methyl donor that participates in the conversion of homocysteine back to methionine; therefore, an MTHFR deficiency can also lead to homocystinuria.[A252240] Additionally, a defect in cobalamin (vitamin B12) cofactor metabolism can lead to homocystinuria, since a metabolite of cobalamin (methylcobalamin) promotes the conversion of homocysteine to methionine.[A252235]     Betaine transfers a methyl group via the enzyme betaine homocysteine methyl transferase (BHMT), converting homocysteine back into methionine and dimethylglycine (DMG).[A252240,L43110] In patients with homocystinuria, betaine reduces homocysteine levels and improves health outcomes.[A252235]"
1177,"Indicated for the local treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), when other therapy has been ineffective or is considered unsuitable [FDA Label, L1428].Fomivirsen is a antisense 21 mer phosphorothioate oligonucleotide. It is an antiviral agent that was used in the treatment of cytomegalovirus retinitis (CMV) in immunocompromised patients, including those with AIDS. As a complementary nucleotide to the messenger RNA of the major immediate-early region proteins of human cytomegalovirus, it disrupts the replication of the virus through an antisense mechanism [L1428]. It was discovered by scientists at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and was first developed by Isis Pharmaceuticals and subsequently licensed to Novartis [A31990]. The drug was withdrawn by the FDA because while there was a high unmet need for drugs to treat CMV when the drug was initially discovered and developed due to the CMV arising in people with AIDS, the development of HAART dramatically reduced the number of cases of CMV. Fomivirsen is marketed under the trade name Vitravene for intravitreal injection and was the first antisense drug to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Fomivirsen is an antiviral agent that inhibits CMV replication in a dose-dependent manner with a mean 50% inhibitory concentration between 0.03 and 0.2 μM in a number of in vitro cell lines [A31989]. In human fibroblast cell lines, the median effective inhibitory concentration (EC50) of fomivirsen for virus antigen production was approximately 0.34±0.25 μM [L1428]. In a clinical trial, administration of fomivirsen in patients with newly diagnosed CMV retinitis resulted in an increased median time to disease progression in the immediate treatment group versus delayed treatment group [L1428].Fomivirsen is a phosphorothioate oligonucleotide that inhibits the replication of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) through an antisense mechanism. The nucleotide sequence is complementary to a sequence in mRNA transcripts of the major immediate early region 2 (IE2) of human CMV, which encodes several proteins responsible for regulation of viral gene expression that are essential for viral replication [L1428]. The IE2 gene is essential for early viral gene expression and viral replication [A32006]; it was shown that the IE2 gene transactivate most human CMV promoters [A32009]. Protein product from the IE2 region also acts as autorepressor that represses transcription of the IE1 and IE2 genes by binding the cis repression sequence (CRS) [A32006]. It is proposed that the IE2 region interacts with multiple basal and general transcription factors, as well as cell cycle regulators, and it also plays a critical role in controlling the entry of the virus into the lytic cycle from the latent state to further potentiate the infection cascade [A32009]. Upon binding to the target mRNA, fomivirsen inhibits the IE2 protein synthesis and disrupts viral replication [L1428]. "

Tetryzoline is found in a wide array of over-the-counter eye drops, including the most common brand, Visine.[L32579] Tetryzoline is also found in combination products with other lubricants and anti-irritants, such as [povidone], [polyethylene glycol 400], [dextran], and [zinc sulfate].[L32584, L32589, L32594] It is also used in combination with other drug classes, such as antihistamines, corticosteroids, and glucocorticoids in other countries. Tetryzoline is also found in nasal spray under the trade name Tyzine, which is used for decongestion of nasal and nasopharyngeal mucosa.[L32599]    As it causes profound sedation in children and adults, tetryzoline is increasingly becoming scrutinized for possible drug overdose and toxicity from accidental ingestion.[A7045, A231769] It has also been misused for non-therapeutic purposes as a causative drug for several cases of drug-facilitated sexual assault.[A231764]Tetryzoline is a sympathomimetic amine and an alpha-adrenergic agonist with vasoconstricting and decongestant properties. It works by constricting the smaller arterioles of the nasal passages [L32599] and conjunctival blood vessels to ameliorate allergic rhinitis, nasal congestion, and ocular irritation.[A231764] Tetryzoline is known to cross the blood-brain barrier to work on alpha-2 adrenoceptors and imidazole receptors,[A231764] causing effects like hypotension, bradycardia, analgesia, hypothermia, sedation, and hypnosis.[A231764]Adrenergic receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) that regulate vascular tone: stimulation of alpha-1 adrenergic receptors leads to vasoconstriction. Ocular redness and nasal congestion often result from vasodilation of nasal, conjunctival, and corneal capillary blood vessels.[A231774] Activation of alpha-1 adrenergic receptors have been therefore associated with a reduction of symptoms of ocular irritation and nasal congestion.[A228533] Tetryzoline is a selective agonist of alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, causing vasoconstriction and alleviating ocular and nasal symptoms.[A231774]"

1180,"1. Expectorant in cough syrups.  2. The ammonium ion (NH4+) in the body plays an important role in the maintenance of acid-base balance. The kidney uses ammonium (NH4+) in place of sodium (Na+) to combine with fixed anions in maintaining acid-base balance, especially as a homeostatic compensatory mechanism in metabolic acidosis.  The therapeutic effects of Ammonium Chloride depend upon the ability of the kidney to utilize ammonia in the excretion of an excess of fixed anions and the conversion of ammonia to urea by the liver, thereby liberating hydrogen (H+) and chloride (Cl–) ions into the extracellular fluid.  Ammonium Chloride Injection, USP, after dilution in isotonic sodium chloride injection, may be indicated in the treatment of patients with:   (1) hypochloremic states and (2) metabolic alkalosis.Ammonium chloride is an inorganic compound with the formula NH4Cl. It is highly soluble in water producing mildly acidic solutions.Systemic acidifier. In liver ammonium chloride is converted into urea with the liberation of hydrogen ions ( which lowers the pH) and chloride. Ammonium chloride increases acidity by increasing the amount of hydrogen ion concentrations.    Ammonium chloride can be used as an expectorant due to its irritative action on the bronchial mucosa. This effect causes the production of respiratory tract fluid which in order facilitates the effective cough."

Mean residence time in the conjunctiva was 4.7 hours. Besifloxacin is a bactericidal fluroquinolone-type antibiotic that inhibits bacterial enzymes, DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. By inhibiting DNA gyrase, DNA replication, transcription, and repair is impaired. By inhibiting topoisomerase IV, decatenation during cell devision is impaired. Inhibiting these two targets also slows down development of resistance. "
1183,"[L47376, L47381]Cabazitaxel is a taxoid synthesized from 10-deacetylbaccatin III, a compound isolated from the yew tree.[A260621] As a second-generation semisynthetic microtubule inhibitor, cabazitaxel stabilizes microtubules and induces tumour cell death.[A7056] Due to its low affinity for the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux pump, cabazitaxel can more readily penetrate the blood–brain barrier compared to other taxanes like [paclitaxel] and [docetaxel].[A7056, A260421, A260621]    Cabazitaxel is used to treat metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. It was first approved by the FDA on June 17, 2010.[A260421] It was also approved by the EMA on March 17, 2011 [L47381] and Health Canada on December 17, 2019.[L47376]Cabazitaxel demonstrates a broad spectrum of antitumour activity against advanced human tumours xenografted in mice, including intracranial human glioblastomas.[L47376] Cabazitaxel has a low affinity to P-glycoprotein, allowing it to penetrate the blood-brain barrier without being subject to extensive P-gp-mediated active efflux.[A260421, A260621] Cabazitaxel works against docetaxel-sensitive tumours and tumour models resistant to docetaxel and other chemotherapy drugs.[A260621, L47376]Microtubules are cytoskeletal polymers that regulate cell shape, vesicle transport, cell signalling, and cell division. They are made up of alpha-tubulin and beta-tubulin heterodimers. Microtubules extend toward the mitotic spindle during mitosis to allow the separation and distribution of chromosomes during cell division.[A7056] Cabazitaxel binds to the N-terminal amino acids of the beta-tubulin subunit and promotes microtubule polymerization while simultaneously inhibiting disassembly: this results in the stabilization of microtubules, preventing microtubule cell division. Cabazitaxel ultimately blocks mitotic and interphase cellular functions and tumour proliferation.[A7056, L47366]"
1184,"The capsaicin 8% patch is indicated in the treatment of neuropathic pain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia. There are multiple topical capsaicin formulations available, including creams and solutions, indicated for temporary analgesia in muscle and join pain as well as neuropathic pain. Capsaicin is most often used as a topical analgesic and exists in many formulations of cream, liquid, and patch preparations of various strengths; however, it may also be found in some dietary supplements. Capsaicin is a naturally-occurring botanical irritant in chili peppers, synthetically derived for pharmaceutical formulations. The most recent capsaicin FDA approval was Qutenza, an 8% capsaicin patch dermal-delivery system, indicated for neuropathic pain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia.Capsaicin is a TRPV1 receptor agonist. TRPV1 is a trans-membrane receptor-ion channel complex activated by temperatures higher than 43 degrees Celsius, pH lower than 6, and endogenous lipids. When activated by a combination of these factors, the channel can transiently open and initiate depolarization due to the influx of calcium and sodium ions. Because TRPV1 is commonly expressed in A-delta and mostly C fibers, depolarization results in action potentials which send impulses to the brain and spinal cord. These impulses result in capsaicin effects of warming, tingling, itching, stinging, or burning.  Capsaicin also causes more persistent activation of these receptors compared to the environmental agonists, resulting in a loss of response to many sensory stimuli, described as ""defunctionalization"". Capsaicin is associated with many enzymatic, cytoskeletal, and osmotic changes, as well as disruption of mitochondrial respiration, impairing nociceptor function for extended periods of time. Capsaicin has been shown to reduce the amount of substance P associated with inflammation - however this is not believed to be its main mechanism in the relief of pain [A32319]. Capsaicin's mechanism of action is attributed to ""defunctionalization"" of nociceptor fibers by inducing a topical hypersensitivity reaction on the skin. This alteration in pain mechanisms is due to many of the following: temporary loss of membrane potential, inability to transport neurotrophic factors leading to altered phenotype, and reversible retraction of epidermal and dermal nerve fiber terminals.

1185,"Chenodiol is indicated for patients with radiolucent stones in well-opacifying gallbladders, in whom selective surgery would be undertaken except for the presence of increased surgical risk due to systemic disease or age. Chenodiol will not dissolve calcified (radiopaque) or radiolucent bile pigment stones.Chenodeoxycholic acid (or Chenodiol) is an epimer of ursodeoxycholic acid (DB01586). Chenodeoxycholic acid is a bile acid naturally found in the body. It works by dissolving the cholesterol that makes gallstones and inhibiting production of cholesterol in the liver and absorption in the intestines, which helps to decrease the formation of gallstones. It can also reduce the amount of other bile acids that can be harmful to liver cells when levels are elevated.It acts by reducing levels of cholesterol in the bile, helping gallstones that are made predominantly of cholesterol to dissolve. Chenodeoxycholic acid is ineffective with stones of a high calcium or bile acid content.Chenodiol suppresses hepatic synthesis of both cholesterol and cholic acid, gradually replacing the latter and its metabolite, deoxycholic acid in an expanded bile acid pool. These actions contribute to biliary cholesterol desaturation and gradual dissolution of radiolucent cholesterol gallstones in the presence of a gall-bladder visualized by oral cholecystography. Bile acids may also bind the the bile acid receptor (FXR) which regulates the synthesis and transport of bile acids. "
1186,"Dalteparin is used as a prophylaxis for deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolisms in patients undergoing general surgery (e.g., abdominal, gynecologic, urologic), and in patients with acute medical conditions (e.g. cancer, bed rest, heart failure, severe lung disease). It is also used in patients who have severely restricted mobility, which poses a risk for thromboembolic complications.The patients who undergo this treatment combination have unstable angina or non-ST-segment elevation/non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (i.e., non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes).    It is also used in the prevention of clotting during hemodialysis and hemofiltration in connection with acute renal failure or chronic renal insufficiency.Dalteparin, a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) prepared by nitrous acid degradation of unfractionated heparin of porcine intestinal mucosa origin, is an anticoagulant. It is composed of strongly acidic sulphated polysaccharide chains with an average molecular weight of 5000 and about 90% of the material within the range of 2000-9000. LMWHs have a more predictable response, a greater bioavailability, and a longer anti-Xa half life than unfractionated heparin. Dalteparin can also be safely used in most pregnant women. Low molecular weight heparins are less effective at inactivating factor IIa due to their shorter length compared to unfractionated heparin.Dalteparin has an antithrombin binding site that is essential for high affinity binding to the plasma protein antithrombin (ATIII). Anti-Xa activity of plasma is used as both as an estimate of clotting activity, and as a basis to determine dosage. Its use should be avoided in patients with a creatinine clearance less than 20mL/min. In these patients, unfractionated heparin should only be used. As for monitoring, active partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) will only increase at high doses of low molecular weight heparins (LMWH). Therefore, monitoring aPTT is not recommended. However, anti-Xa activity can be measured to monitor the efficacy of the LMWH. Dalteparin potentiates the activity of ATIII, inhibiting the formation of both factor Xa and thrombin. The main difference between dalteparin and unfractionated heparin (UH) is that dalteparin preferentially inactivates factor Xa. As a result, only a slight increase in clotting time [(i.e. activated partial thomboplastin time (APTT)] is observed relative to UH. For this same reason, APTT is not used to monitor the effects of dalteparin except as an indicator for overdosage. "
1187,"For the treatment of inflammation and pain associated with ocular surgery.Difluprednate is a topical corticosteroid indicated for the treatment of infammation and pain associated with ocular surgery. It is a butyrate ester of 6(α), 9(α)-difluoro prednisolone acetate. Difluprednate is abbreviated DFBA, or difluoroprednisolone butyrate acetate. It is indicated for treatment of endogenous anterior uveiti.Difluprednate is a corticosteroid used as an anti-inflammatory steroidal drug used primarily in ocular surgery.Corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins (lipocortins). It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of infammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2."

Histrelin implants are non-biodegradable, diffusion-controlled, hydrogel polymer reservoirs containing histrelin acetate that need to be replaced every 52 weeks.[L41700,L41715,L41755]    Initially, histrelin implants were developed to reduce testosterone to castration levels in patients with advanced prostate cancer.[L41715] The Vantas product was approved by the FDA in October 2004 for the palliative treatment of this condition.[L41715] Vantas was later discontinued by Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. on September 21, 2021.[L41710]    GnRH agonists are the first line of treatment for children with central precocious puberty (CPP) due to their capacity to reduce LH levels and the concentration of sex steroids. As the product Supprelin LA, histrelin is indicated for the treatment of CPP in children (approved by the FDA in May 2007).[L41700]Histrelin inhibits gonadotropin secretion through the reversible down-regulation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptors in the pituitary gland and desensitization of the pituitary gonadotropes.[L41700,L41715] In pediatric patients with central precocious puberty (CPP), long-term treatment with histrelin acetate suppresses the luteinizing hormone (LH) response to GnRH, causing LH levels to decrease to prepubertal levels within one month of treatment.[L41700] This reduces ovarian and testicular steroidogenesis and slows down linear growth velocity, improving the chance of attaining predicted adult height.[L41700] When given orally, histrelin acetate is not active.[L41715]    Both histrelin products (Vantas and Supprelin LA from Endo Pharmaceuticals) cause a transient increase in serum concentrations of estradiol in females and testosterone in both sexes during the first week of treatment.[L41700,L41715] Laboratory tests are also recommended in order to monitor hormone levels. For pediatric patients with central precocious puberty (CPP) using histrelin (Supprelin LA, Endo Pharmaceuticals), LH, follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol or testosterone should be monitored.[L41700] In patients with advanced prostate cancer using histrelin (Vantas, Endo Pharmaceuticals), testosterone and prostate-specific antigen should be measured periodically.[L41715] Issues such as breakage during insertion and difficulty locating and removing implants have been reported.[L41700,L41715]     The Supprelin LA (Endo Pharmaceuticals) product label alerts users about psychiatric events, convulsions and cases of pseudotumor cerebri (idiopathic intracranial hypertension) that have been reported in patients receiving GnRH agonists.[L41700] The Vantas (Endo Pharmaceuticals) product label alerts users about cases of spinal cord compression and urinary tract obstruction, and an increased risk of hyperglycemia/diabetes and cardiovascular disease in men receiving GnRH agonists.[L41715]Histrelin is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist that acts as a potent inhibitor of gonadotropin.[L41700,L41715] GnRH binds to the GnRH receptor located on the pituitary gonadotrophs, and this leads to the production of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), as well as the regulation of sexual maturation and reproductive function.[A248200]    When administered as an implant, histrelin is delivered in continuous therapeutic doses.[L41700,L41715] As a GnRH agonist, this drug binds and, at first, activates the GnRH receptor. This increases the circulating levels of LH and FSH, leading to a transient increase in the concentration of gonadal steroids (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in males and estrone and estradiol in premenopausal females).[L41700,L41715] However, the continuous administration of histrelin induces the reversible down-regulation of the GnRH receptor and the desensitization of pituitary gonadotropes, which reduce LH and FSH levels.[L41700,L41715]    Pediatric patients with central precocious puberty (CPP) have a lower height potential. When treated with histrelin, LH levels in CPP are lowered, reducing the concentration of sex steroids.[A7088,L41700] In adult males with advanced prostate cancer, histrelin reduces testosterone production to castration levels, hindering the growth of prostate cancer cells.[A18505,A18506,L41715]"
1190,"Hydroxyprogesterone caproate was previously indicated in the US for the prevention of spontaneous preterm births in singleton pregnancies in women with a history of spontaneous preterm birth.

Hydroxyprogesterone caproate was previously marketed under the trade name Delalutin by Squibb, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1956 and withdrawn from marketing in 1999.[L46118] The U.S. FDA approved Makena from KV Pharmaceutical (previously named as Gestiva) on February 4, 2011 for prevention of preterm delivery in women with a history of preterm delivery, sparking a pricing controversy.    In April 2023, the FDA withdrew its approval of Makena and its generics given an unfavorable risk-to-benefit assessment.[L46113]No specific pharmacodynamic studies have been performed to assess hydroxyprogesterone caproate injections. However, the mechanism of action is likely related to increased interaction between progesterone and progesterone receptors.The mechanism by which progesterone prevents preterm birth is not well understood, but many pathways are likely involved. Progesterone plays a vital role in regulation of the female reproductive system and is important for successful implantation of the embryo and maintenance of pregnancy. It acts by binding to progesterone receptors in the uterus, ovaries, breasts and in the central nervous system. These receptors exist in 2 isoforms, PR-A and PR-B. Progesterone binding to these receptors ultimately leads to regulation of gene transcription. This results in an anti-inflammatory effect which blunts the proinflammatory state that occurs with initiation of labor, and maintains uterine queiscence by stabilizing progesterone acting on the myometrium."

Povidone-iodine aqueous solution has strong pharmacological activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, syphilis, hepatitis B virus, HIV, and Trichomonas vaginalis.  Povidone iodine gel is a gynecological topical semi-mobile colloidal agent made by povidone iodine and hydrophilic matrix. It is a system for maintaining its sustained release. Owing to the continuous release of free iodine, it can enable the skin and mucous membranes to maintain a certain effective concentration of iodine for killing bacteria. It is mainly used for gynecological vaginal infection. It exerted its effect through being miscible with vaginal secretions and further killing the inside pathogenic microorganisms, and thus blocking the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and invasion, as well as treating other infected vaginal diseases caused by other kinds of bacteria.     Published reports on the in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of iodophors demonstrate that iodophors are bactericidal, mycobactericidal, and virucidal but can require prolonged contact times to kill certain fungi and bacterial spores. Three brands of povidone-iodine solution have demonstrated more rapid kill (seconds to minutes) of S. aureus and M. chelonae at a 1:100 dilution than did the stock solution. The virucidal activity of 75–150 ppm available iodine was demonstrated against seven viruses. Other investigators have questioned the efficacy of iodophors against poliovirus in the presence of organic matter and rotavirus in distilled or tapwater. Manufacturers' data demonstrate that commercial iodophors are not sporicidal, but they are tuberculocidal, fungicidal, virucidal, and bactericidal at their recommended use-dilution.Povidone-iodine is called iodophore which means povidone acts as a carrier of iodine. Iodine is considered as the active moiety that mediates microbicidal actions. When released from the complex, free iodine (I2) penetrates the cell wall of microorganisms quickly, and the lethal effects are believed to result from disruption of protein and nucleic acid structure and synthesis. While the full mechanism of action is not fully elucidated, iodine is thought to inhibit vital bacterial cellular mechanisms and structures, and oxidizes nucleotides fatty or amino acids in bacterial cell membranes [A32992]. Additionally, free iodine disrupts the function of the cytosolic enzymes involved in the respiratory chain, causing them to become denatured and deactivated [A32992]. _In vitro_ evidence suggests that iodine also counteracts inflammation elicited by both pathogens and the host response via multifactorial effects. In hosts, povidone-iodine was demonstrated to modulate the redox potential, inhibit the release of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α and β-galactosidase, inhibit metalloproteinase production, and potentiate the healing signals from pro-inflammatory cytokines by activation of monocytes, T-lymphocytes, and macrophages, _in vitro_ [A32992]."
1200,"Pralatrexate is indicated for the treatment of relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma.[L37674]Pralatrexate is an antifolate for the treatment of relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma [L37674]. Pralatrexate was developed in response due to the inferior responses of patients using the standard therapy for their B-cells counterparts.[A246693] Compared to methotrexate, pralatrexate has better accumulation in cancer cells.[A246693] Pralatrexate is designed to have a higher affinity for the reduced folate carrier, a protein that is overexpressed in malignant cells and is upregulated by oncogenes.[A246703] As such, pralatrexate is thought to have a better therapeutic window compared to other antifolate analogs due to the novel target of RFC.[A246703]    Pralatrexate was approved by the FDA on September 24, 2009.[L37674] It is also being studied for other types of lymphoma and solid malignancy such as non-small-cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and bladder cancer.[A246678]Pralatrexate is a folate analog that inhibits folate metabolism, thus impeding the synthesis of amino acids and nucleic acid.[A246678] Additionally, pralatrexate also competes for enzymatic processing by folyopolyglutamate synthase (FPGS)with folate to increase cellular retention.[A246678] Compared to methotrexate, pralatrexate binds to the reduced folate carrier protein-1 (RFC-1) for cellular uptake with 10-times the affinity and is a more potent substrate for FPGS.[A246693] The Km value for RFC-1 was calculated to be 0.3 μmol/L and 4.8 μmol/L for pralatrexate and methotrexate respectively, while the Km value for FPGS was estimated to be 5.9 and 32.3 µmol/l for pralatrexate and methotrexate respectively[A246693]. As a result, pralatrexate is more cytotoxic and better retained in cancer cells.[A246693]    Due to its anti-folate activity, pralatrexate's main toxicity is manifested as mucositis that can require dose interruption or reduction[A246693,L41559]. In 5 patients with non-small-cell lung carcinoma receiving a supratherapeutic dose of 230 mg/m2, the mean change from pre-injection QTcF interval at the end of infusion was 6.1 ms (90%CI: -0.6, 12.7), and at 1-hour post-injection was 7.8 ms (90%CI: 3.0, 12.6).[L41559] However, no patient exceeded a QTcF of 470 msec and exhibited an absolute increase from baseline in QTcF exceeding 30 msec.[L41559] As well, the study dose far exceeded the target dose for patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma and pralatrexate does not inhibit the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) K+ channel[L41559]. Therefore, pralatrexate uses are unlikely to cause cardiac repolarization delays.[A246678, L41559].    Pralatrexate is a folate analog metabolic inhibitor that competitively inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) selectively in cancer cells overexpressing the reduced folate carrier protein-1 (RFC-1).[L37674] Folate is a water-soluble vitamin required for DNA synthesis and maintenance as well as DNA, RNA, and protein methylation. As cancer cells are rapidly replicating, they require a lot of folates to accommodate an accelerated cell division and DNA and protein modification for cellular transformation.[A246654, A246659] Therefore, interruption with folate metabolism can inhibit tumor growth.[L37674]    Additionally, pralatrexate also undergoes polyglutamylation catalyzed by folyopolyglutamate synthase (FPGS).[L37674] This reaction both increases cellular retention of pralatrexate for extended drug action and impedes the uptake of folate, also a substrate of FPGS, to further inhibit folate metabolism in cancer cells.[A5138] "

1202,"Sulconazole solution 1.0% is indicated for the treatment of tinea cruris and tinea corporis caused by Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Epidermophyton floccosum, and Microsporum canis; and for the treatment of tinea versicolor. Effectiveness has not been proven in tinea pedis (athlete’s foot).[L44592,L44597]Sulconazole, brand name Exelderm, is a broad-spectrum anti-fungal agent available as a topical cream and solution. Sulconazole nitrate, the active ingredient, is an imidazole derivative that inhibits the growth of common pathogenic dermatophytes, making it an effective treatment for tinea cruris and tinea corporis infections.[L44592,L44597] Sulconazole appears to be effective and well-tolerated in the treatment of superficial fungal infections.[A255612]Sulconazole is a broad-spectrum  antifungal that inhibits the growth of dermatophytes, yeasts and other filamentous and dimorphic fungi. The relative inhibition factor (RIF), a measurement that represents a fixed portion of the antigungal dose-response curve, can be determined to measure the inhibitory activity of antifungal drugs. Against pathogenic yeasts such as dermatophytes and Aspergilli, sulconazole had similar RIF values compared to other imidazoles.[A255612] In in vitro conditions, the fungicidal potency of sulconazole depends on its concentration and the growth phase of the inoculum cells. Sulconazole has also shown antibacterial properties in vitro, with inhibitory concentrations (MICs) under 12.5 mg/L against several Staphylococcus species, as well as Streptococcus faecalis and several Gram-positive anaerobes.[A255612]The mechanism of action of sulconazole is not well established; however, it is thought to be similar to other imidazole derivatives.[A7141] The function of imidazoles can be attributed to their structural resemblance to purines essential to metabolism. Imidazoles inhibit lanosterol 14-alpha demethylase, a cytochrome P-450-dependent enzyme in fungi responsible for converting lanosterol to ergosterol. Since ergosterol is required to maintain the integrity of the fungi membrane, the inhibition of lanosterol 14-alpha demethylase leads to increased fungal cellular permeability. Therefore, the use of an imidazole such as sulconazole inhibits fungal growth.[A32287,A255612]"

1204,"Tinzaparin is used for the prevention of postoperative venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery and in patients undergoing general surgery who are at high risk of developing postoperative venous thromboembolism. It is also used for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism. It is indicated for use in preventing clot formation in indwelling intravenous lines for hemodialysis.Tinzaparin is a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), produced by enzymatic depolymerization of unfractionated heparin from porcine intestinal mucosa. It is a heterogeneous mixture of with an average molecular weight between 5500 and 7500 daltons. Tinzaparin is composed of molecules with and without a special site for high affinity binding to antithrombin III (ATIII). This complex greatly accelerates the inhibition of factor Xa. It is an anticoagulant and considered an antithrombotic. Tinzaparin must be given either subcutaneously or parenterally. LMWHs are less effective at inactivating factor IIa due to their shorter length compared to unfractionated heparin.Tinzaparin, like other LMWHs, have a higher anti-Xa activity  than anti-IIa activity. The anti-Xa activity of tinzaparin is 2.0 +/- 0.5 times greater than its to anti-IIa activity. Heparin exhibits approximately equal inhibitory activity against Xa and IIa. Tinzaparin is an anticoagulant that blocks the formation of thrombi. Like all LMWHs, tinzaparin only causes activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) prolongation at higher doses and routine monitoring is not recommended. However, anti-factor Xa levels may be monitored in some conditions such as pregnancy and renal dysfunction. Its use should be avoided in patients with a creatinine clearance less than 20 mL/min. In these patients, unfractionated heparin should be used. Tinzaparin can be used in patients who have a creatinine clearance between 20-30 mL/min, giving it the highest safety threshold for use in renal failure patients compared to all the LMWHs.Tinzaparin binds to the plasma protein antithrombin III, forming a complex with then accelerates the inhibition of factor Xa. Its affinity for factor Xa is 2-4 times greater than that of unbound ATIII. The inactivation of factor Xa in turn will exponentially generation of thrombin (factor IIa) molecules, which is needed to activate fibrinogen to fibrin. The coagulation cascade is inhibited because fibrin cannot be formed in the presence of tinzaparin. Like all LMWH, it cannot be given intramuscularly due to increased risk of hematoma."
1205,"Triptorelin is indicated for the palliative treatment of advanced prostate cancer.Triptorelin is a synthetic decapeptide agonist analog of luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH). Possessing greater potency than endogenous LHRH, triptorelin reversibly represses gonadotropin secretion. After chronic, continuous administration, this agent effects sustained decreases in LH and FSH production and testicular and ovarian steroidogenesis. Serum testosterone concentrations may fall to levels typically observed in surgically castrated men.The first administration of triptorelin is followed by a transient surge of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol,and testosterone.  The time, peak and decline of testosterone in the body varies depending on the dose administered.  This initial surge is often responsible for worsening of prostate cancer symptoms such as urethral or bladder outlet obstruction, bone pain, spinal cord injury and hematuria in the early stages.  A sustained decrease in FSH and LH, and significant reduction of testicular steroidogenesis is usually seen 2-4 weeks post-initiation of therapy.  This result is a reduction of serum testosterone to levels which are typically seen in surgically castrated men.  Ultimately, tissues and functions that require these hormones become inactive.  The effects of triptorelin can usually be reversed once the drug is discontinued.Triptorelin is a synthetic agonist analog of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH).  Animal studies comparing triptorelin to native GnRH found that triptorelin had 13 fold higher releasing activity for luteinizing hormone, and 21-fold higher releasing activity for follicle-stimulating hormone."

1210,"For the treatment of bacterial infection.Sulfamoxole is an antibacterial in the sulfonamide class.Sulfamoxole is a sulfonamide antibiotic. The sulfonamides are synthetic bacteriostatic antibiotics with a wide spectrum against most gram-positive and many gram-negative organisms. However, many strains of an individual species may be resistant. Sulfonamides inhibit multiplication of bacteria by acting as competitive inhibitors of p-aminobenzoic acid in the folic acid metabolism cycle. Bacterial sensitivity is the same for the various sulfonamides, and resistance to one sulfonamide indicates resistance to all. Most sulfonamides are readily absorbed orally. However, parenteral administration is difficult, since the soluble sulfonamide salts are highly alkaline and irritating to the tissues. The sulfonamides are widely distributed throughout all tissues. High levels are achieved in pleural, peritoneal, synovial, and ocular fluids. Although these drugs are no longer used to treat meningitis, CSF levels are high in meningeal infections. Their antibacterial action is inhibited by pus.Sulfamoxole is a competitive inhibitor of the bacterial enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase. This enzyme is needed for the proper processing of para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) which is essential for folic acid synthesis. The inhibited reaction is necessary in these organisms for the synthesis of folic acid."

1216,"Potential in the treatment and the management of acid-reflux disorders (GERD), peptic ulcer disease, heartburn, and acid indigestion.Metiamide is an H-2 receptor antagonist derived from burimamide. It was an intermediate product on the path to developing cimetidine.Metiamide is a histamine H2-receptor antagonist. It reduces basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion and a reduction in gastric volume, acidity, and amount of gastric acid released in response to stimuli including food, caffeine, insulin, betazole, or pentagastrin. Metiamide inhibits many of the isoenzymes of the hepatic CYP450 enzyme system. Other actions of Metiamide include an increase in gastric bacterial flora such as nitrate-reducing organisms.Metiamide binds to an H2-receptor located on the basolateral membrane of the gastric parietal cell, blocking histamine effects. This competitive inhibition results in reduced gastric acid secretion and a reduction in gastric volume and acidity."
1217,"For the treatment of disorders of the upper gastro-intestinal region that are due to an excess of hydrochloric acid in the gastric juice, i.e. duodenal ulcers, benign gastric ulcers. Also for prophylaxis of recurrent gastric and duodenal ulcersRoxatidine acetate is a specific and competitive H2 receptor antagonist. It is currently approved in South Africa under the tradename Roxit.Roxatidine acetate suppresses the effect of histamine on the parietal cells of the stomach (H2-receptor antagonist). This suppressive action is dose-dependent. As a result, the production and secretion, particularly of gastric acid, are reduced. Roxatidine acetate has no antiandrogenic effects and does not influence drug-metabolizing enzymes in the liver.The H2 antagonists are competitive inhibitors of histamine at the parietal cell H2 receptor. They suppress the normal secretion of acid by parietal cells and the meal-stimulated secretion of acid. They accomplish this by two mechanisms: histamine released by ECL cells in the stomach is blocked from binding on parietal cell H2 receptors which stimulate acid secretion, and other substances that promote acid secretion (such as gastrin and acetylcholine) have a reduced effect on parietal cells when the H2 receptors are blocked."
1218,"For the management of hypertension, edema, ventricular tachycardias, and atrial fibrillation.Bopindolol (INN) is an ester prodrug for the beta blocker [pindolol].Bopindolol is a prodrug of pindolol. Pindolol is a non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonist (beta-blocker) which possesses intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) in therapeutic dosage ranges but does not possess quinidine-like membrane stabilizing activity. Pindolol impairs AV node conduction and decreases sinus rate and may also increase plasma triglycerides and decrease HDL-cholesterol levels. Pindolol is nonpolar and hydrophobic, with low to moderate lipid solubility. Pindolol has little to no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and, unlike some other beta-adrenergic blocking agents, pindolol has little direct myocardial depressant activity and does not have an anesthetic-like membrane-stabilizing action.Bopindolol (as pindolol) non-selectively blocks beta-1 adrenergic receptors mainly in the heart, inhibiting the effects of epinephrine and norepinephrine resulting in a decrease in heart rate and blood pressure. By binding beta-2 receptors in the juxtaglomerular apparatus, Pindolol inhibits the production of renin, thereby inhibiting angiotensin II and aldosterone production and therefore inhibits the vasoconstriction and water retention due to angiotensin II and aldosterone, respectively."

Although Tofisopam is not approved for sale in North America, it is approved for use in various countries worldwide, including parts of Europe. The D-enantiomer ([dextofisopam]) is currently in phase II trials in the U.S. for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.Like other benzodiazepines, tofisopam possesses anxiolytic properties but unlike other benzodiazepines it does not have anticonvulsant, sedative, skeletal muscle relaxant, motor skill-impairing or amnestic properties. It enhances the anticonvulsant activity of 1,4-benzodiazepines like diazepam but not sodium valproate, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or phenytoin.Tofisopam does not bind to the benzodiazepine binding site of the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor. One study (Rundfeldt C. et al.) has shown that tofisopam acts as an isoenzyme-selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterases (PDEs) with highest affinity to PDE-4A1 (0.42 μM) followed by PDE-10A1 (0.92 μM), PDE-3 (1.98 μM) and PDE-2A3 (2.11 μM)."

It may be used as initial therapy if a patient is likely to need multiple drugs to achieve blood pressure goals.[L32923]    Azilsartan medoxomil belongs to the angiotensin-receptor blocking (ARB) class of drugs, which are used to decrease the progression of moderate-to-severe albuminuria and prevent the recurrence of atrial fibrillation as off-label uses in patients with diabetes mellitus and hypertension.[A232863]Azilsartan medoxomil is a prodrug that is broken down to azilsartan, which belongs in the angiotensin-receptor blocking (ARB) drug class. It is a selective AT1 subtype angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Azilsartan medoxomil is a relatively recently-developed antihypertensive drug that was first approved by the FDA in February 2011.[A7354] Many guidelines recommend the use of ARBs as first-line therapy when initiating antihypertensive therapy and indicate that the clinical efficacy of ARBs is comparable to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors that are also used as first-line treatment for hypertension.[A232863]    Azilsartan medoxomil is marketed under the brand name Edarbi. It is used to treat hypertension as monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs. It is also available in a combination product with [chlorthalidone]. As hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease,[A7354] early management of hypertension has several implications on patients' survival rate and quality of life in the future. Lowering blood pressure is associated with a reduced risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions.[L32918] Azilsartan medoxomil is thus speculated to lower mortality rates and the onset of cardiovascular disease. Although there is no clinical significance yet determined, azilsartan medoxomil may have potential off-label uses in patients with a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure.[A232863]Pharmacodynamic effects of azilsartan medoxomil are mediated by its active metabolite, azilsartan. Azilsartan inhibits the pressor effects of an angiotensin II infusion in a dose-related manner.[A7354] At a single 32 mg dose, azilsartan inhibited the maximal pressor effect by approximately 90% at peak plasma concentrations and by 60% at 24 hours after administration. In healthy subjects receiving single and repeated doses of azilsartan medoxomil, plasma angiotensin I and II concentrations and plasma renin activity increased, while plasma aldosterone concentrations decreased.[L32918] Like other ARBs, azilsartan causes dose-dependent decrease in peripheral resistance and decreases smooth muscle vascular tone.[A232870] As azilsartan blocks the angiotensin II receptor, the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion is inhibited; however, the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the blood pressure-lowering effect of azilsartan. Blood pressure-lowering effects of antihypertensive agents can be reduced in patients of African descent.[L32918] However, there are no recommended dosage adjustment of azilsartan on the basis of a patient’s sex, race, or degree of renal or hepatic impairment.[A232910]    Azilsartan medoxomil has negligible effects on serum potassium or sodium levels. Azilsartan does not affect the biosynthesis of angiotensin II nor bradykinin levels. It also does not bind to any ion channels that are involved in cardiovascular regulation.[L32918] The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system regulates blood pressure. Angiotensin II is a peptide hormone that is a principal pressor agent in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.[A7354] It is a potent, direct vasoconstrictor that binds to the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1 receptor) to stimulate the synthesis and release of aldosterone and promote cardiac stimulation. Angiotensin II promotes renal tubular reabsorption of sodium, resulting in water retention.[A7354,L32918] It also inhibits further secretion of renin. AT1 receptors are highly expressed in vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland.[A232863]    Azilsartan medoxomil is a prodrug that is hydrolyzed to its active metabolite, azilsartan, in the gastrointestinal tract following oral administration. Azilsartan selectively binds to AT1 receptors as an antagonist, blocking vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II. Azilsartan has more than a 10,000-fold greater affinity for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor, which is predominantly involved in cardiovascular homeostasis.[L32918] Azilsartan appears to dissociate from AT1 receptors much more slowly than other ARBs,[A7356] which explains its longer duration of action when compared to other ARBs.[A232870]"

It is marketed under the name Juxtapid (R).Lomitapide directly inhibits microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP).Within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, lomitapide inhibits microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), which prevents the formation of apolipoprotein B, and, thus, the formation of VLDL and chylomicrons as well. Altogether, this leads to a reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol."
1229,"Vismodegib is indicated for the treatment of adults with metastatic basal cell carcinoma, or with locally advanced basal cell carcinoma that has recurred following surgery or who are not candidates for surgery and who are not candidates for radiation.[L45803]Vismodegib is an orally active small molecule that inhibits the hedgehog signaling pathway by binding to and inhibiting the transmembrane protein smoothened homologue (SMO).[A258613,A258618,L45803] It was discovered by high-throughput screening of a library of small-molecule compounds and subsequent optimization through medicinal chemistry.[A7369] Since it targets the hedgehog signaling pathway, vismodegib has anti-tumor activity in basal-cell carcinoma. The Hedgehog signaling pathway plays an important role in the development of organs and tissues during embryogenesis. Afterwards, it is silenced in all cells and tissues, except for hair, skin and stem cells. However, dysregulated or aberrant Hedgehog signaling has been associated with basal cell carcinoma pathogenesis.[A258608,L45803] In January 2012, vismodegib was approved by the FDA for the treatment of adult basal cell carcinoma. In July 2013, it was approved by the EMA, and since then, it has been approved by several other countries.[A7370,A258618,L45803]Vismodegib selectively binds to and inhibits the transmembrane protein smoothened homologue (SMO) to inhibit the Hedgehog signalling pathway. Following 7 days of 150 mg once-daily dosing, the use of vismodegib was not associated with a clinically significant QT interval prolongation.[L45803] Vismodegib can cause embryo-fetal death or severe birth defects, as well as severe cutaneous adverse reactions and musculoskeletal adverse reactions. In pediatric patients given vismodegib, premature fusion of the epiphyses has been reported.[L45803]During embryogenesis, the Hedgehog signaling pathway plays an important role in cell growth, differentiation apoptosis and self-renewal. After this developmental stage, the Hedgehog signaling pathway is silenced in all cells and tissues, except for hair, skin and stem cells. Mutations on elements of the Hedgehog signaling pathway may result in uncontrolled proliferation of basal skin cells, and dysregulated or aberrant Hedgehog signaling has been associated with the pathogenesis of basal cell carcinoma. Therefore, drugs that target and block this pathway, such as vismodegib, may be used to treat this condition. Vismodegib binds to and inhibits the transmembrane protein smoothened homologue (SMO), a protein that leads to the activation and nuclear translocation of several factors involved in the Hedgehog signaling pathway, inhibiting the activation of downstream Hedgehog target genes.[A258608,L45803]"
1230,"Temocapril is an ACE inhibitor primarily indicated in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure, diabetic nephropathy, and improvement of prognosis for coronary artery diseases (including acute myocardial infarction). Temocapril is a prodrug-type angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor not approved for use in the United States, but is approved in Japan and South Korea. Temocapril can also be used in hemodialysis patients without risk of serious accumulation.Temocapril is a prodrug of its active metabolite (and diacid form) temocaprilat which contains a thiazepine ring. Temocaprilat has slightly higher potency than enalaprilat in ACE inhibition isolated from rabbit lung. ACE inhibitors exert their hemodynamic effect mainly by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system. They also modulate sympathetic nervous system activity and increase prostaglandin synthesis. They cause mainly vasodilation and mild natriuresis without affecting heart rate and contractility.). When compared with other Angiotensin-converting Enzyme Inhibitors, temocapril's advantages include a rapid onset of action and what research suggests is tighter vascular ACE binding than enalaprilat.

1231,"Pitavastatin is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia to reduce elevated total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (Apo B), triglycerides (TG), and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). It is also indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients aged 8 years and older with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) to reduce elevated TC, LDL-C, and Apo B.[L48616]    Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD. Statin-indicated conditions include diabetes mellitus, clinical atherosclerosis (including myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stable angina, documented coronary artery disease, stroke, trans ischemic attack (TIA), documented carotid disease, peripheral artery disease, and claudication), abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and severely elevated LDL-C levels.[A181087, A181406]Pitavastatin, also known as the brand name product Livalo, is a lipid-lowering drug belonging to the statin class of medications. By inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol within the liver, statins lower abnormal cholesterol and lipid levels and ultimately reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid. This is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as ""bad cholesterol""), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]    Pitavastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] Increasing use of the statin class of drugs is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]    While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, [rosuvastatin] is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg [rosuvastatin] per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decrease in LDL cholesterol levels.[A181409,A181535,A181538,A1793] Study data has confirmed that pitavastatin's potency in lowering LDL-C is comparable to that of other statins but also has increased efficacy in increasing HDL-C (also known as ""good cholesterol"").[A182000,A182003,A182006] Despite these differences in potency, several trials have demonstrated only minimal differences in terms of clinical outcomes between statins.[A181538, A181427]Pitavastatin is an oral antilipemic agent which inhibits HMG-CoA reductase. It is used to lower total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apoB), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and trigleride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease and high ratios are associated with higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, rosuvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[A181087, A181406]    Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]    **Skeletal Muscle Effects**    Pitavastatin may cause myopathy (muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness with creatine kinase (CK) above ten times the upper limit of normal) and rhabdomyolysis (with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria). Rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis with statin use, including pitavastatin. Predisposing factors for myopathy include advanced age (≥65 years), female gender, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and renal impairment. In most cases, muscle symptoms and CK increases resolved when treatment was promptly discontinued. As dosages of pitavastatin greater than 4mg per day were associated with an increased risk of severe myopathy, the product monograph recommends a maximum daily dose of 4mg once daily.[L48616]    The risk of myopathy during treatment with pitavstatin may be increased with concurrent administration of interacting drugs such as [fenofibrate], [niacin], [gemfibrozil], and [cyclosporine].  Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors coadministered with [colchicine], and caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing these two medications together.[L48616]    Real-world data from observational studies has suggested that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.[A182258]    **Hepatic Dysfunction**    Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with pitavastatin. In most cases, the elevations were transient and either resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including pitavastatin.[L48616]    Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury.[L48616]    **Increases in HbA1c and Fasting Serum Glucose Levels**    Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with statins, including pitavastatin. Optimize lifestyle measures, including regular exercise, maintaining a healthy body weight, and making healthy food choices.[L48616]    An in vitro study found that [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], and [pitavastatin] exhibited a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on human pancreas islet β cells, with reductions in cell viability of 32, 41, 34 and 29%, respectively, versus control. Moreover, insulin secretion rates were decreased by 34, 30, 27 and 19%, respectively, relative to control.[A182012]Pitavastatin is a statin medication and a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.[A181421] Pitavastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors which increase hepatic uptake of LDL, thereby reducing circulating LDL-C levels.     In vitro and in vivo animal studies also demonstrate that statins exert vasculoprotective effects independent of their lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.[A181424] This includes improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response.    Statins have also been found to bind allosterically to β2 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an important role in leukocyte trafficking and in T cell activation.[A181559]"
1232,"[L1030] The FDA combination therapy approval of rilpivirine and [dolutegravir] is indicated for adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older weighing at least 35 kg with HIV-1 infections whose virus is currently suppressed (< 50 copies/ml) on a stable regimen for at least six months, without a history of treatment failure and no known substitutions associated to resistance to any of the two components of the therapy.[L31193]Rilpivirine is non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) which is used for the treatment of HIV-1 infections in treatment-naive patients.[A31328] It is a diarylpyrimidine derivative.[A31329] The internal conformational flexibility of rilpivirine and the plasticity of it interacting binding site gives it a very high potency and reduces the chance of resistance compared to other NNRTI's.[A31331] Rilpivirine was developed by Tilbotec, Inc. and FDA approved on May 20, 2011.[L1031] Rilpivirine in combination with [cabotegravir] was granted FDA approval on 21 January 2021.[L31193] While previously administered once-monthly only, this combination product was granted FDA approval for dosing every two months on February 01, 2022 [L40084] and without the need for an oral lead-in period prior.[L31193]Rilpivirine is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor that inhibits the replication of HIV-1.[L7069] It has a long duration of action as the oral tablet is given daily and the intramuscular suspension is given monthly.[L7069,L31193] Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of hypersensitivity reactions, hepatotoxicity, depressive disorders, and the redistribution or accumulation of body fat.[L7069]Rilpivirine is a non-competitive NNRTI that binds to reverse transcriptase.[L7069] Its binding results in the blockage of RNA and DNA- dependent DNA polymerase activities, like HIV-1 replication. It does not present activity against human DNA polymerases α, β and γ.[L1032,L7069] Rilpivirine's flexible structure around the aromatic rings allows the adaptation to changes in the non-nucleoside RT binding pocket, reducing the likelihood of viral mutations conferring resistance.[A31335]"
1233,"Crizotinib is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors are anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) or ROS1-positive as detected by an FDA-approved test.[L42460] Crizotinib is also indicated for the treatment of relapsed or refractory, systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) that is ALK-positive in pediatric patients 1 year of age and older and young adults. The safety and efficacy of crizotinib have not been established in older adults with relapsed or refractory, systemic ALK-positive ALCL.[L42460] Additionally, crizotinib is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 1 year of age and older with unresectable, recurrent, or refractory inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) that is ALK-positive.[L42460]Crizotinib is a tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor used for the treatment of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) or ROS1-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors, as well as ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT).[L42460] By targeting the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK fusion protein, crizotinib offers robust effectiveness in treating NSCLC in patients with this type of rearrangement.[A250785] Crizotinib was the first-in-class drug used to treat ALK-positive tumors. Second- and third-generation ALK-tyrosine kinase-inhibitors have overcome many of the pharmacodynamic and genetic resistance mechanisms crizotinib is prone to.[A250785] Crizotinib was approved by the FDA in 2011, and its use is accompanied by FDA-approved tests used to detect ALK and ROS1 rearrangements.[L42460]In a phase I study, 37 patients with a variety of solid-tumor cancers refractory to therapy received 50 to 300 mg of crizotinib daily or twice daily. In this group, two patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) exhibiting echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutations responded to therapy; therefore, following studies focused on patients with advanced ALK-positive disease.[A7418] In this group of patients, the 6-month progression-free survival among crizotinib users was approximately 72%. When compared to ALK mutation-positive patients that did not receive crizotinib, ALK mutation-positive patients treated with crizotinib had a higher two-year overall survival rate (54% vs 36%).[A7418]    The use of crizotinib may lead to hepatotoxicity, interstitial lung disease (ILD), pneumonitis, QT interval prolongation, bradycardia, severe visual loss, ​​embryo-fetal toxicity and gastrointestinal toxicity in pediatric and young adult patients with anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) or pediatric patients with inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT).[L42460]Crizotinib is a tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor that targets anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR, c-MET), ROS1 (c-ros), and Recepteur d'Origine Nantais (RON).[L42460] When activated, ALK inhibits apoptosis and promotes cell proliferation, and ALK-gene translocations can lead to the expression of oncogenic fusion proteins. A small portion of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients have ALK-positive tumors. Most of these cases are characterized by the fusion of ALK with the chimeric protein echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4), resulting in increased kinase activity.[A7418,L42460] Crizotinib inhibits ALK by inhibiting its phosphorylation and creating an inactive protein conformation.[A250785] This ultimately lowers the proliferation of cells carrying this genetic mutation and tumour survivability.[L42460]     _In vitro_ assays on tumor cell lines demonstrated that crizotinib inhibits ALK, ROS1, and c-Met phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner. _In vivo_ studies in mice with tumor xenografts that expressed EML4- or nucleophosmin (NPM)-ALK fusion proteins or c-Met showed that crizotinib has antitumor activity.[L42460]"
1234,"Fingolimod is indicated for the treatment of patients aged 10 and above with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, which may include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, as well as active secondary progressive disease.[L12651,L44346]Multiple sclerosis, or MS, is a devastating inflammatory disease that often progresses and causes severe neurological, physical, and cognitive effects.[A176474] Fingolimod is a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. It was developed by Novartis and initially approved by the FDA in 2010.[L12651] Fingolimod was also studied for the treatment of COVID-19, the disease caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.[L12654,L12657]In multiple sclerosis, fingolimod binds to sphingosine receptors, reducing its associated neuroinflammation.[L12651]In COVID-19, it may reduce lung inflammation and improve the clinical outcomes of patients with this disease.[L12654]     Fingolimod causes a transient reduction in heart rate and AV conduction during treatment initiation. It has the potential to prolong the QT interval.[L12654]       Sphingosine‐1‐phosphate (S1P) is an important phospholipid that binds to various G‐protein‐coupled receptor subtypes, which can be identified as S1P1–5R. S1P and the receptors it binds to perform regular functions in the immune, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and nervous systems.[A189321,A192744] S1P can be expressed ubiquitously, playing an important role in regulating inflammation.  S1P1R, S1P2R, and S1P3R receptors can be found in the cardiovascular, immune, and central nervous systems. S1P4R is found on lymphocytic and hematopoietic cells, while S1P5R expression is found only on the spleen (on natural killer cells) or in the central nervous system.[A189333]    The active form of the drug, fingolimod phosphate, is a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator that exerts its mechanism of action in MS by binding to various sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors (1, 3, 4, and 5). It suppresses the exit of lymphocytes from lymph nodes, leading to a lower level of lymphocytes circulating in the peripheral circulation. This reduces the inflammation that is associated with MS. The mechanism of action of fingolimod is not fully understood but may be related to reduced lymphocyte circulation into the central nervous system.[A176474,L12651]    Immune modulating treatment such as fingolimod is not typically employed for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Despite this, with the tissue findings of pulmonary edema and hyaline membrane formation, the timely use of immune modulators such as fingolimod can be considered to prevent acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with COVID-19.[L12654]"
1235,"It is also indicated for the treatment of cHL post-autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) in patients at high risk of relapse or progression. Finally, it may be used in the treatment of adult patients with cHL who have previously failed either auto-HSCT or at least two prior multi-agent chemotherapy regimens if they are not candidates for auto-HSCT.It may also be used as monotherapy in sALCL after therapeutic failure of a least one prior multi-agent chemotherapy regimen.[L39789]    Brentuximab vedotin is also indicated in the treatment of primary cutaneous large anaplastic large cell lymphoma, or CD30-expressing mycosis fungoides, who have received prior systemic therapy.[L39789]Brentuximab vedotin, also known as Adcetris®, is an antibody-drug conjugate that combines an anti-CD30 antibody with the drug monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). It is an anti-neoplastic agent used in the treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma and systemic anaplastic large-cell lymphoma. Brentuximab vedotin was initially approved in 2011. In January 2012, the drug label was revised with a boxed warning of a condition known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and death due to opportunistic JC virus infection post-treatment.[L1737]    The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Adcetris in March 2018 to treat adult patients with previously untreated stage III or IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) in combination with chemotherapy.[L1737]    Adcetris has also been previously approved by the FDA to treat Hodgkin's lymphoma after relapse, Hodgkin's lymphoma after stem cell transplantation when a patient has a high risk of relapse or progression, systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) after the failure of other treatment regimens, and primary cutaneous ALCL after failure of other treatment regimens.[L1737]    Lymphoma is a malignancy that begins in the lymphatic system, which helps to combat infection and disease. Lymphoma may begin anywhere in the body and can spread to nearby lymph nodes. The two main types of lymphoma are Hodgkin lymphoma (also called Hodgkin disease) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Most individuals with Hodgkin's lymphoma have the classical type. In this type of lymphoma, large, abnormal lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) are found in the lymph nodes called Reed-Sternberg cells. With early diagnosis and intervention, patients with Hodgkin lymphoma normally experience long-term remission.[L1737]    The ECHELON-1 study results demonstrated superior efficacy of the drug combined with a chemotherapy regimen compared to the previous standard of care. Importantly,  bleomycin - a highly toxic agent - was completely removed from the regimen. This demonstrates meaningful progress in treatment for patients affected by this disease.[L1739]Brentuximab vedotin causes apoptosis of tumor cells by preventing cell cycle progression of the G2 to M phase through disruption of the cytosolic microtuble network, thus preventing tumor growth and proliferation.[L39789]    Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is characterized by malignant Reed-Sternberg cells which express CD30, a marker of large cell lymphoma.[A32159] Until March 2018, USA National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for patients with advanced HL (stage III/IV disease) recommend treatment with  adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD), or escalated bleomycin, etoposide, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (BEACOPP) as first-line regimens.[L1740]     ABVD appears to be as effective, with fewer side effects, as escalated BEACOPP. Escalated BEACOPP leads to a greater progression-free survival but no difference in overall survival. Recent progress in technology has enabled a new shift to cancer therapy targeting specific molecules. Brentuximab vedotin, a CD30-directed antibody conjugate, selectively targets malignant HL cells.[A32158]    The effect of Brentuximab vedotin (1.8 mg/kg) on the QTc interval was studied in an open-label, single-group study in 46 patients diagnosed with CD30-expressing hematologic malignancies.  Ingestion of brentuximab vedotin did not prolong the mean cardiac QTc interval >10 ms from baseline levels.  Smaller increases in the mean QTc interval (<10 ms) cannot be ruled out because this study did not include a placebo arm and a positive control arm.[L39789]Brentuximab vedotin is composed of 3 parts: a chimeric human-murine IgG1 that selectively targets CD30, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), which is a microtubule-disrupting agent, and a protease-susceptible linker that links the antibody and MMAE. The IgG1 antibody enables Brentuximab vedotin to target tumor cells expressing CD30 on their surface.  Following this Brentuximab vedotin enters the cell. Once inside, the linker is cleaved releasing MMAE which binds disrupts the microtubule network.[L39789]    The antibody component of this drug is a chimeric IgG1 directed against CD30.  The small molecule, MMAE, is a microtubule-disrupting particle.  MMAE is covalently attached to the antibody by a linker. Data suggest that the anticancer activity of Adcertris is due to the binding of the ADC to CD30-expressing cells, followed by internalization of the ADC-CD30 complex, and the subsequent release of MMAE by proteolytic cleavage.  Binding of MMAE to tubulin disrupts the microtubule network within the cell, inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptotis of the malignant cells [FDA label].  "
1236,"For the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer who have previously received at least two chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of metastatic cancer. Eribulin is a microtubule inhibitor indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer who have previously received at least two chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of metastatic disease. Eribulin was isolated from the marine sponge Halichondria okadai. Eribulin is also being investigated for use in the treatment of advanced solid tumors [A7439].LinearEribulin inhibits the growth phase of microtubules without affecting the shortening phase and sequesters tubulin into nonproductive aggregates. Eribulin exerts its effects via a tubulin-based antimitotic mechanism leading to G2/M cell-cycle block, disruption of mitotic spindles, and, ultimately, apoptotic cell death after prolonged mitotic blockage.

1237,"For the treatment of adult Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN).Gabapentin enacarbil is marketed under the name Horizant. It is a prodrug of gabapentin, and indicated in adults for the treatment of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN).Since gabapentin enacarbil is a prodrug of gabapentin, it's physiological effects are the same as gabapentin. Concerning PHN, gabapentin prevents allodynia and hyperalgesia.  Although the exact mechanism of action of gabapentin in RLS and PHN is unknown, it is presumed to involve the descending noradrenergic system, resulting in the activation of spinal alpha2-adrenergic receptors. "
1238,"Boceprevir is a direct acting antiviral medication used as part of combination therapy to treat chronic Hepatitis C, an infectious liver disease caused by infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as Boceprevir. Boceprevir is an inhibitor of NS3/4A, a serine protease enzyme, encoded by HCV genotypes 1 and 4 [synthesis]. These enzymes are essential for viral replication and serve to cleave the virally encoded polyprotein into mature proteins like NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B [FDA Label]. The barrier for develoment of resistance to NS3/4A inhibitors is lower than that of NS5B inhibitors, another class of DAAs [A19593]. Subtitutions at amino acid positions 155, 156, or 168 are known to confer resistance. The substitutions of the enzyme's catalytic triad consisting of H58, D82, and S139 are also likely to alter the affinity of the drug for NS3/4A or the activity of the enzyme itself. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626].    Boceprevir is available as a fixed dose product (tradename Victrelis). Victrelis is no longer widely used as interferon-free therapies have been developed.Boceprevir is classified as a direct-acting antiviral (DAA) and prevents viral replication in HCV genotype 1 [FDA Label]. Boceprevir is a NS3/4a protease inhibitor used to inhibit viral HCV replication [FDA Label]. NS3/4a protease is an integral part of viral replication and mediates the cleavage the virally encoded polyprotein to mature proteins (NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B) [FDA Label]. Boceprevir covalently but reversibly binds the serine (S139) resiude in the active site via a (α)-ketoamide functional group. This inhibits the proteolytic acitvity of the HCV 1a and 1b encoded enzyme."
1239,"Fidaxomicin is indicated for the treatment of Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile-associated diarrhea in adult and pediatric patients 6 months of age and older.[L11575]    Fidaxomicin should only be used in patients with proven or strongly suspected C. difficile infection to reduce the risk of development of drug-resistant bacteria and maximize the therapeutic effectiveness of fidaxomicin and other antimicrobial agents.[L11575]Fidaxomicin is a novel macrolide antibiotic used in the treatment of diarrhea caused by Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile in adult and pediatric patients over the age of 6 months.[L11575] Fidaxomicin is a naturally-occurring 18-member macrocycle derived from fermentation.[A190501] Because fidaxomicin contains an 18-membered lactone ring in its structure, it is referred to as a macrocyclic lactone antibiotic drug.[A190492] The antibacterial activity of fidaxomicin is distinct from macrolides and rifamycins, as the bactericidal activity is time-dependent, and not concentration-dependent.[A190492] Fidaxomicin was the first macrocyclic lactone antibiotic with activity against C. difficile,[A190486] and it displays a narrow spectrum of activity against gram-positive anaerobes.[A7445] It mediates its potent bactericidal action on the bacteria by inhibiting the bacterial RNA synthase, thereby disrupting bacterial transcription.[A190486] The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90) for fidaxomicin is four times less than that of [vancomycin], which was the primary drug of choice for C. difficile infection before the approval of fidaxomicin.[A190492] Unlike vancomycin, however, fidaxomicin has a negligible effect on normal colonic microflora.[A190516]    The FDA initially approved fidaxomicin in May 2011 for the treatment of C. difficile-associated diarrhea in adult patients over the age of 18.[A190492] Later that year in December, the drug was also approved by the European Medicine Agency.[A190492] In June 2012, fidaxomicin was also granted approval by Health Canada.[A190486] The approved indication of fidaxomicin was expanded by the FDA in January 2020 to include pediatric patients over the age of 6 months in the treatment population.[L11575]Fidaxomicin has a narrow-spectrum antibacterial profile, with potent bactericidal activity specifically against C. difficile.[A190489] The minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of organisms for fidaxomicin against C. difficile ranged from 0.0078 to 2 μg/mL in vitro.[A7445] The bactericidal activity of fidaxomicin is time-dependent.[A190492] Other than C. difficile, fidaxomicin has moderate inhibitory activity against Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus and Enterococcus spp.) [A190489] and poor activity against normal colonic flora, including anaerobes and enteric Gram-negative bacilli.[A190486] Isolates of C. difficile that are resistant to rifamycins or other antimicrobial classes (such as cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, clindamycin) were not shown to be cross-resistant to fidaxomicin.[A190486]Clostridium difficile is a Gram-positive bacterium that causes various gastrointestinal complications, such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea. C. difficile infection can be caused by antibiotic therapy, resulting in the disruption of the human gut flora leads to an overgrowth of C. difficile. The consequences of C. difficile infection can be mild to severe and sometimes fatal.[A190492]     Fidaxomicin gets hydrolyzed to its active metabolite, OP-1118, upon oral administration. Both compounds mediate a bactericidal activity against C. difficile by inhibiting bacterial RNA polymerase at the initiation phase of the transcription cycle.[A190486] The RNA polymerase is an essential bacterial enzyme that regulates gene expression, catalyzes nucleic acid interactions, and promotes several bacterial enzymatic reactions critical for bacterial survival.[A190486] The core RNA polymerase is composed of a complex of different subunits and contains the active site.[A190531] To initiate bacterial transcription, the active site of the core RNA polymerase binds to a promoter-specificity σ initiation factor, which locates and binds to a promoter region of the DNA. The DNA-RNA polymerase interaction promotes subsequent steps of transcription, which involves the separation of DNA strands.[A7444] Fidaxomicin binds to the DNA template-RNA polymerase complex, thereby preventing the initial separation of DNA strands during transcription and inhibiting messenger RNA synthesis.[A190486] The narrow spectrum of antimicrobial activity of fidaxomicin may be explained by the unique target site of fidaxomicin and differing σ subunits of the core structure of RNA polymerase among bacterial species.[A190486] "
1240,"Cabozantinib is indicated for the treatment of progressive, metastatic medullary thyroid cancer.[L15123] It is also indicated for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma and for hepatocellular carcinoma in patients previously treated with sorafenib.[L15128,L15133]Cabozantinib was first approved in 2012 and is a non-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It was initially approved in the US under the brand name Cometriq, which is indicated for the treatment of metastatic medullary thyroid cancer.[L15123] In 2016, a capsule formulation (Cabometyx) was approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma, and this same formulation gained additional approval in both the US and Canada in 2019 for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma in previously treated patients.[L15128,L15133]Cabozantinib suppresses metastasis, angiogenesis, and oncognesis by inhibiting receptor tyrosine kinases.Cabozantinib inhibits specific receptor tyrosine kinases such as VEGFR-1, -2 and -3, KIT, TRKB, FLT-3, AXL, RET, MET, and TIE-2."
1241,"Ruxolitinib is indicated for the treatment of the following conditions:    - intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis (MF), including prima1y MF, post-polycythemia vera MF and post-essential thrombocythemia MF in adults.[L31938] It is also used to treat disease-related splenomegaly or symptoms in adult patients with these conditions.[L32073]   - polycythemia vera (PV) in adults who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant of hydroxyurea.[L31938]  - steroid-refracto1y acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older.[L31938]  - chronic GVHD in patients aged 12 years and older who have failed one or two lines of systemic therapy.[L31938]    Topical ruxolitinib is indicated for:    - the short-term and non-continuous chronic treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in non-immunocompromised patients patients 12 years of age and older whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when those therapies are not advisable.[L39125]  - the treatment of non-segmental vitiligo in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older.[L39125, L46068]Ruxolitinib, formerly known as INCB018424 or INC424, is an anticancer drug and a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. It is a potent and selective inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2,[A229698] which are tyrosine kinases involved in cytokine signalling and hematopoiesis.[A7450] Myeloproliferative neoplasms, such as myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera, are often characterized by aberrant activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, leading to abnormal blood cell counts and thrombotic complications. By inhibiting JAK1 and JAK2, ruxolitinib works to block the dysregulated cell signalling pathways and prevents abnormal blood cell proliferation.[A229708] Due to a large number of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms who have JAK2 mutations, ruxolitinib was the first ATP-competitive inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2 ever developed.[A229938]    Ruxolitinib was first approved for the treatment of adult patients with myelofibrosis by the FDA in 2011, followed by EMA's approval in 2012.[A229708] In 2014, it was approved for the treatment of polycythemia vera in adults who have an inadequate response to or are intolerant of [hydroxyurea] and in 2019, ruxolitinib was approved for use in steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease in adults and children.[L31958] The topical formulation of ruxolitinib is used to treat atopic dermatitis and vitiligo.[L39125] It is being investigated for other inflammatory skin conditions.[A229883]    Ruxolitinib has been investigated to treat patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) accompanied by severe systemic hyperinflammation. In phase II clinical trials, ruxolitinib improved chest computed tomography and improved recovery in patients with lymphopenia.[A229713, A229718] However, phase III clinical trials later determined that ruxolitinib was inadequate in meeting its primary endpoint of reducing the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients who experienced severe complications [L31968] thus the drug was not approved as a treatment for COVID-19.Ruxolitinib is an antineoplastic agent that inhibits cell proliferation, induces apoptosis of malignant cells, and reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine plasma levels by inhibiting JAK-induced phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT).[A229703] Inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation, which is used as a marker of JAK activity, [A7450] by ruxolitinib is achieved at two hours after dosing which returned to near baseline by 10 hours in patients with myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera.[L31938] In clinical trials, ruxolitinib reduced splenomegaly and improved symptoms of myelofibrosis.[A229703] In a mouse model of myeloproliferative neoplasms, administration of ruxolitinib was associated with prolonged survival.[A7450] Ruxolitinib inhibits both mutant and wild-type JAK2 [A229703]; however, JAK2V617F mutation, which is often seen in approximately 50% of patients with myelofibrosis, was shown to reduce ruxolitinib sensitivity, which may also be associated with possible resistance to JAK inhibitor treatment.[A229933]The Janus kinase (JAK) family of protein tyrosine kinases comprises JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and non-receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2).[A229703] JAKs play a pivotal role in intracellular signalling pathways of various cytokines and growth factors essential to hematopoiesis, such as interleukin, erythropoietin, and thrombopoietin.[A7450] JAKs have diverse functions: JAK1 and JAK3 promote lymphocyte differentiation, survival, and function, while JAK2 promotes signal transduction of erythropoietin and thrombopoietin.[A229703, A229753] JAKs are in close proximity to the cytokine and growth factor receptor’s cytoplasmic region. Upon binding of cytokines and growth factors, JAKs are activated, undergoing cross-phosphorylation and tyrosine phosphorylation. This process also reveals selective binding sites for STATs, which are DNA-binding proteins that also bind to the cytoplasmic region of cytokine or growth factor receptors. Activated JAKs and STATs translocate to the nucleus as transcription factors to regulate gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-10, and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB).[A229938] They also activate downstream pathways that promote erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocytic development.[A229703]     The molecular pathogenesis of myeloproliferative neoplasms is not fully understood; however, JAK2 is constitutively activated and the JAK-STAT signalling pathway becomes deregulated and aberrant.[A7450, A229938] Ruxolitinib is a selective and potent inhibitor of JAK2 and JAK1, with some affinity against JAK3 and TYK2. Anticancer effects of ruxolitinib are attributed to its inhibition of JAKs and JAK-mediated phosphorylation of STAT3.[L31938] By downregulating the JAK-STAT pathway, ruxolitinib inhibits myeloproliferation and suppresses the plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α.[A229703]     Activated JAKs are also implicated in graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), which is a severe immune complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation GVHD is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, especially for patients who do not respond well to corticosteroid therapy. Activated JAKS stimulate T-effector cell responses, leading to increased proliferation of effector T cells and heightened production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. By blocking JAK1 and JAk2, ruxolitinib inhibits donor T-cell expansion and suppresses pro-inflammatory responses.[A229913]"
1242,"Prior to its withdrawal, aminopterin was initially used in the treatment of childhood leukemia; specifically to induce remissions. Later, aminopterin was used off-label in the United States to treat psoriasis, yielding dramatic lesion clearing. Aminopterin was later supplanted by methotrexate for treating cancer because of its better therapeutic index. Aminopterin (as well as methotrexate) has also been explored for use as an abortifacient. However, their association with severe congenital malformations and teratogenic effects have become known as fetal aminopterin syndrome. Aminopterin is an amino derivative of folic acid, which was once used as an antineoplastic agent in the treatment of pediatric leukemia. In the 1950's its production was discontinued in favor of methotrexate, which is less potent but less toxic. Off label, aminopterin has also been used in the treatment of psoriasis. Clinicians need to be aware of the characteristic teratologic effects of aminopterin and methotrexate.Aminopterin is an amino derivative of folic acid which binds competitively to the dihydrofolate reductase enzyme to block tetrahydrofolate synthesis. Tetrahydrofolate is essential in the production of purines and pyrimadines, thus it's deficiency results in a reduction of DNA, RNA and protein synthesis. "
1243,"In the US, belimumab is indicated to treat active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and active lupus nephritis in patients aged five years and older who are receiving standard therapy.[L42630] In Europe, belimumab is also used to treat SLE and lupus nephritis but only in adults.[L42705]    The efficacy of belimumab has not been evaluated in patients with severe active central nervous system lupus. Use of belimumab is not recommended in this situation.[L42630]Belimumab is a fully human recombinant IgG1λ monoclonal antibody that inhibits soluble human B lymphocyte stimulator protein (BLyS, also referred to as BAFF and TNFSF13B), a B cell survival factor.[L42630] BLyS levels are often elevated in immunodeficient and autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).[A251495, L42705] By binding to BLyS and blocking its interaction with B cell receptors, belimumab inhibits the survival of B cells. It is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a murine cell (NS0) expression system.[L42630]    Belimumab was first approved by the FDA on March 9, 2011,[A251495] making it the newest drug to be approved for the treatment of SLE in more than 50 years.[A251520] It is currently used to treat SLE and lupus nephritis.[L42630]Belimumab works to inhibit the actions of autoreactive, pro-inflammatory B cells that cause chronic inflammation and tissue damage.[L42630] In patients with SLE, belimumab significantly reduced levels of circulating B (CD20+) cells.[A14436]Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis, a common and serious manifestation of SLE,[A251525] are autoimmune disorders characterized by the presence of autoreactive B lymphocytes (B cells), which promotes the production of autoantibodies that cause inflammation and progressive and irreversible tissue damage.[A14436, A251520] One of the key cytokines involved in B cell homeostasis and survival is B lymphocyte stimulator protein (BLyS),[A14436] which is a member of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily of cytokines.[A251520] While the contribution of BLyS to the pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases is not fully understood, BLyS has been identified as a key therapeutic target for the treatment of SLE as BLyS levels are elevated in patients with SLE along with other autoimmune diseases.[A251495, L42705]     Belimumab is an antibody directed against BLyS: it selectively binds BLyS with high affinity, neutralizes it, and blocks its interaction with B cell receptors - transmembrane activator and calcium-modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI), B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA),[A251520] and BLyS receptor 3 (BR3).[A14436, A251520] Belimumab ultimately inhibits the survival of B cells, promotes apoptosis, and reduces the differentiation and maturation of B cells into immunoglobulin-producing plasma cells.[A14436, A251520, L42630]"

The FDA label states an important warning about the risk of hepatoxicity and teratogenicity for patients using teriflunomide.Teriflunomide is an immunomodulatory agent that decreases the amount of activated CNS lymphocytes, which results in anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects.   The exact mechanism by which teriflunomide acts in MS is not known. What is known is that teriflunomide prevents pyrimidine synthesis by inhibiting the mitochondrial enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, and this may be involved in its immunomodulatory effect in MS."
1245,"Vemurafenib is approved since 2011 for the treatment of metastatic melanoma with a mutation on BRAF in the valine located in the exon 15 at codon 600, this mutation is denominated as V600E.[A31270] The V600E mutation, a substitution of glutamic acid for valine, accounts for 54% of the cases of cutaneous melanoma.[A31271]   Vemurafenib approval was extended in 2017, for its use as a treatment of adult patients with Erdheim-Chester Disease whose cancer cells present BRAF V600 mutation.[L1013] Erdheim-Chester disease is an extremely rare histiocyte cell disorder that affects large bones, large vessels, central nervous system, as well as, skin and lungs. It is reported an association of Erdheim-Chester disease and V600E mutation.[A31272]Vemurafenib is a competitive kinase inhibitor with activity against BRAF kinase with mutations like V600E.[A31269] It exerts its function by binding to the ATP-binding domain of the mutant BRAF.[A31270] Vemurafenib was co-developed by Roche and Plexxikon and it obtained its FDA approval on August 17, 2011, under the company Hoffmann La Roche. After approval, Roche in collaboration with Genentech launched a broad development program. [L1012]BRAF activation results in cell growth, proliferation, and metastasis. BRAF is an intermediary molecule in MAPK whose activation depends on ERK activation, elevation of cyclin D1 and cellular proliferation. The mutation V600E produces a constitutively form of BRAF. Vemurafenib has been shown to reduce all activation markers related to BRAF; in clinical trials, vemurafenib treatment showed a reduction of cytoplasmic phosphorylated ERK and a cell proliferation driven by Ki-67. Studies also reported decrease in MAPK-related metabolic activity.[A31270] All the different reports indicate thet Vemurafenib generates an almost complete inhibition of the MAPK pathway. Vemurafenib is an orally available inhibitor of mutated BRAF-serine-threonine kinase. Vemurafenif is a small molecule that interacts as a competitive inhibitor of the mutated species of BRAF. It is especially potent against the BRAF V600E mutation. Vemurafenib blocks downstream processes to inhibit tumour growth and eventually trigger apoptosis.

1246,"Linagliptin is indicated for the treatment of type II diabetes in addition to diet and exercise[L9557]. It should not be used to treat type I diabetes or in diabetic ketoacidosis.[L11479]Linagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor developed by Boehringer Ingelheim for the treatment of type II diabetes [L9557]. Linagliptin differs from other DPP-4 inhibitors in that it has a non-linear pharmacokinetic profile, is not primarily eliminated by the renal system, and obeys concentration dependant protein binding[A37050]. Linagliptin was approved by the FDA on May 2, 2011[L9557].A 5mg oral dose of linagliptin results in >80% inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) for ≥24 hours[A37050]. Inhibition of DPP-4 increases the concentration of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), leading to decreased glycosylated hemoglobin and fasting plasma glucose[A37050].Linagliptin is a competitive, reversible DPP-4 inhibitor. Inhibition of this enzyme slows the breakdown of GLP-1 and glucose-dependant insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)[A37050,L9557]. GLP-1 and GIP stimulate the release of insulin from beta cells in the pancreas while inhibiting release of glucagon from pancreatic beta cells[L9557]. These effects together reduce the breakdown of glycogen in the liver and increase insulin release in response to glucose[L9557][A37050]."

1248,"The opthalmic agent is used for the treatment of neovascular (Wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD), macular edema following retinal vein occlusion (RVO), diabetic macular edema (DME), diabetic retinopathy (DR), and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).[L45141]Aflibercept is a recombinant protein composed of the binding domains of two human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, fused with the Fc region of human immunoglobulin gamma 1 (IgG1).[A261130] Structurally, Aflibercept is a dimeric glycoprotein with a protein molecular weight of 96.9 kilo Daltons (kDa).[A261276] It contains approximately 15% glycosylation to give a total molecular weight of 115 kDa.[L47915] All five putative N-glycosylation sites on each polypeptide chain predicted by the primary sequence can be occupied with carbohydrates and exhibit some degree of chain heterogeneity, including heterogeneity in terminal sialic acid residues, except at the single unsialylated site associated with the Fc domain.[A261281,A261286] Due to the 2 fused VEGFR, aflibercept has a higher affinity to the cognate ligands than the endogenous individual receptor. However, it lacks the intracellular structure to propagate subsequent signal transduction, thus essentially sequestering the ligands to prevent activation of VEGFR.[A261130,L47915]    Ziv-aflibercept, under the brand name Zaltrap, was developed as an intravenous injection for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, and it was approved by the FDA and EMA in August 2012 and February 2013, respectively.[L47966,L47971] The intravitreal formulation, under the brand name EYELEA, was approved by the FDA for the treatment of retinopathy of prematurity in preterm infants in February 2023 and for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema, and diabetic retinopathy in August 2023.[L47976] An aflibercept biosimilar, Yesafili, was approved for use in the EU in September 2023.[L50036]The equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) for aflibercept for various human receptors are as follow: 0.5 pM for VEGF-A165, 0.36 pM for VEGF-A121, 1.92 pM for VEGF-B, and 39 pM for PlGF-2.[L45141]    The effect of 6 mg per kg intravenous aflibercept every three weeks on QTc interval was evaluated in 87 patients with solid tumors in a randomized, placebo-controlled study. No large changes in the mean QT interval from baseline (i.e., greater than 20 ms as corrected for placebo) based on the Fridericia correction method were detected in the study. However, a small increase in the mean QTc interval (i.e., less than 10 ms) cannot be excluded due to the limitations of the study design.[L45141]Ablibercept is a recombinant fusion protein that acts as a decoy receptor for the ligands, vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and placental growth factor (PIGF). It prevents these ligands to binding to endothelial receptors, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, to suppress neovascularization and decrease vascular permeability. This ultimately will slow vision loss or the progression of metastatic colorectal cancer.[L45141,L47915]"
1249,"Asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi is indicated as a component of a multi-agent chemotherapeutic regimen for the treatment of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and lymphoblastic lymphoma in adults and children who have developed hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived asparaginase.[L149,L34719]Asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi is an asparaginase-specific enzyme derived from Erwinia chrysanthemi used as an anticancer agent. It works by depleting the stores of an important amino acid called asparagine, which is involved in DNA synthesis and cell survival of malignant cells, leading to cell death.[L1448] L-asparaginase was first identified in 1963,[A236344] and there are different formulations of L-asparaginase, including [Asparaginase Escherichia coli] and a pegylated form of this enzyme, [Pegaspargase].[A7464] Asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi and [Asparaginase Escherichia coli] differ in their pharmacokinetic and immunogenic profiles;[L1452] thus, those who are allergic to [Asparaginase Escherichia coli] do not cross-react to Asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi.[A236344] Studies show that substitution of Erwinia asparaginase for E. coli-derived asparaginase following an allergic reaction has been safe and effective.[A236359] Asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi was first approved by the FDA in November 2011 to treat patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who are allergic to E. coli-derived asparaginase: it has been used as part of multi-agent chemotherapy.[L149] In June 2021, the recombinant form of asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi was approved by the FDA as a component of a chemotherapy regimen to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoblastic lymphoma in adult and pediatric patients who are allergic to the E. coli-derived asparaginase.[L34714]Asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi is an enzyme that exerts cytotoxic effects on leukemic cells by depleting the source of an amino acid asparagine, which plays a role in the proliferation, protein metabolism, and survival of malignant cells.[L149]Asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi is a tetrameric enzyme made up of four identical subunits, each having a molecular weight of about 35 kDa. It rapidly and completely catalyzes the deamidation reaction of L-asparagine to aspartic acid and ammonia, resulting in reduced levels of circulating asparagine in the plasma. Asparagine is essential for DNA synthesis, RNA synthesis, protein metabolism, and survival of leukemic cells [A236359]; however, they lack the asparagine synthetase enzyme and depend on an exogenous source of asparagine. Asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi depletes the source of asparagine for leukemic cells, resulting in the death of leukemic cells.[L149,L34719] In addition to asparagine, asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi also deaminates glutamine to a lesser extent.[A7464]"
1250,"Icosapent ethyl is indicated as an adjunct to maximally tolerated statin therapy to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, and unstable angina requiring hospitalizing in adult patients with elevated triglycerides (≥150 mg/dL) and established cardiovascular disease or who have diabetes mellitus and ≥2 other risk factors for cardiovascular disease.[L41105] It is also indicated as an adjunct to diet to reduce triglyceride levels in adult patients with severe (≥500 mg/dL) hypertriglyceridemia.[L41105]Icosapent ethyl or ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid is a synthetic derivative of the omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). It is used as an adjunct therapy for severe hypertriglyceridemia (TG levels > 500 mg/dL) and to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in certain patients with elevated triglycerides. FDA approved on July 26, 2012.Studies suggest that EPA reduces hepatic very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides (VLDL-TG) synthesis and/or secretion and enhances TG clearance from circulating VLDL particles. Potential mechanisms of action include increased β-oxidation; inhibition of acyl-CoA:1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT); decreased lipogenesis in the liver; and increased plasma lipoprotein lipase activity."
1251,"Carfilzomib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received one to three lines of therapy in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone; or dexamethasone; It is also indicated as a single agent for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received one or more lines of therapy.[L39392,L42350]Carfilzomib is an injectable antineoplastic agent (IV only). Chemically, it is a modified tetrapeptidyl epoxide and an analog of epoxomicin. It is also a selective proteasome inhibitor. FDA approved carfilzomib in July 2012 for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma as monotherapy or combination therapy.[L39392]Intravenous carfilzomib administration resulted in suppression of proteasome chymotrypsin-like activity when measured in blood 1 hour after the first dose. On Day 1 of Cycle 1, proteasome inhibition in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) ranged from 79% to 89% at 15 mg/m2, and from 82% to 83% at 20 mg/m2. In addition, carfilzomib administration resulted in inhibition of the LMP2 and MECL1 subunits of the immunoproteasome ranging from 26% to 32% and 41% to 49%, respectively, at 20 mg/m2.  Proteasome inhibition was maintained for ≥ 48 hours following the first dose of carfilzomib for each week of dosing. Resistance against carfilzomib has been observed and although the mechanism has not been confirmed, it is thought that up-regulation of P-glycoprotein may be a contributing factor. Furthermore, studies suggest that carfilzomib is more potent than bortezomib. Carfilzomib is made up of four modified peptides and acts as a proteasome inhibitor. Carfilzomib irreversibly and selectively binds to N-terminal threonine-containing active sites of the 20S proteasome, the proteolytic core particle within the 26S proteasome.  This 20S core has 3 catalytic active sites: the chymotrypsin, trypsin, and caspase-like sites. Inhibition of the chymotrypsin-like site by carfilzomib (β5 and β5i subunits) is the most effective target in decreasing cellular proliferation, ultimately resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of cancerous cells. At higher doses, carfilzomib will inhibit the trypsin-and capase-like sites. "
1252,"Linaclotide is indicated for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation in adults. This indication is approved in the US, Canada, and Europe.[L47211, L47216, L47221]    In the US and Canada, it is also indicated for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation in adults.[L47211, L47221]    In the US, it is also indicated for the treatment of functional constipation in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age.[L47211]Linaclotide is a synthetic 14-amino acid cyclic peptide [A260271] and first-in-class guanylate cyclase-C (G-CC) agonist.[A260271, L47211] Linaclotide is structurally related to human guanylin and uroguanylin, paracrine peptide hormones that are endogenous activators of GC-C.[A260276] It is also a homolog of a heat-stable enterotoxin derived from _Escherichia coli_, the first natural ligand that activates GC-C.[A260286]    Linaclotide is used for the treatment of various types of constipation, including irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. Linaclotide was first approved by the FDA on August 30, 2012.[A260271] It gained EMA and Health Canada approval on November 26, 2012 [L47216] and December 3, 2013,[L47221] respectively. Linaclotide works to improve the symptoms of constipation and gastrointestinal symptoms of conditions involving constipation.[A260286]Linaclotide is a laxative with visceral analgesic and secretory activities.[L47221] In animal studies and clinical trials, linaclotide improved constipation and gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome with predominant constipation and chronic idiopathic constipation.[A260271] In animal models, linaclotide has been shown to both accelerate gastrointestinal transit and reduce intestinal pain. In an animal model of visceral pain, linaclotide reduced abdominal muscle contraction and decreased the activity of pain-sensing nerves.[L47211] Taking linaclotide with a high-fat meal results in looser stools and a higher stool frequency than taking it in the fasted state.[L47211]    Linaclotide binds to its target, guanylate cyclase-C (GC-C), with high affinity and selectivity. Linaclotide and its active metabolite act locally on the luminal surface of the intestinal epithelium.[A260271, L47211] As linaclotide is stable under a highly acidic pH environment, it acts in a pH-independent manner.[A7468, A260271, A260276] Linaclotide is a potent, highly selective agonist of guanylate cyclase-C (GC-C),[L47211] a soluble and single-membrane-spanning enzyme on the luminal surface of intestinal epithelial cells. GC-C regulates chloride secretion.[A260286] Linaclotide has a dual mode of action. Firstly, linaclotide and its active metabolite bind to transmembrane GC-C. Activation of GC-C results in an increase in both intracellular and extracellular concentrations of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Elevated intracellular cGMP activates the cGMP-dependent protein kinase II (PKG-II), which phosphorylates and activates the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) ion channel expressed on the apical surface of intestinal epithelial cells.[A260276] CFTR activation promotes the secretion of chloride and bicarbonate ions and inhibits sodium absorption, resulting in increased intestinal fluid and accelerated GI transit.[A260271, A260276, L47211]    Secondly, linaclotide exerts anti-nociceptive effects by reducing visceral hypersensitivity. Increased levels of extracellular cGMP in submucosa inhibit colonic nociceptors, relieving intestinal pain.[A260271, A260276, A260281]"
1253,"[L32853] It is also indicated for the treatment of neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) in pediatric patients 3 years of age and older and weighing 35kg or more.[L32853]Mirabegron is a sympathomimetic beta-3 adrenergic receptor agonist used to relax the smooth muscle of the bladder in the treatment of urinary frequency and incontinence. It is unique amongst overactive bladder treatment options in that, unlike other treatments such as [solifenacin] and [darifenacin], it lacks significant antimuscarinic activity,[A232553] which is responsible both for the therapeutic effects of these medications and their broad range of adverse effects. Mirabegron has a comparatively favorable adverse effect profile as compared to other available treatment options, and its complementary mechanism to the antimuscarinics that came before it allows for its use alongside solifenacin in refractory cases.[L32853]    Mirabegron first received FDA approval in 2012, under the brand name Myrbetriq, for the treatment of adults with overactive bladder.[L32853] An extended-release granule formulation was subsequently granted approval in March 2021 for the treatment of pediatric patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity.[L32853] Mirabegron is also used in other jurisdictions across the globe, including Canada,[L32925] the EU,[L32945] and Japan.[A7469]Mirabegron exerts its pharmacologic effects by forcing bladder smooth muscle to relax, thereby expanding its capacity and relieving urgency. Mirabegron does not appear to adversely affect the mean maximum flow rate or mean detrusor pressure at maximum flow rate in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms and bladder outlet obstruction (BOO), but should be used with in patients with BOO due to reports of significant urinary retention. Furthermore, mirabegron increases both blood pressure and heart rate in a dose-dependent manner and should therefore be used with caution in patients with severely uncontrolled hypertension or others for whom these increases may prove dangerous.[L32853]Mirabegron is a potent and selective agonist of beta-3 adrenergic receptors. The activation of beta-3 receptors relaxes detrusor smooth muscle during the storage phase of the urinary bladder fill-void cycle, which increases the bladder's storage capacity thereby alleviating feelings of urgency and frequency.[L32853]"
1254,"Tofacitinib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA), active psoriatic arthritis, active ankylosing spondylitis, or moderately-to-severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more TNF blockers.[L30395] It is also indicated as an oral solution in patients ≥2 years of age for the treatment of polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more TNF blockers.[L30395]    Tofacitinib is not recommended to be used in combination with other biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or potent immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine or cyclosporine.[L30395]Tofacitinib is an inhibitor of Janus kinases, a group of intracellular enzymes involved in signalling pathways that affect hematopoiesis and immune cell function. It is approved by the FDA for treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis that responds inadequately to methotrexate or in those who are intolerant to methotrexate.   Besides rheumatoid arthritis, tofacitinib has also been studied in clinical trials for the prevention of organ transplant rejection, and is currently under investigation for the treatment of psoriasis. Known adverse effects include nausea and headache as well as more serious immunologic and hematological adverse effects. Tofacitinib is marketed under the brand name Xeljanz by Pfizer.Tofacitinib targets inflammation present in rheumatoid arthritis by inhibiting the janus kinases involved in the inflammatory response pathway.     In placebo controlled trials of rheumatoid arthritis patients receiving 5mg or 10mg of tofacitinib twice daily, higher ACR20 responses were observed within 2 weeks in some patients (with ACR20 being defined as a minimum 20% reduction in joint pain or tenderness and 20% reduction in arthritis pain, patient disability, inflammatory markers, or global assessments of arthritis by patients or by doctors, according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria list), and improvements in physical functioning greater than placebo were also noted.     Common known adverse effects of tofacitinib include headaches, diarrhea, nausea, nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection. More serious immunologic and hematological adverse effects have also been noted resulting in lymphopenia, neutropenia, anemia, and increased risk of cancer and infection.     Before initiations of tofacitinib patients should be tested for latent infections of tuberculosis, and should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of infection (fungal, viral, bacterial, or mycobacterial) during therapy. Therapy is not to be started in the presence of active infection, systemic or localized, and is to be interrupted if a serious infection occurs.     Tofacitinib has been associated with an increased risk of lymphomas, such as Epstein-Barr virus associated lymphomas, and other malignancies (including lung, breast, gastric, and colorectal cancers). It is recommended to monitor lymphocytes, neutrophils, hemoglobin, liver enzymes, and lipids.     Tofacitinib use is associated with a rapid decrease in C-reactive protein (CRP), dose dependent decreases in natural killer cells, and dose dependent increases in B cells. Depression in C-reactive protein levels continue after 2 weeks of tofacitinib discontinuation and suggest that pharmacodynamic activity last longer than pharmacokinetic half life. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease characterized by a dysregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL7, IL15, IL21, IL6, IFN-alpha, and IFN-beta. (3) Cytokines signalling results in tissue inflammation and joint damage by stimulating the recruitment and activation of immune cells via the janus kinase signalling pathway.    Tofacitinib is a partial and reversible janus kinase (JAK) inihibitor that will prevent the body from responding to cytokine signals. By inhibiting JAKs, tofacitinib prevents the phosphorylation and activation of STATs. The JAK-STAT signalling pathway is involved in the transcription of cells involved in hematopoiesis, and immune cell function. Tofacitinib works therapeutically by inhibiting the JAK-STAT pathway to decrease the inflammatory response. However, there is evidence to suggest that it may also achieve efficacy via other pathways as well.       "
1255,"Regorafenib is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) who have been previously treated with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based chemotherapy, an anti-VEGF therapy, and, if KRAS wild type, an anti-EGFR therapy. Regorafenib is also indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) who have been previously treated with imatinib mesylate and sunitinib malate. Regorafenib is also indicated for the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) previously treated with sorafenib.[L16835]Regorafenib is an orally-administered inhibitor of multiple kinases. It is used for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumours, and hepatocellular carcinoma. FDA approved on September 27, 2012. Approved use of Regorafenib was expanded to treat Hepatocellular Carcinoma in April 2017.Regorafenib is a small molecule inhibitor of multiple membrane-bound and intracellular kinases involved in normal cellular functions and in pathologic processes such as oncogenesis, tumor angiogenesis, and maintenance of the tumor microenvironment. In in vitro biochemical or cellular assays, regorafenib or its major human active metabolites M-2 and M-5 inhibited the activity of RET, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, VEGFR3, KIT, PDGFR-alpha, PDGFR-beta, FGFR1, FGFR2, TIE2, DDR2, TrkA, Eph2A, RAF-1, BRAF, BRAFV600E , SAPK2, PTK5, and Abl at concentrations of regorafenib that have been achieved clinically. In in vivo models, regorafenib demonstrated anti-angiogenic activity in a rat tumor model, and inhibition of tumor growth as well as anti-metastatic activity in several mouse xenograft models including some for human colorectal carcinoma."
1256,"Aclidinium bromide inhalation powder is indicated for the long-term, maintenance treatment of bronchospasm associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema.Aclidinium is an anticholinergic for the long-term management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It has a much higher propensity to bind to muscarinic receptors than nicotinic receptors. FDA approved on July 24, 2012.Aclidinium does not prolong the QTc interval or have significant effects on cardiac rhythm. Aclidinium is a long-acting, competitive, and reversible anticholinergic drug that is specific for the acetylcholine muscarinic receptors. It binds to all 5 muscarinic receptor subtypes to a similar affinity. Aclidinium's effects on the airways are mediated through the M3 receptor at the smooth muscle to cause bronchodilation. Prevention of acetylcholine-induced bronchoconstriction effects was dose-dependent and lasted longer than 24 hours."
1257,"Enzalutamide is indicated for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer, metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC), and non-metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (nmCSPC) with biochemical recurrence at high risk for metastasis (high-risk BCR).[L47236]Enzalutamide is an androgen receptor (AR) inhibitor for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), both metastatic and non-metastatic.[L40639] It is a second-generation antiandrogen agent that the FDA approved on August 31, 2012.[L40639, A252667] Although androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the first-line treatment of prostate cancer and remission can be achieved, arising resistance is inevitable, becoming castration-resistant prostate cancer.[A252667] Until recently, docetaxel is the only treatment available for metastatic CRPC; however, AR inhibitors have been developed for more targeted therapy, although first-generation AR inhibitors like bicalutamide did not substantially increase the survival rate.[A252667] Second-generation such as enzalutamide is more efficacious due to a higher affinity to AR and no partial agonist activity compared to bicalutamide.[A252667,A252642]    Due to a favorable pharmacological profile, a phase 1 study of enzalutamide was initiated in July 2007. Compared to the average time of 10 to 15 years for a drug to go from pre-clinical to clinical studies, enzalutamide was developed relatively rapidly.[A252667]Enzalutamide is a second-generation antiandrogen that blocks the activity of androgen and androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer. AR activity and prostate cancer progression are closely related due to the normal physiology of prostate cells, providing the rationale for androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).[A252652] However, resistance will eventually arise after the commencement of ADT in 2-3 years due to the accumulation of mutations, including constitutively active mutation, AR overexpression, and changes in AR splicing variants.[A252657, A252642] Enzalutamide was therefore designed to exploit these mutations.[A26770] In vitro experiments in human prostate cancer cell line VCaP showed that enzalutamide can suppress cell growth and induce apoptosis while other antiandrogens like bicalutamide did not.[A26770]    Clinical trials on prostate cancer patients indicated that enzalutamide can lead to a decrease in serum PSA for at least 12 weeks, although this response can be short-lived and thus resulting in enzalutamide resistance.[A252662,A26770] Patients receiving enzalutamide also had a 37% decreased in the risk of death compared to placebo.[A252647]Enzalutamide is a competitive androgen receptor (AR) inhibitor that has a threefold inhibition on the androgen signaling pathway without significant AR agonist activity.[L43227, A252642] It inhibits androgen binding to its receptor, androgen receptor nuclear translocation, and subsequent interaction with chromosomal DNA to upregulate oncogenes.[A252642, A252647] Enzalutamide binds to the AR with 5 to 8-fold greater affinity than first-generation antiandrogens such as bicalutamide and only 2-3 fold reduced affinity than the natural ligand dihydrotestosterone.[A26770] Molecular docking showed that enzalutamide binds to the ligand binding domain of the AR distinctive from that of bicalutamide.[A252642]  "
1258,"Ponatinib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) that is resistant or intolerant to prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy or Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ALL) that is resistant or intolerant to prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.Ponatinib is a novel Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is especially effective against the T315I mutation for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. FDA approved on December 14, 2012.Ponatinib is a multi-target kinase inhibitor. Its primary cellular target is the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase protein which is constitutively active and promotes the progression of CML. This protein arises from the fused Bcr and Abl gene- what is commonly known as the Philadelphia chromosome. Ponatinib is unique in that it is especially useful in the treatment of resistant CML because it inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of Abl and T315I mutant kinases. The T315I mutation confers resistance in cells as it prevents other Bcr-Abl inhibitors from binding to the Abl kinase. Other targets that ponatinib inhibits are members of the VEGFR, PDGFR, FGFR, EPH receptors and SRC families of kinases, and KIT, RET, TIE2, and FLT3. A decrease in tumour size expressing native or T315I mutant BCR-ABL have been observed in rats. "
1259,"Bedaquiline is indicated as part of combination therapy in the treatment of adult and pediatric patients (5 years and older and weighing at least 15 kg) with pulmonary multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Reserve SIRTURO for use when an effective treatment regimen cannot otherwise be provided.[L48506]    This indication is approved under FDA accelerated approval based on time to sputum culture conversion. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.[L48506]Bedaquiline is a bactericidal antimycobacterial drug belonging to the class of diarylquinoline. The quinolinic central heterocyclic nucleus with alcohol and amine side chains is responsible for bedaquiline-mediated antimycobacterial activity.[A261866] Although it is closely related to fluoroquinolones, bedaquiline does not affect DNA gyrase; instead, bedaquiline inhibits the c subunit of ATP synthase responsible for synthesizing ATP.[A261866] Consequently, bedaquiline can be used to treat mycobacterial infection, particularly tuberculosis (TB).[L48506] Although the current standard of TB treatment of anti-TB drugs for 2 months, including 2 key drugs [isoniazid] and [rifampin], is highly effective, the emergence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) to [isoniazid] and [rifampin] has substantially worsened patients outcome.[A261861]    Bedaquiline was approved by the FDA on December 28, 2012, to treat pulmonary MDR-TB, following favorable results in multiple pre-clinical and clinical studies.[A261856,A261861] It is the first drug that was approved in the last 40 years by the FDA for TB unresponsive to current treatments on the market.[A261856] Currently, bedaquiline is the last-line anti-TB drug and must only be used in an appropriate combination regimen.[L48506,A261866]Bedaquiline is primarily subjected to oxidative metabolism leading to the formation of N-monodesmethyl metabolite (M2). M2 is not thought to contribute significantly to clinical efficacy given its lower average exposure (23% to 31%) in humans and lower antimycobacterial activity (4-fold to 6-fold lower) than the parent compound. However, M2 plasma concentrations appeared to correlate with QT prolongation.[L48506]     Bedaquiline inhibits mycobacterial TB at a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) from 0.002-0.06 μg/ml and with a MIC50 of 0.03 μg/ml. The proportion of naturally resistant bacteria is low, estimated to be in one strain over 107/108 bacteria. Bacteria that have smaller ATP stores (such as dormant, nonreplicating bacilli) are more susceptible to bedaquiline.[A7484]    Additionally, bedaquiline is also effective against nontuberculous mycobacteria, with MICs ranging from 0.06 to 0.5 μg/ml.[A7484]    A potential for the development of resistance to bedaquiline in M. tuberculosis exists. Modification of the atpE target gene, and/or upregulation of the MmpS5-MmpL5 efflux pump (Rv0678 mutations) have been associated with increased bedaquiline MIC values in isolates of M. tuberculosis. Target-based mutations generated in preclinical studies lead to 8- to 133-fold increases in bedaquiline MIC, resulting in MICs ranging from 0.25 to 4 micrograms per mL. Efflux-based mutations have been seen in preclinical and clinical isolates. These lead to 2- to 8-fold increases in bedaquiline MICs, resulting in bedaquiline MICs ranging from 0.25 to 0.5 micrograms per mL.[L48506]     Bedaquiline is a diarylquinoline antimycobacterial drug that inhibits mycobacterial ATP (adenosine 5'-triphosphate) synthase, by binding to subunit c of the enzyme that is essential for the generation of energy in M. tuberculosis.[L48506]  "
1260,"Certolizumab pegol has been approved for several different conditions listed below:    - Symptomatic management of Chron's disease patients and for the maintenance of clinical response in patients with moderate to severe disease with inadequate response to conventional therapy.  - Treatment of adult patients with moderate to severely active rheumatoid arthritis.  - Treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis.  - Treatment of adult patients with active ankylosing spondylitis.  - Treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis that are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.[FDA label]  - Treatment of adult patients with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with objective signs of inflammation.[L5819]    In Canada, certolizumab pegol is additionally approved in combination with [methotrexate] for the symptomatic treatment, including major clinical response, and for the reduction of joint damage in adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis.[L5825]    Inflammation is a biological response against a potential threat. This response can be normal but in certain conditions, the immune system can attack the body's normal cells or tissues which causes an abnormal inflammation.[L5840] TNF-alpha has been identified as a key regulator of the inflammatory response. The signaling cascades of this inflammatory mediator can produce a wide range of reactions including cell death, survival, differentiation, proliferation and migration.[A176660] Certolizumab pegol is a pegylated monoclonal antibody against the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha).[A176585] It is formed with a humanized Fab fragment of 50 kDa, from an IgG 1 isotype, fused to a 40 kDa polyethylene glycol moiety replacing the Fc antibody region. The absence of the Fc region was ideated to prevent complement fixation and antibody-mediated cytotoxicity as well as to markedly increase its half-life.[A176606]     Certolizumab does not require glycosylation for active function and hence, its production is significantly more affordable when compared to other existing TNF-alpha therapies as it can be done directly in bacterial hosts such as _E. coli_.[A176606] It was developed and manufactured by UCB Pharma, first FDA approved in 2008[L45018] and updated for a new indication on March 28, 2019.[L5819]As part of the mechanism of action and nature of the drug, certolizumab does not induce apoptosis in cultured lymphocytes and monocytes. However, as a piece of the inhibition of inflammation, certolizumab pegol inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced production of IL-1 beta and it induces nonapoptotic cell death via signaling transmembrane TNF-alpha.[A176606]     In vitro studies with certolizumab pegol in human tissue did not show any unexpected binding at 3 mcg/ml nor at 10 mcg/ml. Due to the drug class, certolizumab pegol is not expected to present adverse effects on the major vital systems.[F4232]    In phase III clinical trials in psoriatic arthritis patients, certolizumab pegol was reported to generate improvements in skin disease, joint involvement, dactylitis, enthesitis and general life quality. The clinical effect of certolizumab was paired to a comparable safety profile to other TNF-alpha inhibitors.[A176606]    The clinical effectiveness of certolizumab pegol was mainly studied in six randomized controlled trials that compared its effect versus placebo. In a comparative study, the efficacy for certolizumab pegol registered ranged from 30-65% while in placebo ranged from 4-25%.[A176612] However, in other additional trials, certolizumab was proven to present a similar clinical efficacy to other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in patients with inadequate response to TNF inhibitors.[A176603]Certolizumab targets the activation of TNF-alpha with high affinity (KD 90 pM and IC90 0.004 mcg/ml) which inhibits the downstream inflammatory process.[A176585] It acts by binding and neutralizing the soluble and membrane portions of TNF-alpha without inducing complement or antibody-dependent cytotoxicity due to the lack of the Fc region. The inhibition of TNF-alpha is achieved in a dose-dependent manner and it does not present activity against lymphotoxin alpha (TNF-beta).[A176606, F4232]    One additional feature od certolizumab pegol is that, due to the presence of the PEGylation, it is more significantly distributed into inflamed tissues when compared to other TNF-alpha inhibitors such as [infliximab] and [adalimumab].[A176606]"
1261,"Fluticasone furoate is indicated for once-daily maintenance (i.e. prophylactic) treatment of asthma in patients ≥5 years old.[L44456,L46481]     Fluticasone furoate is available over the counter as a nasal spray for the symptomatic treatment of hay fever and other upper respiratory allergies in patients ≥2 years old.[L40843]Fluticasone furoate is a synthetic glucocorticoid available as an inhaler and nasal spray for various inflammatory indications[FDA Label][F4364]. Fluticasone furoate was first approved in 2007[L5965].Fluticasone furoate is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory activity. Though effective for the treatment of asthma, corticosteroids may not affect symptoms immediately. Individual patients will experience a variable time to onset and degree of symptom relief. Maximum benefit may not be achieved for 1 to 2 weeks or longer after starting treatment. When corticosteroids are discontinued, asthma stability may persist for several days or longer.[L40838]     Trials in subjects with asthma have shown a favorable ratio between topical anti-inflammatory activity and systemic corticosteroid effects with recommended doses of orally inhaled fluticasone furoate. This is explained by a combination of a relatively high local anti-inflammatory effect, negligible oral systemic bioavailability (approximately 1.3%), and the minimal pharmacological activity of the metabolites detected in man.[L40838]    Inhaled fluticasone furoate at repeat doses of up to 400 mcg in healthy subjects was not associated with statistically significant decreases in serum or urinary cortisol in healthy subjects. Reductions in serum and urine cortisol levels were observed at fluticasone furoate exposures several-fold higher than exposures observed at the therapeutic dose. For subjects with asthma, a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial in 104 pediatric subjects showed no difference between once-daily treatment with 50 mcg fluticasone compared with placebo on serum cortisol weighted mean (0 to 24 hours) and serum cortisol AUC(0-24) following 6 weeks of treatment.[L40838]    A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial in 185 subjects with asthma aged 12 to 65 years showed no difference between once-daily treatment with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 100 mcg/25 mcg or fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 200 mcg/25 mcg compared with placebo on serum cortisol weighted mean (0 to 24 hours), serum cortisol AUC(0-24), and 24-hour urinary cortisol after 6 weeks of treatment, whereas prednisolone 10 mg given once daily for 7 days resulted in significant cortisol suppression.[L40838]    A QT/QTc trial did not demonstrate an effect of fluticasone furoate administration on the QTc interval. The effect of a single dose of 4,000 mcg of orally inhaled fluticasone furoate on the QTc interval was evaluated over 24 hours in 40 healthy male and female subjects in a placebo and positive-controlled (a single dose of 400 mg oral moxifloxacin) cross-over trial. The QTcF maximal mean change from baseline following fluticasone furoate was similar to that observed with placebo with a treatment difference of 0.788 msec (90% CI: -1.802, 3.378). In contrast, moxifloxacin given as a 400-mg tablet resulted in prolongation of the QTcF maximal mean change from baseline compared with placebo with a treatment difference of 9.929 msec (90% CI: 7.339, 12.520).[L40838]Fluticasone furoate has been shown in vitro to exhibit a binding affinity for the human glucocorticoid receptor that is approximately 29.9 times that of dexamethasone and 1.7 times that of fluticasone propionate. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown.[L40838]    The precise mechanism through which fluticasone furoate affects asthma symptoms is not known. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of actions on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, cytokines) involved in inflammation. Specific effects of fluticasone furoate demonstrated in in vitro and in vivo models included activation of the glucocorticoid response element, inhibition of pro-inflammatory transcription factors such as NFkB, and inhibition of antigen-induced lung eosinophilia in sensitized rats.[A177130,L40838] These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids may contribute to their efficacy.[L40838]"
1262,"This drug is used in conjunction with diet and exercise to increase glycemic control in adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus [FDA label].    Another indication for canagliflozin is the prevention of major cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or death due to a cardiovascular cause) in patients with type 2 diabetes, as well as hospitalization for heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes[L5897,[L8917].    In addition to the above, canagliflozin can be used to lower the risk of end-stage kidney disease and major increases in serum creatinine and cardiovascular death for patients with a combination of type 2 diabetes mellitus, diabetic nephropathy, and albuminuria.[L8917]    It is important to note that this drug is **not** indicated for the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus or diabetic ketoacidosis [FDA label]. Canagliflozin, also known as _Invokana_, is a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor used in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus along with lifestyle changes including diet and exercise [FDA label].    It was initially approved by the FDA in 2013 for the management of diabetes and later approved in 2018 for a second indication of reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus [L5897], [FDA label].     Canagliflozin is the first oral antidiabetic drug approved for the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes [L5897]. Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death in these patients [A177083].This drug increases urinary glucose excretion and decreases the renal threshold for glucose (RTG) in a dose-dependent manner [FDA label]. The renal threshold is defined as the lowest level of blood glucose associated with the appearance of detectable glucose in the urine [A176969, T545].  The end result of canagliflozin administration is increased urinary excretion of glucose and less renal absorption of glucose, decreasing glucose concentration in the blood and improving glycemic control.     **A note on type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease**    The risk of cardiovascular events in diabetes type 2 is increased due to the damaging effects of diabetes on blood vessels and nerves in the cardiovascular system.  In particular, there is a tendency for hyperglycemia to create pro-atherogenic (plaque forming) lesions in blood vessels, leading to various fatal and non-fatal events including stroke and myocardial infarction [A177086, L5933].  Long-term glycemic control has been proven to be effective in the prevention of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke in patients with type 2 diabetes [A177095].  The sodium-glucose co-transporter2 (SGLT2), is found in the proximal tubules of the kidney, and reabsorbs filtered glucose from the renal tubular lumen. Canagliflozin inhibits the SGLT2 co-transporter. This inhibition leads to lower reabsorption of filtered glucose into the body and decreases the renal threshold for glucose (RTG), leading to increased glucose excretion in the urine [FDA label]. "
1263,"Dimethyl fumarate is indicated for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), including clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease, in adults.[L43752,L45668,L49831]Dimethyl fumarate is an agent indicated for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis.[A253942,L43752] The mechanism of action of dimethyl fumarate in multiple sclerosis is not well understood. It is thought to involve dimethyl fumarate degradation to its active metabolite monomethyl fumarate (MMF) then MMF up-regulates the Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) pathway that is activated in response to oxidative stress.[L43752] Dimethyl fumarate is marketed under the brand name Tecfidera, and it was the third oral disease-modifying agent for multiple sclerosis approved by the FDA, following [fingolimod] and [teriflunomide].[A253917] Prior to its FDA approval, dimethyl fumarate had been used in Germany for treatment of psoriasis.[A253917]The physiological effects of dimethyl fumarate on the body are not well understood. It has anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects, likely involved in its actions in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.[A253942] Dimethyl fumarate does not cause clinically significant QT interval prolongation. However, cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, serious opportunistic infections, lymphopenia and liver injury have been reported in MS patients treated with this drug. Dimethyl fumarate may also cause anaphylaxis and angioedema.[L43752]The mechanism of action of dimethyl fumarate in multiple sclerosis is not well understood. It is thought to involve dimethyl fumarate degradation to its active metabolite, monomethyl fumarate (MMF). Both dimethyl fumarate and MMF up-regulate the Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) pathway that is activated in response to oxidative stress. Dimethyl fumarate also suppresses pro-inflammatory genes through nuclear factor kappa B inhibition. Additionally, MMF acts as an agonist at the nicotinic acid receptor, but the relevance of this is unknown.[A253917,L43752]    It has been suggested that dimethyl fumarate exerts its immunomodulatory effects through changes in the composition and phenotype of immune cells. It reduces CNS infiltration and alters the composition of all lymphocyte subpopulations, especially for cytotoxic and effector T cells. This causes a shift from a mainly pro-inflammatory phenotype to an anti-inflammatory one.[A253942]"
1264,"Pomalidomide is indicated for patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and have demonstrated disease progression on or within 60 days of completion of the last therapy. It is also indicated for the treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) in AIDS patients who have failed highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and for the treatment of KS in HIV-negative patients.[L40918]Pomalidomide, an analogue of thalidomide, is an immunomodulatory antineoplastic agent. FDA approved on February 8, 2013.Pomalidomide is more potent than thalidomide (100-times) and lenalidomide (10-times). Promalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent with antineoplastic activity. It is shown to inhibit the proliferation and induce apoptosis of various tumour cells. Furthermore, promalidomide enhances T cell and natural killer (NK) cell-mediated immunity and inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, like TNF-alpha or IL-6, by monocytes. The primary target of promalidomide is thought to be the protein cereblon. It binds to this target and inhibits ubiquitin ligase activity. It is also a transcriptional inhibitor of COX2. "

Trametinib is not indicated for the treatment of patients with colorectal cancer because of known intrinsic resistance to BRAF inhibition.[L45558]Trametinib is an orally bioavailable mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2 inhibitor.[A258298,A258293] It was first approved by the FDA in May 2013 for the treatment of melanoma.[A258298] It was later approved by Health Canada on July 18, 2013 [L45588] and by the European Commission on June 30, 2014.[L45583] Trametinib is currently approved to treat a variety of cancers with BRAF mutations, such as non-small cell lung cancer and thyroid cancer, as monotherapy or in combination with [dabrafenib], a BRAF inhibitor, for improved therapeutic efficacy. Originally developed by Japan Tobacco, trametinib was initially investigated for treating inflammation, but further studies for this indication were not pursued.[A258298]Trametinib inhibits cell growth of various BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumours _in vitro_ and _in vivo_. Trametinib is often used in combination with dabrafenib, a BRAF inhibitor. In BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer, induction of EGFR-mediated MAPK pathway re-activation has been identified as a mechanism of intrinsic resistance to BRAF inhibitors.[L45558]The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) pathway, also known as the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway, activates a cascade of cell surface receptors and intracellular downstream signalling molecules. Activated RAS protein activates RAF, a serine/threonine kinase that activates other downstream proteins [A7496,A258323] such as mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2. MEKs then activates ERK, which works on several target proteins and nuclear transcription factors that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and growth.[A7496,A258323] ARAF, BRAF, and CRAF are three isoforms of RAF identified in humans. In particular, BRAF is known to be the most critical activator in melanoma.[A7496,A258323] Certain cancers, such as melanoma, are associated with BRAF mutations, with one study suggesting that BRAF is mutated in about 50% of melanoma tumours.[A258323] BRAF V600E and V600K mutations account for 95% of BRAF mutations.[A258298] These BRAF mutations cause constitutive activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway,[L45558,L45583] leading to dysregulated proliferation and survival of tumour cells.[A258298]     Trametinib is a reversible, highly selective, allosteric inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2.[L45558,L45583] By binding to unphosphorylated MEK1 and MEK2 with high affinity, trametinib blocks the catalytic activity of MEKs.[A7496,A32984,A258298] It also maintains MEK in an unphosphorylated form, preventing phosphorylation and activation of MEKs.[A7496,A32984,A258298]     _In vitro_ studies suggest that dual inhibition of the MAPK pathway by MEK and B-RAF inhibitors is associated with a synergistic effect and improved therapeutic efficacy in cancers compared to using either drug alone.[A258323] The combined use of trametinib and dabrafenib, a BRAF inhibitor, results in more significant growth inhibition of BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumour cell lines _in vitro_ and prolonged inhibition of tumour growth in BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumour xenografts compared to either drug alone.[L45558] The combined inhibition of MEK by trametinib and RAF by dabrafenib delays the emergence of resistance _in vivo_ in BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma xenografts.[L45583]"
1266,"As monotherapy, dabrafenib is indicated to treat unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test.[L41955]     In combination with [trametinib], dabrafenib is indicated to treat for:    - the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations as detected by an FDA-approved test.[L41955]  - the adjuvant treatment of melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations and involvement of lymph node(s), following complete resection.[L41955]  - the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with BRAF V600E mutation.[L41955]  - the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) with BRAF V600E mutation and with no satisfactory locoregional treatment options.[L41955]  - treatment of adult and pediatric patients six years and older with unresectable or metastatic solid tumours with BRAF V600E mutation who have progressed following prior treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options.

It was approved on May 29, 2013, for the treatment of melanoma with V600E or V6000K mutation.[L41955] It was also used for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with the same mutation.[L41955]Dabrafenib is a kinase inhibitor that is mainly used to target BRAF V600E mutation in multiple types of cancer. Although dabrafenib and [trametinib] both inhibit the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, they inhibit different effectors of the pathway, thus increasing response rate and mitigating resistance without cumulative toxicity.[A248975]    The melanoma approval for use with [trametinib] is based on results from COMBI-AD, a Phase III study of 870 patients with Stage III BRAF V600E/K mutation-positive melanoma treated with dabrafenib + trametinib after complete surgical resection. Patients received doses of dabrafenib (150 mg BID) + trametinib (2 mg QD) combination (n = 438) or matching placebos (n = 432). After a median follow-up of 2.8 years, the primary endpoint of relapse-free survival (RFS) was met.[L2714]    In the case of thyroid cancer, Dabrafenib plus Trametinib is the first regimen demonstrated to have potent clinical activity in BRAF V600E–mutated anaplastic thyroid cancer and is well tolerated. These findings represent a meaningful therapeutic advance for this orphan disease.[L2723]Dabrafenib is a competitive and selective BRAF inhibitor by binding to its ATP pocket.[L41955, A248955] Although dabrafenib can inhibit wild-type BRAF, it has a higher affinity for mutant forms of BRAF, including BRAF V600E, BRAF V600K, and BRAF V600D.[L41955] BRAF is a serine/threonine protein kinase and is involved in activating the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK or MAPK pathway, a pathway that is implicated in cell cycle progression, cell proliferation, and arresting apoptosis.[A248960, A248965, A193614, A70135]Therefore, constitutive active mutation of BRAF such as BRAF V600E is frequently observed in many types of cancer, including melanoma, lung cancer, and colon cancer.[A248970]  "
1267,"Investigated for use in patients with type II diabetes to reduce their risks of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity.Aleglitazar is an investigational drug from the company Hoffmann–La Roche and is currently in a phase III clinical trial called ALECARDIO. It is being investigated for use in patients with type II diabetes to reduce their risks of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Aleglitazar is an agonist at the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) for both the PPARα and PPARγ receptor subtypes. In the phase II clinical trial called SYNCHRONY, with type II diabetic patients, aleglitazar was able to control both lipid and glucose levels in a synergistic manner while also having limited side effects and toxicity.Aleglitazar was rationally designed to be an agonist at the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) for both the PPARα and PPARγ receptor subtypes. Agonistic action at PPARα controls lipid levels, which improves dyslipidemia, and agonistic action at PPARγ controls glucose levels, which improves insulin sensitivity in diabetes."
1268,"Afatinib is a kinase inhibitor indicated as monotherapy [L2937] for the first-line [FDA Label] treatment of (a) Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) TKI (tyrosine kinase inhibitor)-naive adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumours have non-resistant EGFR mutations as detected by an FDA-approved test [FDA Label], and (b) adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC of squamous histology progressing on or after platinum-based chemotherapy [FDA Label, L2937].    Recently, as of January 2018, the US FDA approved a supplemental New Drug Application for Boehringer Ingelheim's Gilotrif (afatinib) for the first line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have non-resistant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations as detected by an FDA-approved test [L2939]. The new label includes data on three additional EGFR mutations: L861Q, G719X and S768I [L2939].Afatinib is a 4-anilinoquinazoline tyrosine kinase inhibitor in the form of a dimaleate salt available as Boehringer Ingelheim's brand name Gilotrif [FDA Label]. For oral use, afatinib tablets are a first-line (initial) treatment for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with common epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations as detected by an FDA-approved test [L2939]. Gilotrif (afatinib) is the first FDA-approved oncology product from Boehringer Ingelheim [L2939].Aberrant ErbB signaling triggered by receptor mutations, and/or amplification, and/or receptor ligand overexpression contributes to the malignant phenotype [L2937]. Mutation in EGFR defines a distinct molecular subtype of lung cancer [L2937].    In non-clinical disease models with ErbB pathway deregulation, afatinib as a single agent effectively blocks ErbB receptor signaling resulting in tumor growth inhibition or tumor regression [L2937]. NSCLC tumors with common activating EGFR mutations (Del 19, L858R) and several less common EGFR mutations in exon 18 (G719X) and exon 21 (L861Q) are particularly sensitive to afatinib treatment in non-clinical and clinical settings [L2937]. Limited non-clinical and/or clinical activity was observed in NSCLC tumors with insertion mutations in exon 20 [L2937].    The acquisition of a secondary T790M mutation is a major mechanism of acquired resistance to afatinib and gene dosage of the T790M-containing allele correlates with the degree of resistance in vitro [L2937]. The T790M mutation is found in approximately 50% of patients' tumors upon disease progression on afatinib, for which T790M targeted EGFR TKIs may be considered as a next line treatment option [L2937]. Other potential mechanisms of resistance to afatinib have been suggested preclinically and MET gene amplification has been observed clinically [L2937].    At the same time, the effect of multiple doses of afatinib (50 mg once daily) on cardiac electrophysiology and the QTc interval was evaluated in an open-label, single-arm study in patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors [FDA Label]. Ultimately, no large changes in the mean QTc interval (i.e., >20 ms) were detected in the study [FDA Label].Afatinib is a potent and selective, irreversible ErbB family blocker [L2937]. Afatinib covalently binds to and irreversibly blocks signaling from all homo and heterodimers formed by the ErbB family members EGFR (ErbB1), HER2 (ErbB2), ErbB3 and ErbB4 [L2937].    In particular, afatinib covalently binds to the kinase domains of EGFR (ErbB1), HER2 (ErbB2), and HER4 (ErbB4) and irreversibly inhibits tyrosine kinase autophosphorylation, resulting in downregulation of ErbB signaling [FDA Label]. Certain mutations in EGFR, including non-resistant mutations in its kinase domain, can result in increased autophosphorylation of the receptor, leading to receptor activation, sometimes in the absence of ligand binding, and can support cell proliferation in NSCLC [FDA Label]. Non-resistant mutations are defined as those occurring in exons constituting the kinase domain of EGFR that lead to increased receptor activation and where efficacy is predicted by 1) clinically meaningful tumor shrinkage with the recommended dose of afatinib and/or 2) inhibition of cellular proliferation or EGFR tyrosine kinase phosphorylation at concentrations of afatinib sustainable at the recommended dosage according to validated methods [FDA Label]. The most commonly found of these mutations are exon 21 L858R substitutions and exon 19 deletions [FDA Label].    Moreover, afatinib demonstrated inhibition of autophosphorylation and/or in vitro proliferation of cell lines expressing wild-type EGFR and in those expressing selected EGFR exon 19 deletion mutations, exon 21 L858R mutations, or other less common non-resistant mutations, at afatinib concentrations achieved in patients [FDA Label]. In addition, afatinib inhibited in vitro proliferation of cell lines overexpressing HER2 [FDA Label]."

Pulmonary hypertension is associated with endothelial dysfunction, impaired synthesis of nitric oxide and insufficient stimulation of the NO-sGC-cGMP pathway.     Riociguat has a dual mode of action. It sensitizes sGC to endogenous NO by stabilizing the NO-sGC binding. Riociguat also directly stimulates sGC via a different binding site, independently of NO. Riociguat stimulates the NO-sGC-cGMP pathway and leads to increased generation of cGMP with subsequent vasodilation. "
1273,"Macitentan is indicated for the treatment of WHO group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) both alone and in combination with tadalafil.[L35890, L39105]Macitentan is a dual endothelin receptor antagonist used in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension.[L35890] It was first approved by the FDA in 2013. Macitentan differs from its predecessor [bosentan] due to its lower risk of hepatotoxicity.Macitentan acts primarily by reducing vasoconstriction and cell proliferation due to endothelin overexpression.[L35890, L39105]Macitentan is an antagonist which binds to the endothelin A and B receptors (EA and EB) and blocks signaling from endothelin-1 and -2.[L35890, L39105, A242402] Pulmonary arterial hypertension has many different mechanisms which contribute to the development of endothelial dysfunction including elevated cytosolic calcium, genetic factors, epigenetic changes, and mitochondrial dysfunction.[A242397] The focus of macitentan's mechanism relates to the role of overexpressed endothelin from the vascular endothelium. Endothelins are released in both a constitutive fashion from secretory vesicles and in response to stimuli via Weibel-Palade storage granules.[A177277] Endothelins bind to the EA and EB receptors, with endothelins -1 and -2 having more affinity than endothelin-3.[A242402] Binding to the Gq coupled EA receptor triggers Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of smooth muscle cells via the phospholipase C (PLC) pathway. Downstream protein kinase C activation may also contribute to increased Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile apparatus. EA receptor activation is also known to contribute to pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell proliferation. The binding of endothelins to the EB receptors acts in opposition to EA signaling by activating the same PLC cascade in endothelial cells to activate endothelial nitric oxide synthase. The subsequent release of nitric oxide produces vasodilation through the cyclic guanosine monophosphate cascade.[A177277] Despite the greater presence of EB receptors on endothelial cells, they are still present on smooth muscle cells and may contribute to cell proliferation through the same mechanisms as EA receptors.[A242402] Macitentan is thought to provide its therapeutic effect primarily via blocking signaling through EA which produces both decreased vasoconstriction via reduced smooth muscle cell contractility and attenuation of the hyperproliferation of smooth muscle cells found in PAH. Blockade of EB is less likely to contribute to a therapeutic effect as this signaling is responsible for the counter-regulatory vasodilatory signal."
1274,"Luliconazole is indicated for the treatment of interdigital tinea pedis, tinea cruris, or tinea corporis infections caused by Trichophyton rubrum and Epidermophyton floccosum.[L39910]Luliconazole is a topical antifungal agent that acts by unknown mechanisms but is postulated to involve altering the synthesis of fungi cell membranes. It was approved by the FDA (USA) in November 2013 and is marketed under the brand name Luzu. Luliconazole is also approved in Japan.Luliconazole kills the organisms Trichophyton rubrum and Epidermophyton floccosum, most likely by altering their fungal cell membranes.The exact mechanism of action for luliconazole's anti-fungal activity is still not known, but luliconazole is thought to inhibit the enzyme lanosterol demethylase. Lanosterol demethylase is needed for the synthesis of ergosterol, which is a major component of the fungus cell membranes. "
1275,"Resistance: Reduced susceptibility to sofosbuvir has been associated with the NS5B substitution mutation S282T [A19634].Sofosbuvir (tradename Sovaldi) is a direct acting antiviral medication used as part of combination therapy to treat chronic Hepatitis C, an infectious liver disease caused by infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as sofosbuvir. As a prodrug nucleotide analog, Sofosbuvir is metabolized into its active form as the antiviral agent 2'-deoxy-2'-α-fluoro-β-C-methyluridine-5'-triphosphate (also known as GS-461203), which acts as a defective substrate for NS5B (non-structural protein 5B) [synthesis]. NS5B, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is essential for the transcription of Hepatitis C viral RNA and for its high replicative rate and genetic diversity [A19594]. Sofosbuvir and other direct acting antivirals are therefore very potent options for the treatment of Hepatitis C, as they exhibit a high barrier to the development of resistance [A19593]. This is an important advantage relative to HCV drugs that target other viral enzymes such as the protease, for which rapid development of resistance has proven to be an important cause of therapeutic failure.      In a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend Sofosbuvir as first line therapy in combination with other antivirals for all six genotypes of Hepatitis C [L852].SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626]. Treatment with direct acting antivirals such as sofosbuvir is associated with very minimal side effects, with the most common being headache and fatigue [FDA Label]. Lack of significant side effects and short duration of therapy is a considerable advantage over older interferon- and ribavirin-based regimens, which were limited by infusion site reactions, reduced blood count, and neuropsychiatric effects [A19635].Its use has also proven successful in the treatment of HCV in patients co-infected with HIV [A19627].    Sofosbuvir is also available as a fixed dose combination product with [DB11613] as the commercially available product Epclusa. First approved in June 2016, Epclusa is the first combination HCV product indicated for the treatment of all genotypes of Hepatitis C with or without cirrhosis. Epclusa is also currently the most potent HCV antiviral medication on the market with a sustained virologic response (SVR) after 12 weeks of therapy of 93-99% depending on genotype and level of cirrhosis [L852]. Both Canadian and American guidelines list Epclusa as a first line recommendation for all genotypes of HCV [L852, A19626].    Notably, sofosbuvir has come under intense scrutiny since its release to market in 2013. With the price per pill set at $1000, a 12-week treatment can cost upwards of $84,000 per patient [A19636].Sofosbuvir acts against HCV and is categorized as a direct-acting antiviral agent (DAA).    At a dose 3 times the recommended dose, sofosbuvir does not prolong QTc to any clinically relevant extent [FDA Label].Sofosbuvir is nucleotide analog inhibitor, which specifically inhibits HCV NS5B (non-structural protein 5B) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Following intracellular metabolism to form the pharmacologically active uridine analog triphosphate (GS-461203), sofosbuvir incorporates into HCV RNA by the NS5B polymerase and acts as a chain terminator [synthesis, A7533]. More specifically, Sofosbuvir prevents HCV viral replication by binding to the two Mg2+ ions present in HCV NS5B polymerase's GDD active site motif and preventing further replication of HCV genetic material [A19638, FDA Label].

1286,"N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (NMDARs) are members of the ionotropic glutamate receptor family, with key roles in brain development and neurological function.[A220118, A220128] NMDARs are heterotetramers that typically involve a dimer of dimers of both GluN1 and GluN2A-D subunits, with each subunit itself composed of an N-terminal domain (NTD), a ligand-binding domain (LBD), a transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Binding at the LBD of the agonists glycine (or D-serine) to the GluN1 subunits and of glutamate to the GluN2 subunits is a regulatory mechanism for channel activation. In addition, allosteric modulators are known to bind at the NTDs and form another layer of regulation.[A220118, A220128] One such allosteric regulator is ifenprodil, which was first shown to bind the NMDARs in the 1990s, and specifically to those NMDARs containing the GluN2B subunit.[A220133] Further studies elucidated that ifenprodil binds strongly at the inter-subunit interface of adjacent GluN1 and GluN2B NTDs, where it acts as a non-competitive antagonist.[A220118, A220128]    Although ifenprodil has received considerable interest in its potential neuromodulatory activities in psychiatric conditions, including dependency[A220138] and depression,[A220143] it has also been shown to have an immunomodulatory effect.[A220143, A196128] In an unbiased screen for compounds capable of reducing cell death induced by infection with the influenza strain H5N1, ifenprodil was found to have a protective effect against H5N1-induced lung damage, in part through its ability to alleviate the H5N1-induced cytokine storm and reduce pulmonary infiltration of neutrophils, natural killer cells, and T cells.[A196128] Ifenprodil is being investigated for its potential utility in treating COVID-19 in an ongoing phase 2b/3 clinical trial (NCT04382924).[L16343]"

More recently focus has shifted to the use of beclamide in behavioural disorders. In mentally handicapped epileptic patients it has been found to decrease anxiety, antisocial and demanding behaviours, and impulsivity. Mood stabilizing effects were also noted. [2]    Additionally, due to its effects on monoamines, beclamide may have a potential place in treating conditions such as tardive dyskinesia and hyperkinetic syndromes. [2]Beclamide (N-benzyl-B-chloropropionamide) is a no longer used drug that possesses anticonvulsant and sedative activity. It was studied in the 1950s for generalised tonic-clonic seizures but was not effective for absence seizures.Beclamide has been used for over three decades with little knowledge of how it acts in the CNS. In one study using rats, beclamide was seen to reduce striatal dopamine and serotonin levels and increase the levels of dopamine's major metabolites (and thus dopamine turnover), while reducing the levels of serotonin's major metabolite below detectable levels. A similar effect on neurotransmitter levels was seen in the rat frontal cortices. It is theorized that animal aggression is linked to levels of biogenic monoamines such as dopamine and serotonin, however the exact role is unclear. [A14453]    "

This leads to a cascade of events that decreases blood pressure, lowering the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events including stroke and myocardial infarction.[A7582,L13994]Aliskiren is a renin inhibitor.[L13994] Renin is secreted by the kidneys when blood volume and renal perfusion decrease. It normally cleaves the protein angiotensinogen to form angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is then converted to angiotensin II, an active protein. Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor that causes the release of catecholamines into the circulation.  It also promotes the secretion of aldosterone in addition to sodium reabsorption, increasing blood pressure. Additionally, angiotensin II acts on the adrenal cortex where it stimulates aldosterone release. Aldosterone increases sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion in the nephron.

In the US, it is approved for patients four year of age and older.In the US, secukinumab is indicated for the treatment of adults with active ankylosing spondylitis, non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with objective signs of inflammation, moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa.[L48771]Secukinumab is a fully human monoclonal IgG1/κ antibody against interleukin-17A (IL-17A), a proinflammatory cytokine implicated in various chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disorders, such as plaque psoriasis.[L39600] By blocking the actions of IL-17A, secukinumab works to inhibit the pro-inflammatory pathways that drive immune-mediated inflammatory disorders.[A249840] Following its first global approval in Japan in December 2014, secukinumab was approved by the European Commission on January 15, 2015, and by the FDA a few days after (January 21, 2015).[A249805] It is currently approved to treat a number of chronic inflammatory conditions, such as plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and hidradenitis suppurativa.[L39600,L42280,L48771]Secukinumab works to ameliorate inflammation in chronic inflammatory disorders by attenuating the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.[L39600] Total serum IL-17A levels, representing free IL-17A and secukinumab-IL-17A complex, were increased to a plateau during drug treatment, then gradually decreased at the end of the treatment as the secukinumab-IL-17A complex was cleared from the body.[A249805] In patients with plaque psoriasis, secukinumab reduced erythema, induration, and desquamation in plaque psoriasis lesions.[L42280] Secukinumab also reduced acanthosis, parakeratosis, keratinocyte proliferation, and decrease in keratinocyte markers - all clinical manifestations of psoriasis.[A7593]    As the formation of CYP450 enzymes can be altered by increased levels of certain cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, TNFα, IFN) during chronic inflammation, secukinumab can potentially alter the concentrations of CYP substrate drugs with a narrow therapeutic index.[L39600]Interleukin-17 (IL-17) is a family of proinflammatory cytokines that mediate normal inflammatory and immune responses.[A7595] The production of IL-17 is mostly promoted by T cells, such as T-helper-17 (Th17) cells,[A7593,A7595,A249805,L42280] but can also be caused by mast cells and neutrophils.[A249835] IL-17 binds to IL-17 receptors, which are expressed on various cell types, including keratinocytes. IL-17 signalling pathway promotes angiogenesis and the release of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and mediators of tissue damage.[A7595,L42280]    IL-17A is a member of IL-17 with the most prominent role in host defence and autoimmunity.[A249835] IL-17A is often upregulated in several autoimmune disorders, such as psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, making it an important therapeutic target.[A249805,L42280] IL-17A is also more potent than IL-17F, another member of IL-17, with a much greater affinity to the IL-17 receptor.[A249835] Secukinumab selectively binds to and inhibits IL-17A,[A249805] preventing its interaction with the IL-17 receptor and activation of the IL-17 receptor signalling pathway associated with inflammatory processes.[A249835,L42280]"
1321,"Vorapaxar is indicated for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) or peripheral arterial disease (PAD).Vorapaxar is a tricyclic himbacine-derived selective inhibitor of protease activated receptor (PAR-1) indicated for reducing the incidence of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) or with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). By inhibiting PAR-1, a thrombin receptor expressed on platelets, vorapaxar prevents thrombin-related platelet aggregation.Vorapaxar inhibits platelet aggregation through the reversible antagonism of protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1), also known as thrombin receptor. PARs are a family of G-protein coupled receptors highly expressed on platelets and activated by serine protease activity of thrombin to mediate thrombotic response. By blocking PAR-1 activating, vorapaxar inhibits thrombin-induced platelet aggregation and thrombin receptor agonist peptide (TRAP)-induced platelet aggregation. Vorapaxar does not inhibit platelet aggregation induced by other agonists such as adenosine diphosphate (ADP), collagen or a thromboxane mimetic."
1322,"Vedolizumab is indicated for adult patients with moderately to severely active Ulcerative Colitis or Crohn’s disease.[L48216]  Vedolizumab is a recombinant humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed against the human lymphocyte α4β7 integrin, a key mediator of gastrointestinal inflammation implicated in diseases like ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease.[L48216] α4β7 integrin facilitates the interaction between lymphocytes and gut endothelial cells through the α4β7 integrin-MAdCAM1 interaction, leading to the mobilization of lymphocytes and thus contributing to gastrointestinal inflammation.[L48216] Integrins implicated in cell migration into the intestinal tract included α2β2, α4β1, and α4β7; however, the selective activity of vedolizumab against α4β7 integrin has been thought to contribute to its more favorable safety profile compared to its predecessor natalizumab, the first integrin receptor antagonist approved by the FDA.[A261576] Vedolizumab is administered by IV infusion over a period of 30 minutes; after the first dose, it is given again at two and six weeks and then every 8 weeks thereafter.[L48216]    Vedolizumab was developed by Takeda and approved by the FDA under the brand name ENTYVIO for the maintenance therapy of moderately to severely active Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn’s Disease in April and September 2023, respectively.[L48226,L48231]Non-clinical studies have shown that the pharmacodynamic effects of vedolizumab are reversible upon removal of the antibody: pharmacologic activity of cells inhibited by vedolizumab could be partially restored within 24 hours after removal, with near complete restoration within 4 days. There are no known drug interactions as vedolizumab is a humanized antibody and does not modulate the production of cytokines, which is known to affect drug metabolism.[L48221]    The α4β7 integrin is expressed on the surface of a discrete subset of memory T-lymphocytes that preferentially migrate into the gastrointestinal tract. Mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) is mainly expressed on gut endothelial cells and plays a critical role in homing T-lymphocytes to gut lymph tissue. The interaction of the α4β7 integrin with MAdCAM-1 has been implicated as an important contributor to chronic inflammation, a hallmark of ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. Inhibition of α4β7 integrin by vedolizumab prevents the adhesion of lymphocytes to its natural ligand, thus decreasing the migration of memory T-lymphocytes across the endothelium into inflamed gastrointestinal parenchymal tissue.[L48216]    In clinical trials with vedolizumab at doses ranging from 0.2 to 10 mg/kg (which includes doses outside of the recommended dose), saturation of α4β7 receptors on subsets of circulating lymphocytes involved in gut-immune surveillance was observed.[L48216]    In clinical trials with vedolizumab at doses ranging from 0.2 to 10 mg/kg and 180 to 750 mg (which include doses outside of the recommended dose) in healthy subjects and in patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease, vedolizumab did not elevate neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, B-helper and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, total memory helper T-lymphocytes, monocytes or natural killer cells.[L48216]    A reduction in gastrointestinal inflammation was observed in rectal biopsy specimens from Phase 2 ulcerative colitis patients exposed to vedolizumab for four or six weeks compared to placebo control as assessed by histopathology.[L48216]    In a study of 14 healthy subjects, vedolizumab did not affect the CD4+ lymphocyte cell counts, CD8+ lymphocyte cell counts, or the CD4+:CD8+ ratios in the CSF.[L48216]Vedolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the α4β7 integrin and blocks the interaction of α4β7 integrin with MAdCAM-1. Vedolizumab does not bind to or inhibit the function of the α4β1 and αEβ7 integrins and does not antagonize the interaction of α4 integrins with vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1).[L48216]    "
1323,"Suvorexant is indicated for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance.Suvorexant is a selective dual antagonist of orexin receptors OX1R and OX2R that promotes sleep by reducing wakefulness and arousal. It has been approved for the treatment of insomnia.Suvorexant is a dual antagonist of orexin receptors OX1R and OX2R. It exerts its pharmacological effect by inhibiting binding of neuropeptides orexin A and B, also known as hypocretin 1 and 2, that are produced by neurons in the lateral hypothalamus. These neurons control the wake-promoting centers of the brain and are active during wakefulness, especially during motor activities, and stop firing during sleep. By inhibiting the reinforcement of arousal systems, suvorexant use causes a decrease in arousal and wakefulness, rather than having a direct sleep-promoting effect."

Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.[L41265,L49996,L50001]Nivolumab is a fully human IgG4 antibody targeting the immune checkpoint programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1).[L12129] This antibody was produced entirely in mice and grafted onto human kappa and IgG4 Fc region with the mutation _S228P_ for additional stability and reduced variability.[A35203] It was developed by Bristol Myers Squibb.[L12129]    Nivolumab was granted FDA approval on 22 December 2014.[L41265,L49996,L50001]Nivolumab blocks PD-1 inhibitory signalling to T-cells.[L12129] It has a long duration of action as it is administered every 2-4 weeks.[L12129] Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of immune-mediated adverse effects, infusion-related adverse effects, complications of allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplants, embryo-fetal toxicity.[L12129]The ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 bind to the PD-1 receptor on T-cells, inhibiting the action of these cells.[L12129] Tumor cells express PD-L1 and PD-L2.[L12129] Nivolumab binds to PD-1, preventing PD-L1 and PD-L2 from inhibiting the action of T-cells, restoring a patient's tumor-specific T-cell response.[A35187]"
1325,"Siltuximab is indicated for the treatment of patients with multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD) who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative and human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) negative. Siltuximab did not bind to virally produced IL-6 in a nonclinical study and was therefore not studied in patients with MCD who are HIV or HHV-8 positive.Siltuximab is a chimeric (human-mouse) monoclonal immunoglobulin G1-kappa antibody produced in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line by recombinant DNA technology. Siltuximab prevents the binding of IL-6 to soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors by forming high affinity complexes with human interleukin-6 (IL-6). Its use is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD) who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative and human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) negative. MCD is a rare blood disorder caused by dysregulated IL-6 production, proliferation of lymphocytes, and subsequent enlargement of the lymph nodes. It is administered as a 1 hour intravenous infusion every 3 weeks.Siltuximab-neutralized antibody-IL-6 complexes interfere with current immunological-based IL-6 quantification methods, therefore measurement of serum or plasma IL-6 concentrations should not be used as a pharmacodynamic marker during treatment. As well, cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver are down regulated by infection and inflammation stimuli, which includes cytokines such as IL-6. By preventing IL-6 signalling through treatment with siltuximab, CYP450 activity may be increased leading to faster metabolism of drugs that are CYP450 substrates. Siltuximab complexes with human IL-6 and prevents binding to soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors, thereby inhibiting the proliferation of lymphocytes. "

It was generated by grafting the variable sequences of a very high-affinity mouse antihuman PD-1 antibody onto a human IgG4-kappa isotype containing a stabilizing S228P Fc mutation.[A18829] It contains 32 cysteine residues and the complete folded molecule includes 4 disulfide linkages as interchain bonds and 23 interchain bonds.[F136] It was developed by Merck & Co and first approved for the treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma by the FDA on September 4, 2014,[L2954] becoming the first approved therapy against PD-1.[A7624] In the time since its initial approval, pembrolizumab has been granted approval in the treatment of a wide variety of cancers.[L38934,L43257]Pembrolizumab exerts its pharmacologic effects by releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response, which in turn improves the anti-tumor immune response.[L38934] Due to its relatively broad mechanism of action, it is useful in the treatment of a wide variety of cancers.    Pembrolizumab can cause immune-mediated adverse reactions - including hepatitis, nephritis, and pneumonitis - in any organ system or tissue. Careful monitoring of the patient (including laboratory evaluation of liver, kidney, and thyroid function) should occur at baseline and periodically throughout therapy to monitor for emerging immune-mediated reactions.[L38934]Pembrolizumab binds with high affinity to the cell surface receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and antagonizes its interaction with its known ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2.[L38934] Under normal circumstances, the binding of the ligands of PD-1 to the receptor inhibits the TCR-mediated T-cell proliferation and cytokine production. This inhibitory signal appears to play a role in self-tolerance and collateral damage minimization after immune responses against a pathogen and maternal tolerance to fetal tissue.     The binding of pembrolizumab to PD-1 prevents this inhibitory pathway, causing a physiological shift towards immune reactivity and enhancing tumor immunosurveillance and anti-tumor immune response.[L38934]"
1327,"Empagliflozin is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in patients aged 10 years and older with type 2 diabetes.[L13688, L45578] It is also indicated in adults to reduce the risk of sustained decline in eGFR, end-stage kidney disease, cardiovascular death, and hospitalization in adults with chronic kidney disease at risk of progression.[L40778, L48255] Empagliflozin is not approved for use in patients with type 1 diabetes.Empagliflozin is an inhibitor of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2), the transporters primarily responsible for the reabsorption of glucose in the kidney.[A203453] It is used clinically as an adjunct to diet and exercise, often in combination with other drug therapies,[L13673,L13679,L11479] for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus.[L13688] The first known inhibitor of SGLTs, phlorizin, was isolated from the bark of apple trees in 1835 and researched extensively into the 20th century, but was ultimately deemed inappropriate for clinical use given its lack of specificity and significant gastrointestinal side effects.[A203501] Attempts at overcoming these limitations first saw the development of O-glucoside analogs of phlorizin (e.g. [remogliflozin etabonate]), but these molecules proved relatively pharmacokinetically unstable. The development of C-glucoside phlorizin analogs remedied the issues observed in the previous generation, and led to the FDA approval of [canagliflozin] in 2013 and both [dapagliflozin] and empagliflozin in 2014.[A203501] As the most recently approved of the ""flozin"" drugs, empagliflozin carries the highest selectivity for SGLT2 over SGLT1 (approximately 2700-fold). Empagliflozin was further approved by the EMA in March 2022 and Health Canada in April 2022, making it the first and only approved treatment in Europe and Canada for adults with symptomatic chronic heart failure regardless of ejection fraction.[L40783,L13916]Empagliflozin lowers blood glucose levels by preventing glucose reabsorption in the kidneys, thereby increasing the amount of glucose excreted in the urine.[L13688] It has a relatively long duration of action requiring only once-daily dosing. Patients should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis regardless of blood glucose level as empagliflozin may precipitate diabetic ketoacidosis in the absence of hyperglycemia.[L13688] As its mechanism of action is contingent on the renal excretion of glucose, empagliflozin may be held in cases of acute kidney injury and/or discontinued in patients who develop chronic renal disease. The overexcretion of glucose creates a sugar-rich urogenital environment which increases the risk of urogenital infections in both male and female patients - monitor closely for signs and symptoms of developing infection.[L13688]The vast majority of glucose filtered through the glomerulus is reabsorbed within the proximal tubule, primarily via SGLT2 (sodium-glucose linked co-transporter-2) which is responsible for ~90% of the total glucose reabsorption within the kidneys. Na+/K+-ATPase on the basolateral membrane of proximal tubular cells utilize ATP to actively pump Na+ ions into the interstitium surrounding the tubule, establishing a Na+ gradient within the tubular cell. SGLT2 on the apical membrane of these cells then utilize this gradient to facilitate secondary active co-transport of both Na+ and glucose out of the filtrate, thereby reabsorbing glucose back into the blood – inhibiting this co-transport, then, allows for a marked increase in glucosuria and decrease in blood glucose levels.[A203453] Empagliflozin is a potent inhibitor of renal SGLT2 transporters located in the proximal tubules of the kidneys and works to lower blood glucose levels via an increase in glucosuria.[L13688] Empagliflozin also appears to exert cardiovascular benefits - specifically in the prevention of heart failure - independent of its blood glucose-lowering effects, though the exact mechanism of this benefit is not precisely understood. Several theories have been posited, including the potential inhibition of Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) 1 in the myocardium and NHE3 in the proximal tubule, reduction of pre-load via diuretic/natriuretic effects and reduction of blood pressure, prevention of cardiac fibrosis via suppression of pro-fibrotic markers, and reduction of pro-inflammatory adipokines.[A203456]"

A specific dosage cannot be recommended for CYP2D6 indeterminate metabolizers.[L41404]  Eliglustat is a glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor used for the long-term treatment of type 1 Gaucher disease.[A3752,L41404] Gaucher disease is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the deficiency of acid β-glucosidase, an enzyme that converts glucosylceramide into glucose and ceramide. In patients with Gaucher disease, the accumulation of glucosylceramide leads to the formation of Gaucher cells that infiltrate the liver, spleen, bone marrow and other organs. This leads to complications such as anemia and thrombocytopenia.[L41404,A246384] By inhibiting glucosylceramide synthase, eliglustat reduces the accumulation of glucosylceramide.[L41404]    Eliglustat is mainly metabolized by CYP2D6.[L41404] Patients selected for eliglustat treatment undergo an FDA-cleared genotyping test to establish if they are CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EMs), intermediate metabolizers (IMs), or poor metabolizers (PMs). The results of this test dictate eliglustat dosing recommendations for each type of patient. There are no dosing recommendations for CYP2D6 ultra-rapid or indeterminate metabolizers.[L41404,A7634] Eliglustat was approved by the FDA in August 2014 as an oral substrate reduction therapy for the first-line treatment of type 1 Gaucher disease.[L41404,A7634] Enzyme replacement continues to be the standard of care for the treatment of type 1 Gaucher disease ([imiglucerase], [velaglucerase alfa], [taliglucerase alfa]); however, oral substrate reduction therapies with favourable safety profiles, such as eliglustat, represent a treatment alternative.[A246389,A7634]Eliglustat is a specific inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase (IC50 =10 ng/mL).[L41404] In vitro studies suggest that eliglustat has minimal or no off-target activity against other glycosidases, such as α-glucosidase I and II, and lysosomal and non-lysosomal glucosylceramidases.[A182192]     At 8 times the recommended dose (800 mg) and a ​​mean peak concentration of 237 ng/mL, eliglustat did not have a clinically significant effect on QTc prolongation. However, modelling of PK/PD data predicts that at a plasma concentration of 500 ng/mL, PR, QRS and QTcF intervals increase 22, 7, and 13 msec, respectively.[L41404] Since high plasma concentrations of eliglustat may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, there are warnings and precautions for patients taking CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors, those with specific CYP2D6 metabolizer status and different degrees of hepatic impairment. Depending on each case, the use of this drug is contraindicated, to be avoided, or requires dosage adjustment.[L41404]     Patients with preexisting cardiac disease (congestive heart failure, recent acute myocardial infarction, bradycardia, heart block, ventricular arrhythmia), long QT syndrome, or those taking Class IA or Class II antiarrhythmic drugs are advised to avoid eliglustat.[L41404]Eliglustat is a glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor used for the treatment of type 1 Gaucher disease.[L41404] Gaucher disease is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the deficiency of acid β-glucosidase, an enzyme that converts glucosylceramide (also known as glucocerebroside) into glucose and ceramide.

Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea has been reported in patients treated with tedizolid.[L11232]Despite renewed efforts to combat the spread of antimicrobial resistance, multidrug-resistant organisms, including gram-positive bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, remain a threat.[A199131, A199086] Oxazolidinones represent a relatively new class of antibacterials inhibiting protein synthesis that is generally capable of overcoming resistance to other bacterial protein synthesis inhibitors.[L11232, A199086, A199089] Protein synthesis involves the action of ribosomes, multi-subunit complexes composed of both protein and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) substituents. Translocation along the length of a messenger RNA and concomitant protein synthesis involves the action of the A, P, and E sites of the peptidyltransferase centre (PTC), which accepts charged aminoacyl-tRNAs and catalyzes the formation of peptide bonds between them. The bacterial 70S ribosome comprises a small (30S) and a large (50S) subunit.[A199134] Early studies into the mechanism of action of oxazolidinone antibiotics suggested that they inhibit a step in the initiation of protein synthesis.[A199083] However, this mechanism was inconsistent with mapped resistance mutations, and later studies involving cross-linking and direct structural determination of the binding site revealed that oxazolidinones, including both [linezolid] and tedizolid, bind in the A site of the PTC by interacting with the 23S rRNA component.[A199080, A199077] The structural studies also revealed that oxazolidinone binding alters the conformation of a conserved nucleotide in the 23S rRNA (U2585 in Escherichia coli), which renders the PTC non-productive for peptide bond formation.[A199077] Hence, tedizolid exerts its effect through inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis.[L11232]"

1332,"Dulaglutide is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults and pediatric patients ≥10 years of age with type 2 diabetes mellitus.[L30380] It is also indicated to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have established cardiovascular disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors.[L30380]Dulaglutide, marketed by Eli Lilly as Trulicity, is a once-weekly subcutaneous glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist designed using recombinant DNA technology; it has been approved as an adjunct therapy to diet and exercise in the management of  2 diabetes (T2DM).[A236070] Dulaglutide was initially approved by the FDA in 2014, and in February 2020 was approved for use in patients with T2DM and multiple cardiovascular risk factors for the prevention of cardiovascular events. It is the first T2DM drug approved to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) risk in primary and secondary prevention populations.[L34665]Dulaglutide reduces fasting glucose concentrations and reduces postprandial glucose (PPG) concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus through the agonism of the GLP-1 receptor.[L30380] This drug primarily acts as an incretin mimetic hormone or analog of human glucagon-like peptide-1, which normally acts on the GLP-1 receptor.[A236075]Dulaglutide activates the GLP-1 receptor found in pancreatic beta cells, increasing intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) in beta cells, leading to insulin release and subsequent reduction of blood glucose concentrations. Additionally, dulaglutide decreases glucagon secretion and slows gastric emptying.[A236075,L30380]"
1333,"Metreleptin is indicated as an adjunct to diet as replacement therapy to treat the complications of leptin deficiency in patients with congenital or acquired generalized lipodystrophy.[L41315,L49901] In Canada, it is additionally approved for use in patients ≥12 years old with confirmed familial partial lipodystrophy or acquired partial lipodystrophy (Barraquer-Simons syndrome) and persistent significant metabolic disease for whom standard treatments have failed to achieve adequate metabolic control.[L49901]Metreleptin, a recombinant analog of the human hormone leptin, is an orphan drug used to treat complications of leptin deficiency in people with lipodystrophy. Lipodystrophies include a range of disorders characterized by the reduction, absence, or altered distribution of adipose tissue.[A263126] Complications of lipodystrophy include metabolic abnormalities such as hypertriglyceridemia, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, and fatty liver disease.[A263126] These metabolic abnormalities are often aggravated by excessive food intake, which is further aggravated by leptin deficiency, a protein secreted by adipose tissue.[L41315] Administration of metreleptin results in improvement of metabolic symptoms including improvements in insulin resistance, reduced HbA1c and fasting glucose, reduced triglycerides, and reductions in food intake. Metreleptin is produced in E. coli and differs from native human leptin by the addition of a methionine residue at its amino terminus.[L41315]    In February 2014, metreleptin was approved by the FDA for the treatment of complications of leptin deficiency, as an adjunct to diet, in patients with congenital generalized or acquired generalized lipodystrophy.[L41315] Metreleptin was approved by Health Canada in January 2024 for the same patient population, in addition to patients with partial lipodystrophy.[L49901]In clinical trials, patients treated with metreleptin showed improvements in insulin sensitivity and reductions in food intake, leading to subsequent reductions in HbA1c, fasting glucose, and fasting triglyceride values.[L41315]Metreleptin is an analog of an endogenous hormone, leptin, which is secreted by adipose tissue and helps to regulate satiety.

1336,"Indicated for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in adult patients with chronic non-cancer pain.Naloxegol, for ""PEGylated naloxol"" is a peripherally-selective opioid antagonist developed by AstraZeneca. It was approved by the FDA in September 2014 and is indicated for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in adult patients with chronic non‑cancer pain. The advantage of naloxegol over the opioid antagonist naloxone is that its PEGylated structure allows for high selectivity for peripheral opioid receptors and lack of entry into the central nervous system through the blood-brain barrier.Use of opioids induces slowing of gastrointestinal motility and transit. Patients do not develop tolerance to these effects, unlike many other opioid side effects. Naloxegol antagonizes mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors, having the highest affinity for mu. Antagonism of gastrointestinal mu-opioid receptors by naloxegol inhibits opioid-induced delay of gastrointestinal transit time.Naloxegol is an antagonist of opioid binding at the mu-opioid receptor. When administered at the recommended dose levels, naloxegol functions as a peripherally-acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist in tissues such as the gastrointestinal tract, thereby decreasing the constipating effects of opioids. Naloxegol has shown more than 6000 fold selectivity for the peripheral mu receptors, and its PEGylated form restricts its action only to the periphery, not affecting the pain-relieving mechanism of opioids in the central nervous system."

Ceftolozane exerts antibacterial effects, preventing the formation of cell walls that protect bacteria from injury and confer resistance to some antibiotics. Its antibacterial activity is also mediated through ceftolozane binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), which are required for peptidoglycan cross-linking for bacterial cell wall synthesis. As a result of cell wall synthesis inhibition, bacterial cells are killed, treating various infections.[A179437,A179431] Ceftolozane has a particularly high affinity to the penicillin-binding proteins for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli as well as Klebsiella pneumoniae and other enteric bacteria.[L6688] In particular, a high affinity has been seen in vitro for penicillin-binding proteins 1b, 1c, 2, and 3 when compared to other antibiotics, ceftazidime and imipenem.

1338,"Blinatumomab is indicated for the treatment of adults and children with relapsed or refractory CD19-positive B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). It is also indicated in adults and children for the treatment of CD19-positive B-cell precursor ALL in first or second complete remission with minimal residual disease (MRD) greater than or equal to 0.1%.[L46991]Blinatumomab is a BiTE-class (bi-specific T-cell engager) constructed monoclonal antibody formed by the recombinant fusion of an anti-CD3 single-chain variable fragment (scFV) and an anti-CD19 scFV through a short peptide linker.[A254836,L44311] CD3 is an antigen expressed on the surface of T-cells, while CD19 is mostly expressed on the surface of malignant B-cells. Since blinatumomab has an affinity to both antigens, it redirects T-cells to tumor cells expressing CD19 and promotes tumor cell lysis and apoptosis.[A7659,A7660,A254831]    Blinatumomab is manufactured by Amgen Inc. and marketed under the brand Blincyto. It was first approved by the FDA in December 2014 for the treatment of CD19-positive B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in relapsed and refractory patients. In March 2018, it was approved under the FDA’s accelerated approval program for the treatment of CD19-positive B-cell precursor ALL in first or second complete remission with minimal residual disease (MRD) greater than or equal to 0.1% in adults and children.[L44311] Full approval for this indication was granted in June 2023.[L46991,L46996]    Blinatumomab has a short half-life, requiring patients to receive a continuous infusion over 4-week cycles using a portable mini-pump for optimum delivery.[A254826]Blinatumomab promoted peripheral T-cell redistribution at the start of infusion or dose escalation. In most patients, T-cell counts were lower in the first 1-2 days of treatment and returned to baseline levels within 7-14 days. An increase in T-cell levels, also known as T-cell expansion, was observed in a few patients. In the first treatment cycle, blinatumomab doses higher than ≥ 5 mcg/m2/day or ≥ 9 mcg/day decreased peripheral B-cell counts to 10 cells/microliter or less. During the blinatumomab-free period between treatment cycles (2 weeks), peripheral B-cell counts did not recover. The use of blinatumomab may lead to an elevation of IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-γ; however, cytokine levels return to baseline within 24 to 48 hours.[L44311] Blinatumomab may lead to the development of cytokine release syndrome, neurological toxicities, infections, tumor lysis syndrome, neutropenia and febrile neutropenia, pancreatitis, leukoencephalopathy and transient elevations in liver enzymes. The use of blinatumomab can also affect a patient’s ability to drive and use machines.[L44311]Blinatumomab is a  bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) that targets CD19, an antigen expressed on the surface of B-cells, and CD3, an antigen expressed on the surface of T-cells.[A7659] B-cell malignancies, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), express high levels of CD19, making it a therapeutic target for the treatment of these conditions. Blinatumomab recruits and activates endogenous T-cells by connecting CD3 in the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex with CD19 on both benign and malignant B cells.[L44311] By bringing T-cells and tumor cells together, blinatumomab induces an immune response that leads to T-cell activation and proliferation. It promotes the release of cytokines such as TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-6, and IL-10 by T-cells, the induction of activation markers, such as CD69 and CD25, and the expression of adhesion molecules on the T-cell surface. Altogether, blinatumomab promotes the lysis of CD19+ tumor cells.[A7659,L44311]"

It has also been reported an inhibition of CLL cell survival and proliferation as well as an impaired in cell migration and a reduction in the secretion of chemokines such as CCL3 and CCL4. The latter effect has been shown to produce regression in xenograft mouse models.[A32306]    Clinical studies for relapsed/refractory CLL in phase I and II showed an approximate 71% of overall response rate.[A32308, A32309]. In the case of relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma, approximately 70% of the tested patients presented a partial or complete response.[A32308, A32310]. In clinical trials for relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, a partial response was found in between 15-20% of the patients studied; while for patients with relapsed/refractory Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, a partial response was observed in over 75% of the patients tested. Finally, for patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma, a partial to complete response was obtained in approximately 54% of the patients.[A32308]Ibrutinib is an inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK). It forms a covalent bond with a cysteine residue in the active site of BTK (Cys481), leading to its inhibition. The inhibition of BTK plays a role in the B-cell receptor signaling and thus, the presence of ibrutinib prevents the phosphorylation of downstream substrates such as PLC-γ.[A32306] "

More specifically, idelalisib targets P110δ, the delta isoform of the enzyme phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, also known as PI-3K. The PI-3Ks are a family of enzymes involved in cellular functions such as cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, motility, survival and intracellular trafficking, which in turn are involved in cancer. In contrast to the other class IA PI3Ks p110α and p110β, p110δ is principally expressed in leukocytes (white blood cells) and is important for the function of T cells, B cell, mast cells and neutrophils. By inhibiting this enzyme, idelalisib induces apoptosis of malignant cells and inhibits several cell signaling pathways, including B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling and C-X-C chemokine receptors type 5 and type 4 signalling, which are involved in trafficking and homing of B-cells to the lymph nodes and bone marrow.

1342,"Ceritinib is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have progressed on or are intolerant to crizotinib. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. An improvement in survival or disease-related symptoms has not been established. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.Ceritinib is used for the treatment of adults with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) following failure (secondary to resistance or intolerance) of prior crizotinib therapy. About 4% of patients with NSCLC have a chromosomal rearrangement that generates a fusion gene between EML4 (echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4) and ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase), which results in constitutive kinase activity that contributes to carcinogenesis and seems to drive the malignant phenotype. Ceritinib exerts its therapeutic effect by inhibiting autophosphorylation of ALK, ALK-mediated phosphorylation of the downstream signaling protein STAT3, and proliferation of ALK-dependent cancer cells. Following treatment with crizotinib (a first-generation ALK inhibitor), most tumours develop drug resistance due to mutations in key ""gatekeeper"" residues of the enzyme. This occurrence led to development of novel second-generation ALK inhibitors such as ceritinib to overcome crizotinib resistance. The FDA approved ceritinib in April 2014 due to a surprisingly high response rate (56%) towards crizotinib-resistant tumours and has designated it with orphan drug status.Ceritinib inhibits Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) also known as ALK tyrosine kinase receptor or CD246 (cluster of differentiation 246), which is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the ALK gene. About 4-5% of NSCLCs have a chromosomal rearrangement that generates a fusion gene between EML4 (echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4) and ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase), which results in constitutive kinase activity that contributes to carcinogenesis and seems to drive the malignant phenotype. Ceritinib exerts its therapeutic effect by inhibiting autophosphorylation of ALK, ALK-mediated phosphorylation of the downstream signaling protein STAT3, and proliferation of ALK-dependent cancer cells. Ceritinib has been shown to inhibit in vitro proliferation of cell lines expressing EML4-ALK and NPM-ALK fusion proteins and demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of EML4-ALK-positive NSCLC xenograft growth in mice and rats."

It is not interchangeable with ritonavir to increase systemic exposure of darunavir 600 mg twice daily, fosamprenavir, saquinavir, or tipranavir due to lack of exposure data. The use of cobicistat is not recommended with darunavir 600 mg twice daily, fosamprenavir, saquinavir or tipranavir. Complex or unknown mechanisms of drug interactions preclude extrapolation of ritonavir drug interactions to certain cobicistat interactions. Cobicistat may result in different drug interactions .Cobicistat, marketed under the name Tybost (formerly GS-9350), indicated for treating infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Although it does not have any anti-HIV activity, cobicistat acts as a pharmacokinetic enhancer by inhibiting cytochrome P450 3A isoforms (CYP3A) and therefore increases the systemic exposure of coadministered agents that are metabolized by CYP3A enzymes. More specifically, cobicistat is indicated to increase systemic exposure of atazanavir or darunavir (once daily dosing regimen) in combination with other antiretroviral agents in the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Increasing systemic exposure of anti-retrovirals (ARVs) without increasing dosage allows for better treatment outcomes and a decreased side effect profile.Cobicistat is a mechanism-based inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) isoforms. Inhibition of CYP3A-mediated metabolism by cobicistat increases the systemic exposure of CYP3A substrates atazanavir and darunavir and therefore enables increased anti-viral activity at a lower dosage. Cobicistat does not have any anti-HIV activity on its own. "
1345,"Vortioxetine is indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD).Vortioxetine is an antidepressant medication indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). It is classified as a serotonin modulator and stimulator (SMS) as it has a multimodal mechanism of action towards the serotonin neurotransmitter system whereby it simultaneously modulates one or more serotonin receptors and inhibits the reuptake of serotonin. More specifically, vortioxetine acts via the following biological mechanisms: as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) through inhibition of the serotonin transporter, as a partial agonist of the 5-HT1B receptor, an agonist of 5-HT1A, and an antagonist of the 5-HT3, 5-HT1D, and 5-HT7 receptors. SMSs were developed because there are many different subtypes of serotonin receptors, however, not all of these receptors appear to be involved in the antidepressant effects of SRIs. Some serotonin receptors seem to play a relatively neutral or insignificant role in the regulation of mood, but others, such as 5-HT1A autoreceptors and 5-HT7 receptors, appear to play an oppositional role in the efficacy of SRIs in treating depression.Vortioxetine binds with high affinity to the human serotonin transporter (Ki=1.6 nM), but not to the norepinephrine (Ki=113 nM) or dopamine (Ki>1000 nM) transporters. Vortioxetine potently and selectively inhibits reuptake of serotonin by inhibition of the serotonin transporter (IC50=5.4 nM). Specifically, vortioxetine binds to 5­HT3 (Ki=3.7 nM), 5­HT1A (Ki=15 nM), 5­HT7 (Ki=19 nM), 5­HT1D (Ki=54 nM), and 5­HT1B (Ki=33 nM), receptors and is a 5­HT3, 5­HT1D, and 5­HT7 receptor antagonist, 5­HT1B receptor partial agonist, and 5­HT1A receptor agonist.Vortioxetine is classified as a serotonin modulator and simulator (SMS) as it has a multimodal mechanism of action towards the serotonin neurotransmitter system whereby it simultaneously modulates one or more serotonin receptors and inhibits the reuptake of serotonin. More specifically, vortioxetine acts via the following biological mechanisms: as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) through inhibition of the serotonin transporter, while also acting as a partial agonist of the 5-HT1B receptor, an agonist of 5-HT1A, and antagonist of the 5-HT3, 5-HT1D, and 5-HT7 receptors."
1346,"For the relief of post-menopausal symptoms and for the prevention of osteoporosis [L1724].Tibolone is a synthetic steroid hormone drug, which is mainly non-selective in its binding profile, acting as an agonist primarily at estrogen receptors (ER), with a preference for ER alpha [L1874].    Tibolone (Livial, Org OD 14), produced by Organon (West Orange, NJ), is a synthetic steroid that possesses estrogenic, androgenic and progestogenic properties. It has been used in Europe for almost 2 decades, primarily for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis and the treatment of post-menopausal symptoms [L1720].  Tibolone is approved in 90 countries to manage menopausal symptoms and in 45 countries to prevent the development of osteoporosis [L1876].    In June 2006, Organon Pharmaceuticals announced the receipt of a Not Approvable Letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), advising the company that the New Drug Application (NDA) for tibolone had not been approved [L1722].    Interestingly, the use of tibolone in the treatment cardiovascular disease has been studied with inconclusive results [A32164]. Tibolone has been to have anti-resorptive effects on bone [L1874].Tibolone prevents bone loss and treating post-menopausal symptoms without stimulating the endometrial tissues, which may lead to malignancy. Typical, drugs that treat post-menopausal symptoms such as estrogen, have a proliferative effect on the endometrium, increasing the risk of endometrial carcinoma [L1725]. The effects on the bone, brain and vaginal tissues can be explained by the estrogenic activity of tibolone.  It is important to note that activity is not expressed in the endometrium. Tibolone behaves differently from estrogen plus progesterone combinations on the breast. Therefore, tibolone can be characterized as a selective estrogen activity regulator [A32150].    Tibolone has been demonstrated to be an effective agent in treating symptoms associated with menopause. A 16 week trial in 1189 women examined the effect of tibolone 2.5 mg once daily on climacteric symptoms. Women treated with tibolone showed improvement from baseline in typical menopausal symptoms including hot flashes, sweating, insomnia, and anxiety [L1879].This drug's effects are owed to the activity of its metabolites in various tissues [L1720].    Upon ingestion, tibolone is quickly converted into three major metabolites: _3 alpha- and 3 beta-hydroxy-tibolone_, which have oestrogenic effects, and the _Delta(4)-isomer_, which has progestogenic and androgenic effects. The specific tissue-selective effects of tibolone occur due to the metabolism, regulation of enzymes and receptor activation that varies in different tissues of the body.     The bone-conserving effects occur due to estradiol receptor activation, while the progesterone and androgen receptors are not involved in this process. Breast tissue of monkeys is not found to be stimulated after tibolone administration,  as occurs with estrogen plus progesterone used in combination. This is explained by the fact that tibolone and its metabolites inhibit _sulphatase and 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase_ (HSD) type I and _stimulate sulphotransferase and 17 beta-HSD type II_.  The combined effects of this process prevent the conversion to active estrogens.    In the uterus, the progestogenic activity of the _Delta(4)-metabolite_ and the effect on estrogen-inactivating enzymes prevent estrogenic stimulation. The mammary gland is not stimulated in currently used animal models. Tibolone has been shown to regulate estrogenic activity in several tissue types by influencing the availability of estrogenic compounds for the estradiol receptor in a selective manner [A32164].    Additionally, tibolone modulates cellular homeostasis in the breast by preventing breast tissue proliferation and stimulating cell apoptosis. Tibolone does not stimulate the endometrium because of the action of its highly stable progestogenic metabolite (Delta(4)-isomer) in combination with an effect on the sulfatase (inhibition)-sulfotransferase (stimulation) system. The estrogenic metabolites of tibolone have direct, favorable effects on the cardiovascular system and, in animal models, this drug has shown no adverse consequences.       The tissue-selective effects of tibolone are the result of metabolism, enzyme regulation and receptor activation that vary in different tissues. The bone-preserving effects of tibolone are the result of estradiol receptor activation, while other steroid receptors, mainly the progesterone and androgen receptors, are not involved in this process.     In a study of monkeys, breast tissue was not stimulated, which occurs with estrogen and progesterone, because tibolone and its metabolites inhibit _sulfatase and 17 beta-hydroxysteroid _dehydrogenase (HSD) type I and stimulate _sulfotransferase and 17 beta-HSD type II_. The simultaneous effects of this process halt conversion to active estrogens. Additionally, tibolone affects cellular homeostasis in the breast by preventing proliferation and stimulating apoptosis. Tibolone does not stimulate the endometrium due to the action of the highly stable progestogenic metabolite (Delta(4)-isomer) in combination with an effect on the sulphatase (inhibition)-sulphotransferase (stimulation) pathway [A32150].    The levels of tibolone metabolites and the alteration of hormonal activities vary according to the tissue type. In endometrial tissue the _Δ4-isomer_ functions as a progestagen, however, in the brain and liver, it shows androgenic effects. In breast tissue, the primary actions of tibolone are strong inhibition of sulfatase activity and weak inhibition of 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity, which leads to blocking the conversion estrone sulfate to E2 [L1720]."
1347,"Tasimelteon oral capsules are indicated for the treatment of non-24 hour sleep-wake disorder in adult patients and for the treatment of nighttime sleep disturbances in Smith-Magenis Syndrome in patients ≥16 years old.[L40963] Tasimelteon oral suspension is indicated for the treatment of nighttime sleep disturbances in Smith-Magenis syndrome in patients 3 to 15 years of age.[L40963]Tasimelteon is a selective dual melatonin receptor agonist indicated for the treatment of Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder (N24HSWD). Occurring commonly in blind individuals without light perception, this condition is often characterized by periods of night-time insomnia and day-time sleepiness. In blind individuals, a lack of light stimulation causes an extension of the 24-hour circadian cycle and can lead to progressively delayed sleep onset. By activating melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the brain, tasimelteon has been shown to improve sleep by resynchronizing the circadian rhythm through its ""non-photic"" mechanism. Tasimelteon is currently the only drug available for the treatment of N24HSWD and was granted orphan drug status by the FDA in 2010.Tasimelteon is a selective dual agonist of the melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2.

1348,"Palbociclib is indicated in combination with [letrozole] as initial endocrine-based therapy for the treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)-negative and hormone receptor(HR)-positive tumors in adult patients with advanced/metastatic breast cancer. It is as well approved in combination with [fulvestrant] in patients with disease progression with prior endocrine therapy.[A176783]    In the official labeling, the use of palbociclib should be accompanied with either an aromatase inhibition, no restricted to letrozole, as initial endocrine-based therapy in postmenopausal women or in man.[L48076]    The breast cancer starts as a group of cancer cells that grow into and destroy the nearby breast tissue. This growth can spread into other parts of the body which is called metastasis. According to the location of the cancer cells, it can be categorized in ductal carcinoma and lobular carcinoma. However, other types of breast cancer include inflammatory breast cancer, Paget disease of the breast, triple negative breast cancer non-Hodgkin lymphoma and soft tissue sarcoma.[L5870] In males, breast cancer is usually treated as the cases of postmenopausal women and almost all the cases are ductal carcinoma.[L5873]Palbociclib is a piperazine pyridopyrimidine[A176792] that acts in the cell cycle machinery. It is a second generation cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor[A176798] selected from a group of pyridopyrimidine compounds due to its favorable physical and pharmaceutical properties.[A176810]    Palbociclib was developed by Pfizer Inc after the discovery that identified the cyclin-dependent kinases as key regulators of cell growth.[L5867] It was originally FDA approved on March 2015 for the treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer and its indications were updated in April 2019 to include male patients based on findings from postmarketing reports and electronic health records demonstrating safety and clinical efficacy.[L4894]Due to its mechanism of action, palbociclib inhibits cell growth and suppresses DNA replication in retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene (RB) proficient cancer cells. As expected, these RB cells present a significant increase in the proportion of cells in G1 state and the presence of palbociclib produces effective dephosphorylation of RB, reduce proliferation and induce senescence causing cell-cycle arrest.[A176810]    In vitro studies showed the potential for palbociclib to reduce cellular proliferation of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cell lines through the inhibition of the cell-cycle progression from G1 to S phase. In this study, it was demonstrated that the sensitivity of the cells significantly increased with the expression of _RB1_ and _CCND1_ and low expression of _CDKN2A_. As well, palbociclib, combined with antiestrogens, enhanced _in vivo_ antitumor activity in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer mouse models.[A176792]    In clinical trials, palbociclib, in combination with letrozole, was shown to significantly increase the progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with metastatic breast cancer without prior endocrine treatment. In the results, the PFS increased from 4.5 to 9.5 months with an overall response rate (ORR) of 24.6%.[A176789]Palbociclib is a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor[A176783] that acts by binding to the ATP pocket with an IC50 in the range of 9-15 nmol/L. It is important to consider that it presents low to absent activity against other kinases.[A176798]     The CDK4/6 kinase is involved, with coregulatory partner cyclin D, in the G1-S transition. Hence, inhibition of this step prevents cell cycle progression in cells in whose this pathway is functioning. This step includes the pathways of the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein and the E2F family of transcription factors.[A176798]"
1349,"**Ovarian cancer**    Olaparib is indicated for the maintenance treatment of adults with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or somatic BRCA-mutated advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in complete or partial response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.[L41100, L42695]    Olaparib is indicated for the maintenance treatment of adults with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in complete or partial response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy and whose cancer is associated with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD)-positive status defined by either: a deleterious or suspected deleterious BRCA mutation, and/or genomic instability.[L41100, L42695]    Olaparib is indicated for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer, who are in complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy.[L41100, L42695]    **Breast cancer**    Olaparib is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious g_BRCA_m human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative high risk early breast cancer who have been treated with neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy.[L41100, L42695, L42820]    Olaparib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious g_BRCA_m, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, who have been treated with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or metastatic setting. Patients with hormone receptor (HR) positive breast cancer should have been treated with a prior endocrine therapy or be considered inappropriate for endocrine therapy.[L41100, L42695]    **Pancreatic cancer**    Olaparib is indicated for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious gBRCAm metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma whose disease has not progressed on at least 16 weeks of a first-line platinum-based chemotherapy regimen.[L41100, L42695]    **Prostate cancer**    Olaparib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or somatic homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have progressed following prior treatment with a hormone agent,[L42695] such as [enzalutamide] or [abiraterone].[L41100]    It is also indicated in combination with [abiraterone] and [prednisone] or [prednisolone] for the treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious BRCA-mutated (BRCAm) metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).[L46971]Olaparib is a selective and potent inhibitor of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes, PARP1 and PARP2.[L41100, L40908, L43792] PARP inhibitors represent a novel class of anti-cancer therapy and they work by taking advantage of a defect in DNA repair in cancer cells with BRCA mutations and inducing cell death.[A246015]     Olaparib is used to treat a number of BRCA-associated tumours, including ovarian cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and prostate cancer.[L41100, L40908, L43792] It was first approved by the FDA and EU in December 2014,[A246020] and by Health Canada in April 2016.[L42820]Olaparib is a cytotoxic and anti-tumour agent. Olaparib inhibits the growth of selective tumour cell lines _in vitro_ and decreases tumour growth in mouse xenograft models of human cancer, both as monotherapy or following platinum-based chemotherapy. The drug exerts anti-tumour effects in cell lines and mouse tumour models with deficiencies in BRCA1/2, ATM, or other genes involved in the homologous recombination repair (HRR) of DNA damage and correlated with platinum response.[L41100]    In preclinical models of cancer, olaparib demonstrated anti-tumour activity when used alone, in combination with chemotherapeutic agents, or radiotherapy.[A246020] Olaparib can act as a chemosensitizer to potentiate the cytotoxicity of DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents such as alkylating agents and platinum-based drugs. It can also act as a radiosensitizer by preventing PARP-mediated DNA repair.[A245985, A246015]Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) are multifunctional enzymes comprising 17 members. They are involved in essential cellular functions, such as DNA transcription and DNA repair.[L41100] PARPs recognize and repair cellular DNA damage, such as single-strand breaks (SSBs) and double-strand breaks (DSBs). Different DNA repair pathways exist to repair these DNA damages, including the base excision repair (BER) pathway for SSBs and BRCA-dependent homologous recombination for DSBs.[A245985]    Olaparib is a PARP inhibitor: while it acts on PARP1, PARP2, and PARP3, olaparib is a more selective competitive inhibitor of NAD+ at the catalytic site of PARP1 and PARP2. Inhibition of the BER pathway by olaparib leads to the accumulation of unrepaired SSBs, which leads to the formation of DSBs, which is the most toxic form of DNA damage. While BRCA-dependent homologous recombination can repair DSBs in normal cells, this repair pathway is defective in cells with BRCA1/2 mutations, such as certain tumour cells.[A246015] Inhibition of PARP in cancer cells with BRCA mutations leads to genomic instability and apoptotic cell death. This end result is also referred to as synthetic lethality, a phenomenon where the combination of two defects - inhibition of PARP activity and loss of DSB repair by HR - that are otherwise benign when alone, lead to detrimental results.[A245985]    _In vitro_ studies have shown that olaparib-induced cytotoxicity may involve inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity and increased formation of PARP-DNA complexes, resulting in DNA damage and cancer cell death.[L41100] "
1350,"Edoxaban is indicated for reducing the risk of stroke and systemic embolism (SE) in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). However, it should not be used in patients with creatinine clearance (CrCL) > 95 mL/min because of increased risk of ischemic stroke compared to warfarin at the highest dose studied (60 mg). It is also indicated for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) following 5-10 days of initial therapy with a parenteral anticoagulant.Edoxaban is a member of the Novel Oral Anti-Coagulants (NOACs) class of drugs, and is a rapidly acting, oral, selective factor Xa inhibitor. By inhibiting factor Xa, a key protein in the coagulation cascade, edoxaban prevents the stepwise amplification of protein factors needed to form blood clots. It is indicated to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism (SE) in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) following 5-10 days of initial therapy with a parenteral anticoagulant. Traditionally, warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, was used for stroke prevention in these individuals but effective use of this drug is limited by it's delayed onset, narrow therapeutic window, need for regular monitoring and INR testing, and numerous drug-drug and drug-food interactions. This has prompted enthusiasm for newer agents such as dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban for effective clot prevention. In addition to once daily dosing, the benefits over warfarin also include significant reductions in hemorrhagic stroke and GI bleeding, and improved compliance, which is beneficial as many patients will be on lifelong therapy.Administration of edoxaban results in prolongation of clotting time tests such as aPTT (activated partial thromboplastin time), PT (prothrombin time), and INR (international normalized ratio).Edoxaban is a selective inhibitor of factor Xa, a serine endopeptidase of the clotting cascade required for cleavage of prothrombin into thrombin."
1351,"Umeclidinium is approved by the FDA and Health Canada for the maintenance treatment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).[L44461,L44456,L46961,L46966] Both products were indicated for the maintenance treatment of COPD, but only the umeclidinium/[vilanterol]/[fluticasone furoate] product was approved for the maintenance treatment of asthma in patients aged 18 years and older.[L44461,L44456,L46961,L46966]Umeclidinium is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) used as a maintenance treatment for symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is a progressive obstructive lung disease characterized by shortness of breath, cough, sputum production, and chronically poor airflow with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of less than 80%.[A7715] Maintenance of the airway is controlled by the parasympathetic nervous system, particularly by the abundance of the muscarinic subtype 3 (M3) in the airway smooth muscle.[A7719] Parasympathetic ganglia are associated with the larger airways while postganglionic fibers innervate the smaller diameter bronchioles contributing to airway resistance.[A7719] By blocking the M3 muscarinic receptor, umeclidinium inhibits the binding of acetylcholine and thereby opens up the airways by preventing bronchoconstriction.[A7719] However, even though umeclidinium monotherapy is well-tolerated for up to 14 days, it is more likely to be used in combination therapy, as the international Gold Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines recommended the use of two long-acting bronchodilators with differing mechanisms of action to maximize efficacy and minimize adverse effects.[A7718,A7714] Umeclidinium was approved by the FDA in April 2014 under the brand name Incruse Ellipta as a standalone product.[L47042] Later, it was further approved as a combination product with [vilanterol] and [vilanterol]/[fluticasone furoate] under the brand name ANORO ELLIPTA and TRELEGY ELLIPTA respectively.[L44461,L44456]. ANORO ELLIPTA was approved in December 2013 while TRELEGY ELLIPTA was approved in September 2017.[L46881,L46886]QTc interval prolongation was studied in a double-blind, multiple-dose, placebo- and positive-controlled, crossover trial in 86 healthy subjects. Following repeat doses of umeclidinium 500 mcg once daily (8 times the recommended dosage) for 10 days, umeclidinium does not prolong QTc to any clinically relevant extent.[L44466] In humans, the M3 receptor has been heavily implicated in the pathophysiology of asthma and COPD. Once the M3 receptor is activated, the phospholipase C would phosphorylate downstream targets, forming inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and eventually releasing intracellular Ca2+.[A260091] Increase in intracellular Ca2+ results in muscle contraction, thus worsening COPD and asthma-related bronchoconstriction.[A260091] Additionally, M3 receptor activation also regulates pathways involving CD38, cyclic ADP ribose (cADPR), and ryanodine receptor channels, all of which control the intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis that will lead to muscle contraction.[A260091]Umeclidinium is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist, which is often referred to as an anticholinergic. It has similar affinity to the subtypes of muscarinic receptors M1 to M5. In the airways, it exhibits pharmacological effects through inhibition of M3 receptors at the smooth muscle leading to bronchodilation. The competitive and reversible nature of antagonism was shown with human and animal origin receptors and isolated organ preparations. In preclinical in vitro as well as in vivo studies, prevention of methacholine- and acetylcholine-induced bronchoconstrictive effects was dose-dependent and lasted longer than 24 hours. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. The bronchodilation following inhalation of umeclidinium is predominantly a site-specific effect.[L44466]"

Lenvatinib also inhibits other RTKs that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular functions, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4; the platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), KIT, and RET. These receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) located in the cell membrane play a central role in the activation of signal transduction pathways involved in the normal regulation of cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis and differentiation, and in pathogenic angiogenesis, lymphogenesis, tumour growth and cancer progression. In particular, VEGF has been identified as a crucial regulator of both physiologic and pathologic angiogenesis and increased expression of VEGF is associated with a poor prognosis in many types of cancers.    Lenvatinib is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, radioactive iodine (RAI)-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. Most patients with thyroid cancer have a very good prognosis with treatment (98% 5 year survival rate) involving surgery and hormone therapy. However, for patients with RAI-refractory thyroid cancer, treatment options are limited and the prognosis is poor, leading to a push for the development of more targeted therapies such as lenvatinib.Based on x-ray crystallography and kinetic interaction studies, lenvatinib binds to the adenosine 5'-triphosphate binding site of VEGFR2 and to a neighbouring region via a cyclopropane ring and thereby inhibits tyrosine kinase activity and associated signalling pathways. Lenvatinib is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor that inhibits the kinase activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4).

It is not recommended to be used in patients with pre-existing moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh class B or C).Nintedanib is a small molecule, competitive, triple angiokinase inhibitor that targets multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and non-receptor tyrosine kinases (nRTKs). Many of these RTKs are implicated in lung fibrosis and tumour angiogenesis, so nintedanib is therefore used in the treatment of proliferative diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, non-small cell lung cancer, and systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease.[L8453,L8459] The specific RTKs that nintedanib inhibits are platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFR) α and β, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1-3, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 1-3, and Fns-Like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3).[L8453,L8459,A185123] Nintedanib binds to the ATP-binding pocket of these receptors and inhibits their activity, thereby blocking signalling cascades that result in the proliferation and migration of lung fibroblasts. Nintedanib also inhibits kinase signalling pathways in various cells within tumour tissues, including endothelial cells, pericytes, smooth muscle cells, and cells contributing to angiogenesis, culminating in an inhibition of cell proliferation and apoptosis of affected tumour cells.[A185123]    In addition to RTK inhibition, nintedanib also prevents the actions of the nRTKs Lck, Lyn, and Src.[L8453,L8459,A185123] The contribution of the inhibition of Lck and Lyn towards the therapeutic efficacy of nintedanib is unclear, but inhibition of the Src pathway by nintedanib has been shown to reduce lung fibrosis.[A185123,A185249]"
1355,"Olodaterol is indicated for use in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema. It is not indicated for the treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD or for the treatment of asthma.Olodaterol is a novel, long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA) that exerts its pharmacological effect by binding and activating beta2-adrenergic receptors located primarily in the lungs. Beta2-adrenergic receptors are membrane-bound receptors that are normally activated by endogenous epinephrine whose signalling, via a downstream L-type calcium channel interaction, mediates smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilation. Activation of the receptor stimulates an associated G protein which then activates adenylate cyclase, catalyzing the formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and protein kinase A (PKA). Elevation of these two molecules induces bronchodilation by relaxation of airway smooth muscles. It is by this mechanism that olodaterol is used for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the progressive airflow obstruction that is characteristic of it. Treatment with bronchodilators helps to mitigate associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough, and sputum production. Single doses of olodaterol have been shown to improve forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1) for 24 h in patients with COPD, allowing once daily dosing. A once-a-day treatment with a LABA has several advantages over short-acting bronchodilators and twice-daily LABAs including improved convenience and compliance and improved airflow over a 24-hour period. Despite similarities in symptoms, olodaterol is not indicated for the treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD or for the treatment of asthma.Olodaterol is a potent agonist of the human beta2-adrenergic receptor in vitro, and is highly selective for this receptor, with much lower levels of activity at the b1- and b3-adrenergic receptors that are commonly expressed on cardiac smooth muscle and adipose tissue, respectively. Binding to the receptor causes smooth muscle relaxation in the lungs and bronchodilation. It has also been shown to potently reverse active bronchoconstriction.

Anoro Ellipta is indicated for the maintenance treatment of patients with COPD[L44461], and Trelegy Ellipta is indicated for the maintenance treatment of patients with COPD as well as the maintenance treatment of asthma in patients aged 18 years and older.[L44456]Vilanterol is a selective long-acting β2-adrenergic agonist (LABA) with inherent 24-hour activity for the once-daily treatment of COPD and asthma.[A7737] This is in response to the need for longer-acting β2-adrenergic agonists to overcome poor patient compliance (due to the frequency of dosing regimens or complexities of drug administration).[A259961] Vilanterol was designed based on the salmeterol molecular scaffold, particularly as a  antedrug analog of salmeterol modification by modifying the salmeterol molecule to create homochiral compounds with the (R)-configuration.[A259961] Vilanterol is 1000 and 400 fold more selective for β2 than β1 and β3 adrenoceptors, respectively, with a faster onset of action than salmeterol.[A259966] Additionally, vilanterol demonstrated a significantly longer duration of action than salmeterol, with the bronchodilator effect still apparent at 22h.[A259966] Vilanterol's pharmacological effect is attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenylyl cyclase which catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Increases in cyclic AMP are associated with the relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of the release of hypersensitivity mediators from mast cells in the lungs.[L46481,L44461,L44456] BREO ELLIPTA is the first vilanterol-containing product to be approved by the FDA in May 2013, followed by ANORO ELLIPTA in December 2013 and TRELEGY ELLIPTA in September 2020.[L46876,L46881,L46886] Although all 3 products are approved for the maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), only TRELEGY ELLIPTA and BREO ELLIPTA are approved for maintenance treatments of asthma in patients aged 18 years and older and 5 years and older respectively.[L46481,L44461,L44456]Vilanterol is a selective long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist. Its pharmacological effect is attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenylyl cyclase which catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).

1357,"Ivabradine is indicated by the FDA to reduce the risk of hospitalization for worsening heart failure in adult patients with stable, symptomatic chronic heart failure with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35%, who are in sinus rhythm with resting heart rate ≥70 beats per minute and either are on maximally tolerated doses of beta-blockers or have a contraindication to beta-blocker use. It is also indicated for treatment of stable symptomatic heart failure as a result of dilated cardiomyopathy for pediatric patients 6 months of age or more[FDA Label].Ivabradine is a novel heart rate lowering medicine for the symptomatic management of stable angina pectoralis and symptomatic chronic heart failure.  Ivabradine, brand name Corlanor, was approved by the FDA in April 2015 for the treatment of chronic heart failure in patients with an ejection fraction of ≤35%, in sinus rhythm with resting heart rate ≥70 beats per minute, who are not on beta-blockers due to contraindications or already receiving maximum beta-blocker dose. Recently a new indication was added to treat symptomatic heart failure from dilated cardiomyopathy for patients 6 months or more in age[Label]. Ivabradine acts by selectively inhibiting the ""funny"" channel pacemaker current (If) in the sinoatrial node in a dose-dependent fashion, resulting in a lower heart rate and thus more blood to flow to the myocardium. Although non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and beta blockers also effectively lower heart rate, they exhibit adverse events due to their negative ionotropic effects. Therefore, as ivabradine is designed as a ""pure"" heart rate-lowering drug by selectively acting on the If channels, it may offer a more favorable side effect profile due to its lower likelihood of causing serious adverse effects.The funny channels (If) open during repolarization and close during depolarization, making ivabradine's activity dependent on heart rate or the closing and opening of the channels. Therefore ivabradine exhibits use-dependence and is more pharmacologically active at higher heart rates. Ivabradine exhibits a linear dose-dependent heart-rate lowering activity (bradycardic effect) until a maximum dose of 30-40mg. At higher doses, the concentration of ivabradine tends to plateau, reducing risk of serious sinus bradycardia.  It has been shown that the metabolite of ivabradine lowers heart rate as well, contributing to ivabradine's overall effect. Ivabradine lowers heart rate by selectively inhibiting If channels (""funny channels"") in the heart in a concentration-dependent manner without affecting any other cardiac ionic channels (including calcium or potassium). Ivabradine binds by entering and attaching to a site on the channel pore from the intracellular side and disrupts If ion current flow, which prolongs diastolic depolarization, lowering heart rate. The If currents are located in the sinoatrial node and are the home of all cardiac pacemaker activity. Ivabradine therefore lowers the pacemaker firing rate, consequently lowering heart rate and reducing myocardial oxygen demand. This allows for an improved oxygen supply and therefore mitigation of ischemia, allowing for a higher exercise capacity and reduction in angina episodes. "
1358,Ophthalmic tetracaine is indicated for the for procedures requiring a rapid and short- acting topical ophthalmic anesthetic.  tetracaine patch is indicated for local dermal analgesia for superficial dermatological procedures and superficial venous access.  tetracaine cream is intended to provide topical local analgesia for superficial dermatological procedures.Tetracaine is an ester local anaesthetic currently available in combination with lidocaine as a cream and patch.Tetracaine is an ester-type anesthetic and produces local anesthesia by blocking the sodium ion channels involved in the initiation and conduction of neuronal impulses.
1359,"Used in the manufacuring of medicated animal feeds [FDA Label].Chlortetracycline is a tetracycline antibiotic, and historically the first member of this class to be identified. It was discovered in 1945 by the scientist, Benjamin Minge Duggar, working at Lederle Laboratories under the supervision of Yellapragada Subbarow. He discovered that this antibiotic was the product of an actinomycete strain he cultured and obtained from a soil sample from a field in Missouri. The organism was named Streptomyces aureofaciens due to its gold-hued color.Tetracycline antibiotics are bacteriostatic agents which act to inhibit bacterial growth and reproduction [T28].Chlortetracycline, like other tetracyclines, competes for the A site of the bacterial ribosome [T28]. This binding competes with tRNA carrying amino acids preventing the addition of more amino acids to the peptide chain. This inhibition of protein synthesis ultimately inhibits growth and reproduction of the bacterial cell as necessary proteins cannot be synthesized."
1360,"For the symptomatic treatment of acute bleeding from esophageal varices. Other treatment options for long-term management of the condition may be considered if necessary, once initial control has been established.Somatostatin, also known as growth hormone-inhibiting hormone, is a naturally-occurring peptide hormone of 14 or 28 amino acid residues [T28] that regulates the endocrine system. It is secreted by the D cells of the islets to inhibit the release of insulin and glucagon, and is also generated in the hypothalamus, where it inhibits the release of growth hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormones from the anterior pituitary [T28]. Somatostatin is initially secreted as a 116 amino acid precursor, preprosomatostatin, which undergoes endoproteolytic cleavage to prosomastatin. Prosomastatin is further process into two active forms, somatostatin-14 (SST-14) and somatostatin-28 (SST-28), an extended SST-14 sequence to the N-terminus [A20384]. The actions of somatostatin are mediated via signalling pathways of G protein-coupled somatostatin receptors.     Antineoplastic effects and potential uses of somatostatin on various tumours, including pituitary adenomas, GEP-NETs, paragangliomas, carcinoids, breast cancers, malignant lymphoma and small-cell lung cancers, have been extensively investigated [A20384]. Somatostatin has been used in the clinical setting for the diagnosis of acromegaly and gastrointestinal tract tumours. Its analogues have been developed to achieve more favourable kinetics for efficiency use in the management of acute conditions, such as esophageal varices. [DB00104] is a long-acting analogue of somatostatin that inhibits the release of a number of hormones, and is clinically used to relieve symptoms of uncommon gastroenteropancreatic endocrine tumours, as well as treat acromegaly [T28].Somatostatin is an endogenous peptide hormone that is secreted by the central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, retina, peripheral neurons and pancreatic D cells of the islets of Langerhans. It exhibits several biological roles but predominantly exerts an inhibitory effect on secretion of other hormones and transmitters [A20384]. While distribution of two active isoforms of somatostatin is similar, SST-14 is more predominant in the enteric neurons and peripheral nerves whereas SST-28 is more prominent in the retina and intestinal mucosal cells [A20384].    **Anterior pituitary gland and brain:** It inhibits the release of growth hormones and thyroid-stimulating hormones, such as thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyrotrophin, from the anterior pituitary while inhibiting the release of dopamine from the midbrain, norepinephrine, TRH and corticotrophin-releasing hormone in the brain [A20384].     **Pancreas:** In the pancreas, somatostatin reduces the secretion of glucagon and insulin as well as bicarbonate ions and other enzymes [A20384, T28].    **Thyroid gland:** Somatosatin reduces secretion of T3, T4, and calcitonin [A20384]. Somatostatin regulates the thyroid function by reducing basal TSH release [T28].    **Gastrointestinal tract:** It attenuates the release of most gastrointestinal hormones such as gastrin, secretin, motilin, gastric acid, enteroglucagon, cholecystokinin (CCK), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), intrinsic factor, pepsin, neurotensin, as well as bile secretion and colonic fluid secretion [A20384].    **Adrenal gland:** It inhibits angiotensin II-stimulated aldosterone secretion and acetylcholine-induced medullary catecholamine secretion [A20384].    **Eye/retina:** Somatostatin inhibits the production of vascular endothelial growth factor [A20384].    **Inflammatory cells and sensory nerves:** The expression of somatostatin has been found in inflammatory cells such as lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages and endothelial cells to act as an autocrine or paracrine regulator in local immune responses. Findings suggest that somatostatin may play a role in exerting local and systemic anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive effects [A20384]. On primary afferent neurons, somatostatin reduces the responses to thermal stimulation in C-mechanoheat sensitive fibers in a dose-dependent fashion and reduces the responses of C-mechanoheat fibers to bradykinin-induced excitation and sensitization to heat [A32599]. Somatostatin is reported to elicit an analgesic effect when applied intrathecally; there is evidence supporting that similar effects may occur when systemically used to treat endocrine disorders [T28].     Somatostatin is thought to reduce bleeding from esophageal varices by causing splanchnic vasoconstriction [A27145]. Somatostatin elicits anti-neoplastic actions on various tumours via direct or indirect effects, or a combination of both [A32595]. Somatostatin binds to 5 subtypes of somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), which are all Gi-protein-coupled transmembrane receptors that inhibits adenylyl cyclase upon activation [A20384]. By inhibiting intracellular cyclic AMP and Ca2+ and by a receptor-linked distal effect on exocytosis, SSTRs block cell secretion [A27323]. The common pathway shared by the receptors involve the activation of phosphotyrosine phosphatase (PTP), and modulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) [A27323]. With the exception of SSTR3, activation of SSTRs lead to activation of voltage-gated potassium channels accompanied by increased K+ currents. This result in membrane hyperpolarization and inhibits depolarization-induced Ca2+ influx through voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels [A20384]. Depending on the receptor subtype, signalling cascades involve activation of other downstream targets such as Na+/H+ exchanger, Rho GTPase, and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) [A20384]. SSTRs 1 to 4 bind both somatostatin isoforms with equal nanomolar binding affinity whereas SSTR5 exhibits a 5- to 10-fold higher binding affinity for SST-28 [A20384].     **Effects of SSTR1:** Upon biding of somatostatin and activation, SSTR1 mediates an antisecretory effect on growth hormone, prolactin and calcitonin [A20384].     **Effects of SSTR2:** SSTR2 subtype dominates in endocrine tissues. By binding to SST2 receptors, somatostatin exerts paracrine inhibitory actions on gastrin release from G cells, histamine release from ECL cells, and directly on parietal cell acid output [T28]. SSTR2 receptor signalling cascades also inhibit the secretion of growth hormone and that of adrenocorticotropin, glucagon, insulin, and interferon-γ [A20384].     **Effects of SSTR3:** Activation of these receptors lead to reduction in cell proliferation [A20384]. SSTR3 triggers PTP-dependent cell apoptosis accompanied by activation of p53 and the pro-apoptotic protein Bax [A27323]. A study of the matrigel sponge assay suggests that through SSTR3-mediated inhibition of both NOS and MAPK activities may lead to the antitumor effects of somatostatin in inhibiting tumor angiogenesis [A32606].    **Effects of SSTR4:** The functions of SSTR4 remain largely unknown [A20384].    **Effects of SSTR5:** Like SSTR2, SSTR5 subtype also predominates in endocrine tissues. Upon activation, SSTR5 signalling cascades exert an inhibitory action on growth hormone, adrenocorticotropin, insulin, and glucagon-like peptide-1 as well as the secretion of amylase [A20384].    The presence of somatostatin receptors has been identified in most neuroendocrine tumours, endocrine gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) tumors, paragangliomas, pheochromocytomas, medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTC) and small cell lung carcinomas [A32600]. The antitumor effects of somatostatin were also effective in various malignant lymphomas and breast tumours [A32600]. Gastrointestinal hormones, such as gastrin, secretin, and cholecystokinin (CCK), as well as growth hormones and growth factors are thought to be elevated in gastrointestinal tract and neuroendocrine tumours and are inhibited by somatostatin [A32595]. _In vitro_, somatostatin inhibited epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced DNA synthesis and replication following  which suggest that somatostatin may have direct anti-proliferative effects via SSTR signalling [A32595]. Acromegaly is characterized as the endocrine disorder caused by a functioning tumour of cells that secrete growth hormone from the anterior pituitary [T28]. Somatostatin analogue therapies serve to normalize the elevated levels of GH and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and attenuate tumour growth.      In the vascular system this likely produces vasoconstriction by inhibiting adenylate cyclase leading to a lowering the concentration of cyclic adenosine monophosphate in the endothelial cells which ultimately blocks vasodilation through this pathway. This vasoconstriction is though the be responsible for reducing blood flow to the esophageal tissues and so reduces bleeding from esophageal varices [A27145].     Somatostatin mediates an analgesic activity by reducing vascular and nociceptive components of inflammation [A32599]. Studies indicate that somatostatin may be present in nociceptive DRG neurons with C-fibers and primary afferent neurons to inhibit the release of transmitters at the presynaptic junctions of the sensory-efferent nerve terminals [A20384]. Exogenous somatostatin has shown to inhibit the release of Substance P from central and peripheral nerve ending [A20384]. "
1361,"Indicated for the treatment of chronic HCV genotype 1a/b or 3 infection. The dosing regimen of 60mg daclatasvir 60 mg with 400mg sofosbuvir once a day is recommended for both genontypes.     Resistance: Reduced susceptibility to daclatasvir was associated with the polymorphisms at NS5A amino acid positions M28, Q30, L31, and Y93 in genotypes 1a, 1b, and 3a patients. NS5A Resistance Testing is recommended for HCV genotype 1a-infected patients with cirrhosis prior to the initiaition of the treatment, as the risk of resistance development is higher in genotype 1a patients. Daclatasvir is a direct-acting antiviral agent against Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) used for the treatment of chronic HCV genotype 1 and 3 infection. It is marketed under the name DAKLINZA and is contained in daily oral tablets as the hydrochloride salt form . Hepatitis C is an infectious liver disease caused by infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Daclatasvir was the first drug with demonstrated safety and therapeutic efficacy in treating HCV genotype 3 without the need for co-administration of interferon or [DB00811]. It exerts its antiviral action by preventing RNA replication and virion assembly via binding to NS5A, a nonstructural phosphoprotein encoded by HCV. Binding to the N-terminus of the D1 domain of NS5A prevents its interaction with host cell proteins and membranes required for virion replication complex assembly. Daclatasvir is shown to target both the cis- and trans-acting functions of NS5A and disrupts the function of new HCV replication complexes by modulating the NS5A phosphorylation status [A19640]. The most common critical NS5A amino acid substitutions that led to reduced susceptibility to daclatasvir therapy occured at position Q30 (Q30H/K/R) and M28 in genotype 1a patients and Y93H in genotype 3 patients.     According to 2017 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), 60mg of daclatasvir is recommended with 400mg [DB08934] for genotype 1a/b patients with or without cirrhosis as second-line therapy. The same dosing regimen can be used as first-line therapy in patients with genotype 3 without cirrhosis and second-line therapy in genotype 3 patients with compensated cirrhosis. Combination therapies that include daclatasir can be used for challenging-to-treat patients who have HIV-1 coinfection, advanced cirrhosis, or post-liver transplant recurrence of HCV [L863]. The therapy is intended to cure or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR12), after 12 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626].     Daclatasvir was FDA-approved in July 2015 for use with [DB08934] (Sovaldi) with or without [DB00811] to treat HCV genotype 1 and 3 infections. The SVR12 in HCV genotype 1a-infected treatment-naïve subjects without and with cirrhosis undergoing daclatasvir and [DB08934] therapy were 88% and 99%, respectively [FDA Label]. The same dosing regimen in treatment-naïve patients with HCV genotype 3 infection with or without cirrhosis achieved SVR12 rates of 71% and 98%, respectively [FDA Label].Daclatasvir is a direct-acting antiviral agent that targets the NS5A and causes a decrease in serum HCV RNA levels. It disrupts HCV replication by specifically inhibiting the critical functions of an NS5A protein in the replication complex [A19640]. It is shown to cause downregulation of the hyperphosphorylation of NS5A. It does not appear to prolong the QT interval even when given at 3 times the maximum recommended dose. NS5A is a viral nonstructural phospoprotein that is part of a functional replication complex in charge of viral RNA genome amplification on endoplasmic reticulum membranes. It has the ability to bind to HCV RNA. It is shown to have two distinct functions in HCV RNA replication based on phosphorylated states. Maintaining the HCV replication complex is mediated by the cis-acting function of basally phosphorylated NS5A and the trans-acting function of hyperphosphorylated NS5A modulates HCV assembly and infectious particle formation [A19640]. Daclatasvir is shown to disrupt hyperphosphorylated NS5A proteins thus interfere with the function of new HCV replication complexes. It is also reported that daclatasvir also blocks both intracellular viral RNA synthesis and virion assembly/secretion in vivo [A19639]. "
1362,"An intravenous solution of hydroxyethyl starch is used to prevent shock following severe blood loss caused by trauma, surgery, or other issues.Hydroxyethyl starch (HES/HAES) is a nonionic starch derivative. Hydroxyethyl starches (HES) are synthetic colloids commonly used for fluid resuscitation to replace intravascular volume.  HES is a general term and can be sub-classified according to average molecular weight, molar substitution, concentration, C2/C6 ratio and Maximum Daily Dose.After isovolemic exchange of blood with 500 mL of HES in healthy volunteers, blood volume is maintained for at least 6 hoursHydroxyethyl starch (HES) is one of the most frequently used plasma substitutes. Recent studies have indicated that HES may reduce capillary leakage."
1363,"Eslicarbazepine acetate is indicated for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients 4 years of age and older.[L4565]Eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL) is an anticonvulsant medication approved for use in Europe, the United States and Canada as an adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures that are not adequately controlled with conventional therapy. Eslicarbazepine acetate is a prodrug that is rapidly converted to eslicarbazepine, the primary active metabolite in the body. Eslicarbazepine's mechanism of action is not well understood, but it is known that it does exert anticonvulsant activity by inhibiting repeated neuronal firing and stabilizing the inactivated state of voltage-gated sodium channels, thus preventing their return to the activated state during which seizure activity can occur.    Eslicarbazepine acetate is marketed as Aptiom in North America and Zebinix or Exalief in Europe. It is available in 200, 400, 600, or 800mg tablets that are taken once daily, with or without food. Eslicarbazepine acetate is associated with numerous side effects including dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, aphasia, lack of concentration, psychomotor retardation, speech disturbances, ataxia, depression and hyponatremia. It is recommended that patients taking eslicarbazepine acetate be monitored for suicidality.Eslicarbazepine acetate is associated with a dose- and concentration-dependant increase in heart rate and prolongation of PR interval.Eslicarbazepine acetate is converted to the active metabolite eslicarbazepine which carries out its anticonvulsant activity. The exact mechanism of action is unknown, but it is thought to involve the inhibition of voltage-gated sodium channels. In in vitro electrophysiological studies, eslicarbazepine was shown to inhibit repeated neuronal firing by stabilizing the inactivated state of voltage-gated sodium channels and preventing their return to the activated state. In vitro studies also showed eslicarbazepine inhibiting T-type calcium channels, which likely also has a role in anticonvulsant activity. "
1364,"Aurothioglucose is indicated for the adjunctive treatment of early active adult and juvenile type rheumatoid arthritis that is not adequately controlled by other anti-inflammatory agents and conservative measures like salicylate, glucocorticoids, etc. [L1925, L1937]. In chronic, advanced cases of rheumatoid arthritis, such gold therapy is not demonstrated to be as valuable [L1937].    Antirheumatic measures such as salicylate and other anti-inflammatory drugs (both steroidal and non steroidal) may be continued after initiation of gold therapy [L1937]. After improvement commences, these measures may be discontinued slowly as symptoms permit [L1937].Aurothioglucose, also known as gold thioglucose, was formerly used to treat rheumatoid arthritis.    Contemporary research on the effect of gold salts treatment began in 1935, primarily to reduce inflammation and to slow disease progression in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [A32326]. The use of gold compounds has decreased since the 1980s owing to numerous side effects, limited efficacy, and slow onset of action. Many if not most gold compounds that were indicated for rheumatoid arthritis therapy have since been replaced with the use of various current disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) like methotrexate and others, which are far more effective.After administration, patient serum levels of gold rise sharply but decline over the following week [L1937]. Peak levels with aqueous preparations are higher and decline faster than those with oily preparations [L1937]. Regular weekly administration produces a continuous rise in the basal value for several months, after which the serum level becomes relatively stable [L1937]. After a standard weekly dose, considerable individual variation in the levels of gold can be observed [L1937]. A steady decline in gold levels occurs when the interval between injections is lengthened, and small amounts may be found in the serum for months after discontinuation of therapy [L1937]. The incidence of toxic reactions is seemingly unrelated to the plasma level of gold, but may perhaps be more associated with the total cumulative content of gold in the body [L1937].Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the lining of various skeletal bone joints of the body [A32325, L1956]. These attacks are facilitated by various pro-inflammatory immune cells and agents like cytokines, histamines, mast cells, macrophages, monocytes, lymphocytes, leukocytes, and many others [A32325]. The longterm result of this unwanted immune response is chronic inflammation and painful tissue damage [A32325, L1956]. The cause of the malfunctioning immune system in rheumatoid arthritis is unknown and there is no definitive cure for the condition [A32325, L1956].    Similarly, the mechanism of action of aurothioglucose is also not well elucidated. Nevertheless, some studies have suggested that the combination of both the sulfhydryl ligand and aureus cation present in aurothioglucose elicits an inhibitory effect on adenylyl cyclase activity in human lymphocyte membranes and in membranes of T and B lymphocyte subsets [A32325]. In particular, such inhibition of the activity of adenylyl cyclase and its various isoforms would theoretically also limit the cyclases' ability to induce mast cell degranulation and histamine release, to enhance respiratory burst effects, to stimulate the action of resting macrophages, to induce and activate phagocytes, to induce neutrophil chemotaxis, etc. - all of which are pro-inflammatory actions [A32325]."
1365,"Peginterferon beta-1a is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of MS, including relapsing-remitting disease, clinically isolated syndrome, and active progressive secondary disease.[L31428]Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic and inflammatory autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, disrupting communication between the brain and other parts of the body. Most patients diagnosed with this illness experience their initial disease symptoms between the age of 20 to 40, often the most productive years of life. Symptoms may include but are not limited to fatigue, gait changes, bowel or bladder dysfunction, abnormal muscle twitching, vision disturbance, and depressing or mood swings.[L5801] MS is one of the most common causes of neurological disability in young adults and is found to occur more frequently in women than in men.[A176474,L5792]    Peginterferon beta-1a is an interferon therapy used for the management of relapsing forms of MS. It was originally approved by the FDA in 2014 for subcutaneous use, and was approved for intramuscular use in January 2021.[L31428] Currently, it is the only approved pegylated interferon for the management of MS with an proven ability to reduce relapses and delay the progression of disability resulting from MS.Peginterferon beta-1a likely reduces MS relapses and the progression of disability and brain lesions associated with MS by reducing inflammation.[A191751,A227983] Specifically,  IFN-beta decreases antigen presentation and T-cell proliferation. In addition, it modifies cytokine and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression while restoring suppressor function.[A227983] The mechanism by which peginterferon beta-1a exerts its effects in patients with multiple sclerosis is unknown[L31428], however, it likely exerts its therapeutic actions by reducing inflammation. Through the binding of IFN-beta to its receptor[A228048], a cascade of transcriptional events occur, decreasing the inflammation that normally results in the progression of MS. Immune cells are the most likely target of therapeutic effects exerted by IFN-beta.[A227983] "
1366,"For the treatment of prepubertal cryptorchidism (not due to anatomical obstruction), for the treatment of selected cases of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (hypogonadism secondary to a pituitary deficiency) in males and for the induction of ovulation and pregnancy in the anovulatory, infertile woman in whom the cause of anovulation is secondary and not due to primary ovarian failure, and who has been appropriately pretreated with human menotropins.Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), a polypeptide hormone produced by the human placenta. Endogenously produced HCG interacts with the LHCG receptor of the ovary and promotes the maintenance of the corpus luteum during the beginning of pregnancy. This allows the corpus luteum to continuously secrete the hormone progesterone during the first trimester, which is required for maintenance of the uterus and prevents menstruation. In males, HCG also stimulates the production of gonadal steroid hormones by stimulating the interstitial cells (Leydig cells) of the testis to produce androgens.      HCG is composed of an alpha and a beta sub-unit. The alpha sub-unit is essentially identical to the alpha sub­ units of the human pituitary gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), as well as to the alpha sub-unit of human thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), while the beta sub­ units of these hormones differ in amino acid sequence. As a drug product, chorionic gonadotropin is a highly purified pyrogen-free preparation obtained from the urine of pregnant females.The action of HCG is virtually identical to that of pituitary LH, although HCG appears to have a small degree of FSH activity as well. It stimulates production of gonadal steroid hormones by stimulating the interstitial cells (Leydig cells) of the testis to produce androgens and the corpus luteum of the ovary to produce progesterone."
1367,"Brexpiprazole is indicated as adjunctive therapy to antidepressants for the treatment of major depressive disorder in adults.[L39568] It is also indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in patients 13 years of age and older.[L39568] Brexpiprazole is also indicated for the treatment of agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease; however, it is not indicated as an as-needed (“prn”) treatment for this condition.[L46417]Brexpiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic and a novel D2 dopamine and serotonin 1A partial agonist called serotonin-dopamine activity modulator (SDAM). It has a high affinity for serotonin, dopamine and alpha (α)-adrenergic receptors.[L46417] Although it is structurally similar to [aripiprazole], brexpiprazole has different binding affinities for dopamine and serotonin receptors. Compared to aripiprazole, brexpiprazole has less potential for partial agonist-mediated adverse effects such as extrapyramidal symptoms, which is attributed to lower intrinsic activity at the D2 receptor. It also displays stronger antagonism at the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors.[A182186, A38385, A259661] Brexpiprazole was first approved by the FDA on July 10, 2015.[A182186] Currently approved for the treatment of depression, schizophrenia, and agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease, brexpiprazole has also been investigated in other psychiatric disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder.[A7782]Brexpiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic agent used to ameliorate the symptoms of psychiatric conditions, such as cognitive deficits and affective symptoms.[A182186] Brexpiprazole has affinity (expressed as Ki) for multiple monoaminergic receptors including serotonin 5-HT1A (0.12 nM), 5-HT2A (0.47 nM), 5-HT2B (1.9 nM), 5-HT7 (3.7 nM), dopamine D2 (0.30 nM), D3 (1.1 nM), and noradrenergic α1A (3.8 nM), α1B (0.17 nM), α1D (2.6 nM), and α2C (0.59 nM) receptors. Brexpiprazole acts as a partial agonist at the 5-HT1A, D2, and D3 receptors and as an antagonist at 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT7, α1A, α1B, α1D, and α2C receptors. Brexpiprazole also exhibits affinity for histamine H1 receptor (19 nM) and for muscarinic M1 receptor (67% inhibition at 10 µM).[L46417]Although the exact mechanism of action of brexpiprazole in psychiatric disorders has not been fully elucidated, the efficacy of brexpiprazole may be attributed to combined partial agonist activity at 5-HT1A and dopamine D2 receptors, and antagonist activity at 5-HT2A receptors. Brexpiprazole binds to these receptors with subnanomolar affinities.[A7782, A259626, L46417] These therapeutic targets have been implicated in psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia and depression. Partial D2 receptor agonism allows the drug to stimulate D2 receptors under low dopamine conditions, while attenuating their activation when dopamine levels are high. Partial agonism at 5-HT1A receptors may be tied to improved memory function and cognitive performance. Antagonism at α-adrenergic receptors has also been implicated in schizophrenia and depression.[A182186, A259641]"

Immediately after ioversol is injected, a peak in iodine plasma levels can be detected. However, depending on the organ being imaged, the time to maximum contrast will vary.[L41780] The time to maximum contrast enhancement will range from the time iodine plasma levels reach their highest concentration to one hour after intravenous bolus administration. The delay between a peak in iodine plasma levels and maximum contrast enhancement is partly due to the accumulation of iodine-containing medium within a lesion and outside the blood pool.[L41780]    For angiographies, the maximum contrast enhancement of ioversol occurs almost immediately (15-120 seconds). Following rapid intravenous injection, ioversol can be visualized in the renal parenchyma within 30 to 60 seconds. In patients with normal renal function, opacification of the calyces and pelves takes place within 1-3 minutes, with an optimum contrast within 5-15 minutes.[L41780] Ioversol is a highly soluble non-ionic ionidated contrast agent. Intravascular injection of ioversol opacifies those vessels in the path of the flow of the contrast medium, allowing the radiographic visualization of the internal structures until significant hemodilution occurs.[L41780] In imaging procedures, ioversol diffuses from the vascular to the extravascular space. In brains with an intact blood-brain barrier, this agent does not diffuse to the extravascular space. However, in patients with a disrupted blood-brain barrier, ioversol accumulates in the interstitial space of the disrupted region.[L41780] As the product Optiray, ioversol enhances computed tomographic imaging through augmentation of radiographic efficiency with the degree of density enhancement directly related to the iodine content in an administered dose.[L41785]"

1372,"Sonidegib is approved for use in the US and EU for treatment of adults with locally advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC) that has recurred post surgery or radiation therapy.  It is also approved for adult patients with BCC who are not eligible for surgery or radiation therapy. (2)Sonidegib is a Hedgehog signaling pathway inhibitor (via smoothened antagonism) developed as an anticancer agent by Novartis. It was FDA approved in 2015 for the treatment of basal cell carcinoma.Sonidegib has been shown to inhibit a transmembrane protein called SMO which plays a role in Hh signal transduction.  This has resulted in inhibition of Hh signaling as well as antitumour activity in various animal models.  In a transgenic mouse model of islet cell neoplasms, tumour volume was reduce by 95% in mice treated with sonidegib when compared with untreated mice. (2)The hedgehog pathway is involved in many human cancers.  Sonidegib effectively inhibits the regulator called smoothened (Smo), preventing the hedgehog pathway from functioning.  As a result, tumours that depend on the hedgehog pathway are unable to grow. (1)"
1373,"Used as an anticoagulant during plasmophoresis as well as a neutralizing agent in the treatment of upset stomach and acidic urine [FDA Label] [L788] [L789].Sodium citrate is the sodium salt of citric acid. It is white, crystalline powder or white, granular crystals, slightly deliquescent in moist air, freely soluble in water,  practically insoluble in alcohol. Like citric acid, it has a sour taste.   From the medical point of view, it is used as alkalinizing agent. It works by neutralizing excess acid in the blood and urine. It has been indicated for the treatment of metabolic acidosis.Citrate prevents activation of the clotting cascade by chelating calcium ions. Citrate neutralizes acid in the stomach and urine, raising the pH [L790].  Citrate chelates free calcium ions preventing them from forming a complex with tissue factor and coagulation factor VIIa to promote the activation of coagulation factor X [A19410] [A19411]. This inhibits the extrinsic initiation of the coagulation cascade. Citrate may also exert an anticoagulant effect via a so far unknown mechanism as restoration of calcium concentration does not fully reverse the effect of citrate [A19410]. Citrate is a weak base and so reacts with hydrochloric acid in the stomach to raise the pH. It it further metabolized to bicarbonate which then acts as a systemic alkalizing agent, raising the pH of the blood and urine [L790]. It also acts as a diuretic and increases the urinary excretion of calcium."
1374,"Iopromide, as the product IOVIST, is approved by the FDA for use as an intra-arterial or intravenous X-ray contrast agent.[L46906] For intra-arterial administration, iopromide is indicated for cerebral arteriography, peripheral arteriography, coronary arteriography, left ventriculography, visceral angiography, and aortography in adults and radiographic evaluation of cardiac chambers and related arteries in pediatric patients aged 2 years and older.[L46906] For intravenous administration, iopromide is indicated for excretory urography in adults and pediatric patients aged 2 years and older, contrast Computed Tomography (CT) of the head and body (intrathoracic, intra-abdominal, and retroperitoneal regions) for the evaluation of neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions in adults and pediatric patients aged 2 years and older, and contrast mammography to visualize known or suspected lesions of the breast in adults, as an adjunct following mammography and/or ultrasound.[L46906]    Iopromide is also approved by Health Canada as an intravascular contrasting agent, although the indications differ depending on the dosage. At 300 mg I/mL, iopromide is indicated for computed tomography (CT), excretory urography, pediatric excretory urography, renal arteriography, peripheral arteriography (bifemoral pelvis/leg), cerebral arteriography, phlebography of the extremities, and arthrography.[L46911]  Iopromide is a low osmolar, non-ionic X-ray contrast agent for intravascular administration. It functions as a contrast agent by opacifying blood vessels in the flow path of the contrast agent, permitting radiographic visualization of the internal structures until significant hemodilution occurs.[A225366] Although iopromide can cause several serious adverse effects, including cardiac events, thromboembolism, hypersensitivity reaction, and even death if administered intrathecally inadvertently, it is still deemed to have a favorable safety profile, with only 0.7% of patients in a 2 years study experiencing adverse events.[A260751] Although the mechanism is unclear, women and outpatients tend to have a higher incidence of adverse events compared to other population groups.[A260751]    Approved by the FDA in 1995 and Health Canada in 1994 under the brand name ULTRAVIST, iopromide is used in radiological diagnosis, including, but not limited to, intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (IA-DSA), cerebral and peripheral arteriography, peripheral venography, excretory urography, brain computer tomography (CT), coronary arteriography, left ventriculography, visceral angiography, and orthography.[L46906,L46911]After intravenous injection, opacification of the renal parenchyma begins within 1 minute. Excretion of the contrast agent becomes apparent in 1 to 3 minutes with optimal contrast in the calyces and collecting system occurring between 5 and 15 minutes. In nephropathic conditions, particularly when excretory capacity has been altered, the excretion rate varies unpredictably and opacification may be delayed for several hours after injection.[L46911] the degree of contrast enhancement is related to the iodine concentration in the tissue of interest.[L46906]   Iopromide is a nonionic iodinated, water-soluble, radiographic contrast medium that is available in two stable, ready-to-use solutions of different concentrations (i.e., 300 mg I/mL and 370 mg I/mL). Following intravascular injection, iopromide provides radiographic opacification of the vasculature and extracellular space in the path of flow of the agent, allowing diagnostic assessment of the limbs and internal organs until significant dilution occurs.[L46911] "
1375,"Indicated for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder with depression, panic disorder and insomnia. it differs from BDZs in having a benzene ring replaced with a thiophene ring. It is an agonist at GABA-A receptors and possesses amnesic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, hypnotic, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. Initially introduced in 1983 in Japan as treatment for neurological conditions such as anxiety and sleep disorders, etizolam is marketed in Japan, Italy and India. It is not approved for use by FDA in the US; however it remains unscheduled in several states and is legal for research purposes.Etizolam is a CNS depressant with anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative-hypnotic and muscle relaxant effects. It acts on the benzodiazepine site of the GABA-A receptor as an agonist to increase inhibitory GABAergic transmission throughout the central nervous system. Studies indicate that etizolam mediates its pharmacological actions with 6 to 10 times more potency than that of diazepam. Clinical human studies performed in Italy showed clinical effectiveness of etizolam in relieving symptoms in patients with generalized anxiety disorders with depressive symptoms [A19772, A19773, A19774].Etizolam is an antagonist at platelet-activating-factor (PAF) receptor and attenuates the recurrence of chronic subdural hematoma after neurosurgery in clinical studies [L884]. It is shown to inhibit PAF-induced bronchoconstriction and hypotension [A19775].Etizolam is selectively a full agonist at GABA-A receptors to increase GABAergic transmission and enhance GABA-induced Cl- currents [A19771]. It is reported to bind to the benzodiazepine binding site which is located across the interface between the alpha and gamma subunits. Benzodiazapines are reported to only bind to receptors that contain gamma 2 and alpha 1/2/3/5 subunits [T28]. Alpha-1-containing receptors mediate the sedative effects of etizolam whereas alpha-2 and alpha-3 subunit-containing receptors mediate the anxiolytic effect [T28]. Etizolam shows high potency and affinity towards GABA-A receptor with alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2S subunit combination [A19771]. By binding to the regulatory site of the receptor, etizolam potentiates GABA transmission by facilitating the opening of GABA-induced chloride channels [T28].  Etizolam is a specific antagonist at PAFR. It inhibits PAF-induced platelet aggregation by inhibiting PAF binding to the receptors located on the surface of platelets with an IC50 of 22nM [A19775]."
1376,"Indicated in the treatment of symptoms of depressive illness, especially where an anti-anxiety effect is required.Dosulepin (INN, BAN) formerly known as dothiepin (USAN), is a tricyclic antidepressant with anxiolytic properties that is used in several European and South Asian countries, as well as Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand. It is not FDA-approved due to low therpeutic index and significant toxicity in overdose. Dosulepin inhibits the reuptake of biogenic amines, increasing available neurotransmitter levels at the synaptic cleft. The use of dosulepsin is only recommended in patients who are intolerant or unresponsive to alternative antidepressant therapies. Dosulepsin is a thio derivative of [DB00321] with a similar efficacy to that of [DB00321], and also exhibits anticholinergic, antihistamine and central sedative properties [L882].   Its hydrochloride form is a common active ingredient in different drug formulations.Dosulepin is a tricyclic antidepressant that interacts with various receptors and transporters. It is a monoamine reuptake inhibitor with approximately equal potency for noradrenaline and 5-HT that increases the availability of these neurotransmitters at the central synapses [L882]. The metabolites of dosulepin are shown to inhibit 5HT uptake by the human blood platelet [A19753].By binding to noradrenaline transporter (NAT) and serotonin transporter (SERT) in an equipotent manner and inhibiting the reuptake activity, dosulepin increases the free levels of noradrenaline and 5HT at the synaptic cleft. It is shown that the main metabolite northiaden is a more potent inhibitor of noradrenaline uptake than the parent drug [A19758].     Dosulepin displays affinity towards α2-adrenoceptors and to a lesser extent, α1-adrenoceptors [A6584]. Inhibition of presynaptic α2-adrenoceptors by dosulepin facilitates noradrenaline release and further potentiates the antidepressant effects [A19758]. It also downregulates central β-adrenoceptors by causing a decline in the number of receptors and reduces noradrenaline-induced cyclic AMP formation [L881, A19758].   Dosulepin binds to 5HT1A and 5HT2A receptors in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus as an antagonist. 5HT1A receptors are autoreceptors that inhibit 5HT release and 5HT2A receptors are Gi/Go-coupled receptors that reduces dopamine release upon activation [T28]. Antagonism at 5HT2A receptors may also improve sleep patterns. Dosulepin also binds to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and causes antimuscarinic side effects such as dry mouth. By acting as an antagonist at histamine type 1 (H1) receptors, dosulepin mediates a sedative effect.     Main metabolites northiaden, dothiepin sulphoxide and northiaden sulphoxide may also bind to 5HT, α2 and H1 receptors, although with less affinity compared to the parent drug [A19755]."
1377,"Dasabuvir is indicated for the treatment of patients with HCV genotype 1a with [DB00811] or genotype 1b without [DB00811] including those with compensated cirrhosis [FDA Label].Dasabuvir is a direct acting antiviral medication used as part of combination therapy to treat chronic Hepatitis C, an infectious liver disease caused by infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as Dasabuvir. Dasabuvir is a non-nucleoside NS5B inhibitor which binds to the palm domain of NS5B and induces a conformational change which renders the polymerase unable to elongate viral RNA [FDA Label]. The binding sites for non-nucleoside NS5B inhibitors are poorly conserved across HCV genotypes leading to the restriction of Dasabuvir's use to genotype 1 only.    In a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend Dasabuvir as first line therapy in combination with [DB09296], [DB09297], and [DB00503] for genotype 1b and with [DB00811] for genotype 1a of Hepatitis C [L852]. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626]. [DB00811].Dasabuvir is classified as a direct-acting antiviral (DAA) and prevents viral replication in HCV genotype 1 [FDA Label].Dasabuvir is a non-nucleoside inhibitor of the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase encoded by the NS5B gene, which is essential for replication of the viral genome [FDA Label]. Based on drug resistance mapping studies of HCV genotypes 1a and 1b, dasabuvir targets the palm domain of the NS5B polymerase, and is therefore referred to as a non-nucleoside NS5B-palm polymerase inhibitor. The EC50 values of dasabuvir against genotype 1a-H77 and 1b-Con1 strains in HCV replicon cell culture assays were 7.7 nM and 1.8 nM, respectively.     By binding to NS5b outside of the active site of the enzyme, dasabuvir induces a conformational change thereby preventing further elongation of the nascent viral genome [A19593, FDA Label]. A limitation of binding outside of the active site is that these binding sites are poorly preserved across the viral genotypes. This results in a limited potential for cross-genotypic activity and increased potential for development of resistance. Dasabuvir is therefore limited to treating genotypes 1a and 1b, and must be used in combination with other antiviral products. "
1378,"Viloxazine is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor indicated for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adults and pediatric patients 6 years and older.[L41685]Viloxazine is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor.[L41685] For decades, an immediate-release formulation of viloxazine has been used in Europe as an antidepressant. It was first approved in the UK in 1974; however, the immediate-release formulation was discontinued due to business reasons unrelated to drug safety and efficacy. In the US, viloxazine was assigned an orphan drug designation in 1984 under the brand name CATATROL: while this product was intended to treat cataplexy and narcolepsy, the drug was never approved for these therapeutic indications. In April 2021, an extended-release formulation of viloxazine under the brand name QELBREE was approved by the FDA for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).[A247985]Viloxazine is a serotonin-norepinephrine modulating agent that has been used as a treatment for depression and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).[A247985] Although it is not a stimulant agent, viloxazine produces amphetamine-like CNS stimulant effects without a risk for drug abuse or dependence.[A247115] Viloxazine does not produce sedative anticholinergic or adrenergic effects.[A19781,A247115] Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder in children characterized by inattention and hyperactivity. In current literature, the pathophysiology of ADHD is understood to involve the imbalance of neurotransmitters, especially dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE).[A247115] The mechanism of action of viloxazine has not been fully elucidated; however, viloxazine is believed to work by modulating the monoaminergic neurotransmitter systems. Viloxazine is a selective and moderate norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that binds to the norepinephrine transporter and inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine.[A247985,L41685] It thereby increases extracellular norepinephrine levels across several brain regions.[A247985] Viloxazine potentiates serotonergic effects: it was shown to enhance neuronal sensitivity to serotonin and increase serotonin levels in the brain.[A247645,A247985] In vitro, viloxazine is an antagonist at 5-HT2B receptors and an agonist 5-HT2C receptors.[A247115,A247645] 5-HT2B receptors expressed on GABAergic interneurons are involved in tonic inhibitory control of serotonin neurons that innervate the medial prefrontal context; thus, antagonism of 5-HT2B receptors may result in disinhibition and enhanced serotonin release in the brain region.[A247985] There is conflicting evidence in the literature that viloxazine increases dopamine levels in the brain via direct or indirect effects. For example, the norepinephrine transporter is also involved in the reuptake of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex [A247985] and stimulation of 5-HT2C receptors facilitates DA release and enhances dopaminergic transmission in the brain.[A247645] As dopamine dysregulation in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala is implicated in ADHD pathophysiology, the impact of viloxazine on dopamine levels may contribute to its mechanism of action. However, there is insufficient evidence to conclude this. Viloxazine has a negligible impact on dopamine in the nucleus accumbens and is not associated with an abuse risk.[A247985]"
1379,"Nisoxetine is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) developed in the 1970s.

1382,"Developed by Takeda Pharmaceuticals in the early 1980s, it is considered the prototypical compound for the thiazolidinedione class.    Ciglitazone was never used as a medication, but it sparked interest in the effects of thiazolidinediones. Several analogues were later developed, some of which—such as pioglitazone and troglitazone—made it to the market.    Ciglitazone significantly decreases VEGF production by human granulosa cells in an in vitro study, and may potentially be used in ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Ciglitazone is a potent and selective PPARγ ligand with an EC50 of 3.0 µM. It is also an anti-hyperglycemic agent in the ob/ob murine model in vivo. Ciglitazone increases adipogenesis, decreases differentiation and angiogenesis in human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC), and osteoblastogenesis in human mesenchymal stem cells."
1383,"Synephrine, also referred to as, p-synephrine, is naturally occurring alkaloid. It is present in approved drug products as neo-synephrine, its m-substituted analog. p-synephrine and m-synephrine are known for their longer acting adrenergic effects compared to norepinephrine.    The similarity of naming between m-synephrine and the unsubstituted form, synephrine,  is a source of some confusion however m-synephrine refers to a related drug more commonly known as phenylephrine. While the compounds share some chemical and pharmacological similarities, they are in fact distinct chemical entities."
1384,"Artinolol was introduced to be used as an antihypertensive agent since 1986.[T88] It has been studied for other functions like tremor control for patients with Parkinson disease and it is currently in clinical trials for its use in the control of blood pressure and heart rate.[L1168]Arotinolol is an alpha- and beta-receptor blocker developed in Japan. It is a thiopropanolamine with a tertiary butyl moiety. It has been studied for its potential to be an antihypertensive therapy.[T87] Artinolol is being developed by Sumitomo Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and it is currently under clinical trials.[L1168]Preclinical studies showed a lack of intrinsic sympathomimetic activities or membrane-establishing properties. It is confirmed that arotinolol presents vasorelaxant activity. This characteristic is also proved to be mainly mediated by its α1-blocking property. In preclinical hypertension trials, there is a specific acute bradycardiac and antihypertensive activity with a pronounced reduction in heart rate. Some reports indicate a delayed development of hypertension when arotinolol is administered daily. Arotinolol has a dose-dependent decrease in cardiac contractility and coronary blood flow as well as an increase in total peripheral resistance. The effects of arotinolol have been confirmed in clinical trials where this drug was able to decrease cardiac index and thus, blood pressure.[T87]Arotinolol binds to the β1-, β2- and α1- adrenergic receptor sites with a very high affinity. Radioligand studies have shown that arotinolol presents a higher affinity to the β-receptor compared to the α-receptor. The elucidated mechanism of action seems to be the result of a reduction in the cardiac output via the β-blockade and an additional inhibition of the counter-regulatory increase in peripheral resistance mediated by the α-blockade.[T87]"
1385,"By the WHO, moxisylyte is indicated for the symptomatic management of sequelae of cerebral infarction or hemorrhage.[T91] The cerebral infarction is characterized by the blockage of the artery either by the formation of a thrombus or an embolus.[A31644]     On the other hand, the FDA classified moxisylyte for the reversal of phenylephrine-induced mydriasis in patients who have narrow anterior angles and are at risk of developing an acute attack of angle-closure glaucoma.[L1172]  Closed-angle glaucoma is caused by the contact between the iris and the trabecular meshwork. This contact will damage the aqueous outflow by the meshwork thus, increasing eye pressure and producing the symptoms of glaucoma.[A31645] Mydriasis is referred to the dilatation of the pupils and this standard body function is known to be a trigger factor for the development of acute closed-angle glaucoma.This risk is explained by the generation of a pupillary block, which is the contact between the pupillary margins and the lens, thus preventing flow from the aqueous humor to the anterior chamber and followed by an increased pressure gradient.[L1173]     Moxisylyte is also approved in France as the first drug for the treatment of impotence.[A31647]Moxisylyte, denominated as thymoxamine in the UK, is a specific and orally active α1-adrenergic antagonist.[T45] According to the WHO, moxisylyte is approved since 1987[T91] and in the same year, it acquired the denomination of orphan product by the FDA.[L1172] This drug was developed by the Japanese company Fujirebio and also by the American company Iolab in the late 80s.Administration of moxisylyte has shown to improve peripheral flow in occlusive arterial disease with little effect in blood pressure. There are reports of increases in cutaneous blood flow and skin temperature after local application of moxisylyte.[T45]Moxisylyte is vasodilator that works as a specific alpha-adrenergic blocking agent.

In gout patients treated with pegloticase, the conversion of uric acid to allantoin leads to lower plasma uric acid concentrations.[L42425]     Pegloticase has a longer terminal elimination half-life thanks to the addition of a polyethylene glycol (PEG) group. Therefore therapeutic drug levels can be maintained with infrequent and relatively low pegloticase doses.[A249980] The PEG group also gives pegloticase a lower potential to induce an immune response.[A249980] However, cases of anaphylaxis and infusion reactions have been reported in patients treated with this drug.[L42425] Pegloticase was approved by the FDA in 2014.[L42425]Pegloticase is a uricase enzyme conjugated with mPEG with an average degree of substitution of 40.8 moles of mPEG/mole of protein.[L42430] In patients treated with 8 mg of pegloticase, mean plasma uric acid levels were 0.7 mg/dL approximately 24 hours after the first dose.[L42425] In comparison, subjects in the placebo group had a mean plasma uric acid level of 8.2 mg/dL. The decrease in plasma uric acid was sustained for long periods. Patients treated with 8-12 mg of pegloticase had a uric acid concentration equal to or lower than 6 mg/dL for more than 300 h.[L42425]    Cases of anaphylaxis have been reported in patients treated with pegloticase. In most cases, anaphylaxis manifests within 2 hours of infusion; however, delayed hypersensitivity reactions may also occur. Anaphylaxis risk is higher in patients with uric acid levels above 6 mg/dL.[L42425] In patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, pegloticase may lead to life-threatening hemolytic reactions and methemoglobinemia. Patients treated with pegloticase may also experience infusion reactions, gout flares, and congestive heart failure.[L42425]Gout is characterized by the presence of hyperuricemia, a biochemical abnormality where the concentration of serum urate is higher or equal to 6.8 mg/dl.[A18541] Pegloticase is a PEGylated recombinant modified mammalian urate oxidase (uricase) that converts uric acid into allantoin, an inert and highly water-soluble metabolite, with hydrogen peroxide and carbon dioxide as by-products of this reaction.[L42425,L42430,A250010] Allantoin is excreted by the kidneys, and this reduces the amount of uric acid in serum.  The reduction in serum uric acid induces a concentration gradient that promotes the migration of urate from joints and tissues, making it readily available for allantoin conversion.[L42425,L42430]"
1387,"Limaprost is used for the improvement of various ischemic symptoms such as ulcer, pain and feeling of coldness associated with thromboangiitis obliterans as well as improvement of subjective symptoms (pain and numbness of lower legs) and gait ability associated with acquired lumbar spinal canal stenosis (in patients with bilateral intermittent claudication showing normal SLR test result).Limaprost (as Limaprost alfadex; CAS number 88852-12-4) is an oral prostaglandin E1 analog. Prostaglandins act on a variety of cells such as vascular smooth muscle cells causing constriction or dilation, on platelets causing aggregation or disaggregation and on spinal neurons causing pain. Prostaglandins have a wide variety of actions, including, but not limited to muscular constriction and mediation of inflammation. Limaprost alfadex has been shown to improve peripheral circulatory failure with a vasodilator action and an antithrombotic effect. It also improves poor blood flow in the nerve tissue in cervical spondylosis and normalizes nerve function. Limaprost alfadex was discovered from collaborative research between Ono Pharmaceutical (Ono) and Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma (DSP). It was approved for the treatment of ischemic symptoms such as skin ulcer, pain and coldness accompanying thromboangiitis obliterans in 1988; and for the treatment of subjective symptoms such as pain and numbness in the lower leg and walking disability associated with acquired lumbar spinal canal stenosis as an additional indication in 2001. The drug has been sold under the trade name of Opalmon® Tablets by Ono and Prorenal® Tablets by DSP. In 2011, Ono and DSP initiated Phase II clinical trials in Japan for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome. In 2013, these trials were discontinued because the study failed to demonstrate efficacy. Ono and DSP also discontinued the development of limaprost alfadex for the additional indication of cervical spondylosis in 2008 due to the failure to demonstrate the anticipated efficacy in a Phase II study in patients with the disease. However, it was verified by Seoul National University Hospital in November of 2014 that the study on the efficacy of oral limaprost alfadex after surgery for cervical myelopathy was still ongoing.Limaprost produces vasodilation to improve blood flow to the extremities and increase cutaneous temperature [FDA Label].As a prostglandin E1 analog, limaprost acts as an agonist at prostraglandin E2 receptors. It likely stimulates the adenylate cyclase coupled E2 subtype of these receptors to produce smooth muscle relaxation [A19717]. "

It is marketed under the trade name Loxonin in Brazil, Mexico and Japan by Sankyo, as Loxomac in India, and as Oxeno in Argentina. A transdermal preparation was approved for use in Japan in January 2006.Loxoprofen is a non-selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase enzymes, which are responsible for the formation of various biologically active pain, fever, and inflammatory mediators. These include prostaglandins, prostacyclin, thromboxane, and arachidonic acid.[L1227,L1228]Loxoprofen itself is a prodrug and carries little-to-no pharmacological activity - it is rapidly metabolized to its trans-alcohol form, which is a potent and non-selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase.[A27797] Cyclooxygenase (COX) is present in 2 forms, COX-1 and COX-2, with each serving different functions. COX-1 is present in human cells and is constitutively released,  performing cellular housekeeping functions such as mucus production and platelet aggregation.[L1228]  COX-2 is induced in human cells post-injury or due to other stimuli, is triggered to appear in large quantities at the sites of injury/stimuli, and is ultimately responsible for the mediation of inflammation and pain.[L1228]    Loxoprofen's active metabolite inhibits both COX isoforms, resulting in reduced expression of several mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever (e.g. prostaglandins, prostacyclin, thromboxane, etc).[L1228]"

1392,"In the information for tolfenamic acid, it is stated that this drug, being an NSAID, is effective in treating the pain associated with the acute attack of migraines in adults.[L1293]Tolfenamic acid, with the formula N-(2-methyl-3-chlorphenyl)-anthranilic acid, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent.[A31824] It was discovered by scientists at Medica Pharmaceutical Company in Finland. It is used in the UK as a treatment for migraine under the name of Clotam.[L1292] In the US, it presents a Status class I by the FDA. By the European Medicine Agency, it was granted in 2016 with the status of orphan for the treatment of supranuclear palsy.[L1291]Studies have shown that tolfenamic acid presents a non-dose dependent partial inhibition of irritant-induced temperature rise as well as a dose-dependent inhibition of skin edema. By studying its NSAID properties more closely, it was noted a dose-related inhibition of serum thromboxane which indicated the inhibition of COX-1. In the same line, there was noted a inhibition of prostaglandin E2 synthesis which marks a related COX-2 inhibition.[A31842] The maximal inhibition of thromboxane was greater than 80% as well as is proven to be a potent prostaglandin E inhibitor.[A31843]Tolfenamic acid inhibits the biosynthesis of prostaglandins, and it also presents inhibitory actions on the prostaglandin receptors.[A31824] As commonly thought, the mechanism of action of tolfenamic acid is based on the major mechanism of NSAIDs which consists of the inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 pathways to inhibit prostaglandin secretion and action and thus, to exert its anti-inflammatory and pain-blocking action. Nonetheless, some report currently indicates that tolfenamic acid inhibits leukotriene B4 chemotaxis of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes leading to an inhibition of even 25% of the chemotactic response. This activity is a not ligand specific additional anti-inflammatory mechanism of tolfenamic acid.[A31844]"

It currently approved for veterinary use in dogs and horses under the brand names Equioxx and Previcox. Firocoxib was the first COX-2 inhibitor approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for horses. Firocoxib is not intended or approved for use in human medicine.
1394,"Indicated for the prevention and treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris and reduction in the risk of acute coronary syndromes. Nicorandil is an orally efficacious vasodilatory drug and antianginal agent marketed in the UK, Australia, most of Europe, India, Philippines, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. It is not an approved drug by FDA. It is a niacinamide derivative that induces vasodilation of arterioles and large coronary arteries by activating potassium channels. It is often used for patients with angina who remain symptomatic despite optimal treatment with other antianginal drugs [T28]. Nicorandil is a dual-action potassium channel opener that relaxes vascular smooth muscle through membrane hyperpolarization via increased transmembrane potassium conductance and increased intracellular concentration of cyclic GMP. It is shown to dilate normal and stenotic coronary arteries and reduces both ventricular preload and afterload [A20325].Nicorandil is a potassium channel opener with nitrovasodilator (NO donor) actions, making it both an arterial and a venous dilator [T28]. It causes sustained dilation of both the arterial resistance and conductive vessels that increases coronary blood flow, however the effect of the drug on coronary arteries does not involve the coronary steal phenomenon [L887]. Activation of potassium channels lead to hyperpolarization of the smooth muscle cells, followed by arterial dilation and afterload reduction. Nicorandil is shown to increase pooling in the capacitance vessels with a decrease in preload through relaxing the venous vascular system. Overall, improved blood flow and reduced infarct size are achieved through reduction of end-diastolix pressure and decreased extravascular component of vascular resistance [L887]. Open studies showed the effectiveness of nicorandil treatment on various types of angina pectoris [A20327]. Nicorandil mediates its therapeutic efficacy via two main mechanisms. Nicorandil is an activator and opener of ATP-sensitive (ATP-dependent) potassium channels (KATP channels) that are composed of Kir6.x-type subunits and sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) subunits. Nicorandil binding sites are located in the sulfonylurea receptor 2 (SUR2) in the ATP-sensitive potassium channel [A20322], which are regulatory subunits of the channel that exhibit an ATPase activitiy [A12436]. There are 2 types of SUR2 subunits (2A/2B) that have identical nucleotide binding domains (NBD), where SUR2A is more predominantly expressed in skeletal and cardiac myocytes and SUR2B in smooth muscle cells [A12436]. Nicorandil more potently activates SUR2B/Kir6.2 than SUR2A/Kir6.2 channels to cause hyperpolarization. ATP-NBD1 interaction influences the channel signalling by nicorandil, and the response of the channel to nicorandil is also facilitated and heightened by the interaction of ATP or ADP with NBD2 [A20321]. Potentiated activity of ATP-sensitive channels have cardioprotective role by limiting the duration of action potentials and preventing intraceullar calcium overload [A20326]. This attenuates cellular injury by preserving cellular energetics and ultimately cell survival [A20324]. KATP channel-dependent membrane hyperpolarization can also lead to vasodilation via reduction in Ca2+ influx through the voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and regulation of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in smooth muscle cells [A20324].   Nicorandil contain a nitrate moiety in its structure, making it a good dilator of vascular smooth muscle like other nitroglycerin esters [A20323]. Direct relaxation of venous vascular system arises from NO-donor mediated stimulation of guanylyl cyclase and increased levels of intracellular cyclic GMP (cGMP). Elevated levels of cGMP contributes to the total relaxing effect of nicorandil at higher concentrations of the drug [A7839]. "
1395,"Peptic ulcer disease, dyspepsia [L1308].Polaprezinc is a chelated form of zinc and L-carnosine. It is a zinc-related medicine approved for the first time in Japan, which has been clinically used to treat gastric ulcers [L1307, L1308].  It was determined that polaprezinc may be effective in pressure ulcer treatment [A31856].Used to treat/manage peptic ulcer disease or irritation of the gastrointestinal tract by promoting tissue healing by the elimination of free radicals [A7840].Polaprezinc increases the expression of various antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD-1), SOD-2, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px), peroxidredoxin-1 (PRDX1; PRXI) and PRXD5 (PRXV).     This process occurs in the gastric mucosa, defending mucosal cells against reactive oxygen species. This drug inhibits the activity of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB) and decreases the expression of various inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL) 1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a).     Polaprezinc also promotes the expression of numerous growth factors, including as platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and nerve growth factor (NGF), in addition to various heat shock proteins (HSPs), including HSP90, HSP70, HSP60, HSP47, HSP27, and HSP10. This process promotes tissue growth and protects against damage the gastric mucosa [L1308]."
1396,"Used for the treatment of schizophrenia [L1097].Blonanserin is an atypical antipsychotic approved in Japan in January, 2008. It offers improved tolerability as it lacks side effects such as extrapyramidal symptoms, excessive sedation, or hypotension. As a second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic, it is significantly more efficacious in the treatment of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia compared to first-generation (typical) antipsychotics.Blonanserin antagonizes dopamine and serotonin receptors to reduce symptoms of schizophrenia [A31487].Blonanserin binds to and inhibits dopamine receptors D2 and D3 as well as the serotonin receptor 5-HT2A with high affinity [A31487]. Blonanserin has low affinity for other dopamine and serotonin receptors as well as muscarinic, adrenergic, and histamine receptors. This reduces dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission which is thought to produce a reduction in positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia respectively."
1397,"For the treatment of schizophrenia, sleep, disorders, agitation and mentally confused states [L1317, L1319, L1322].  Melperone is an atypical antipsychotic of the butyrophenone chemical class, making it structurally related to the typical antipsychotic haloperidol.  Melperone has been used for a span of greater than 30 years in the European Union [L1316]. It has been well established in the treatment of confusion, anxiety, restlessness (particularly in the elderly) and schizophrenia as It is known to be well-tolerated with an excellent safety profile. Recently, it has been studied as a treatment of psychosis related to Parkinson's disease [L1316].Melperone has been demonstrated to produce an antipsychotic effect at doses that cause minimal extrapyramidal symptoms frequently associated with more traditional antipsychotics [L1317, L1319].  Melperone demonstrates antagonist activity at D2 dopaminergic and 5HT2A serotonergic receptors [L1319]. It has a weak affinity to D2 receptors and possesses less risk of inducing dopamine receptor supersensitivity after both acute and chronic administration [L1346].  In addition, the ratio of dopamine D4/D2 occupancy for melperone has been shown to resemble the binding profile of clozapine [L1321]."
1398,"Zotepine, like other atypical antipsychotics, is considered as the first-line treatment in newly diagnosed schizophrenia. It is usually thought to be an option of choice for managing acute schizophrenic episodes when discussion with the patient is not possible. Zotepine, as an atypical antipsychotic, is used in patients who are suffering unacceptable side effects from conventional antipsychotics or in relapse patients that were inadequately controlled.[T108]     It is important to consider that the indications stated above are related to atypical antipsychotics, that zotepine is not currently FDA, Canada or EMA approved and that studies have not shown any additional benefit when compared with other approved atypical antipsychotics.[A31857]    Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe mental disorder that affects how a person thinks, feels and behaves. It is usually marked for a loose reality perspective delineated by hallucinations, delusions and thought and movement disorders.[L1320]Zotepine, with the formula (2-chloro-11-(2-dimethyl-amino-ethoxy)-dibenzo thiepin, is a neuroleptic drug. It was designed and synthesized by Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co Ltd.[A31855] It has been used as an antipsychotic in Japan, India and some places in Europe like UK and Germany since 1980's.[A31857] Zotepine was never approved by the FDA. In 1993, it was classified as inactive drug substance (Status I, Type II) and in 1995 the FDA studied the manufacturing procedures of Zotepine tablets in Germany, but the status remained inactive.[L1082] When the analysis of antipsychotics was retaken in 2016 by the FDA, zotepine did not reach the threshold effect to be further studied.[L1313]. In the EMA, by 2015 it was under pharmacovigilance studies for the potential treatment of acute renal failure.[L1314]In preclinical studies, zotepine is characterized by the presence of a strong antiserotonergic activity when compared with other neuroleptic drugs. It has also been reported to present elevations in the seizure threshold in the amygdaloid nucleus.[A31855] When zotepine's effects were analyzed by electroencephalography, it was noted a typical response of a low-potency neuroleptics of the sedative type. Administration of zotepine has shown improvements in numerical movements and complex reaction. These effects tend to be accompanied by increases in pulse rate, increase in prolactin levels and some typical neuroleptic side effects.[A31863, A31864]Zotepine is a dopamine antagonist that has a high affinity for D1- and D2-like receptors. It presents a strong antagonism for several serotonin receptors, such as 5-HT2a, 5-HT2c, 5-HT6 and 5-HT7. Zotepine activities are also related to the inhibition of noradrenaline reuptake and serotonergic activity. All these effects allow zotepine to improve the negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia.[T109]"
1399,"Aranidipine has been used for many years to treat angina pectoris and hypertension.[A31895]Aranidipine is a novel dihydropyridine derivative that gives rise to two active metabolites (M-1α and M-1β) that exhibit hypotensive activity. It is a calcium antagonist with the formula methyl 2-oxopropyl 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-4-(2-nitrophenyl)-3,5-pyridinedicarboxylate.[A31895] It was developed by Maruko Seiyaku, introduced by Taiho and launched in Japan in 1997.[T88]Pre-clinical studies with aranidipine and its two metabolites have shown production of increases in femoral blood flow. It has been shown to present potent and long-lasting vasodilating actions. Aranidipine and its metabolites are shown to inhibit calcium-induced contraction in isolated rabbit arteries.[A31895] Studies have shown that aranidipine is more potent to reduce blood pressure than other dihydropyridines.[A31896] Aranidipine produce changes in renal blood flow, this effect may be explained by its effect on alpha-2-adrenoreceptor-mediated vasoconstriction.[A31898]The high potential of aranidipine is thought to be related to the additional calcium antagonistic activity of its metabolite. The mechanism is thought to be related to the capacity of aranidipine and its metabolites to vasodilate afferent and efferent arterioles. this action is performed through the inhibition of voltage-dependent calcium channels.[A31896] The typical mechanism of action of aranidipine, as all dihydropyridines, is based on the inhibition of L-type calcium channels, decreasing calcium concentration and inducing smooth muscle relaxation.[A31897] It is a selective alpha2-adrenoreceptor antagonist which inhibits vasoconstrictive responses.[T88]"
1400,"For the treatment of hypertension.Azelnidipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. It is marketed by Daiichi-Sankyo pharmaceuticals, Inc. in Japan.  It has a gradual onset of action and produces a long-lasting decrease in blood pressure, with only a small increase in heart rate, unlike some other calcium channel blockers [L1379]. It is currently being studied for post-ischemic stroke management [L1380]. Azelnidipine is a vasodilator that induces a gradual decrease in blood pressure in hypertensive patients. Unlike other members of its drug class, azelnidipine does not induce reflex tachycardia due to vasodilation. This is likely due to the fact that it elicits a gradual fall in blood pressure    It also exhibits a prolonged hypotensive effect and has been shown to have a strong anti-arteriosclerotic action in vessels due to its high affinity for vascular tissue and antioxidative activity [A31944].     Clinical studies have demonstrated that azelnidipine markedly reduced heart rate and proteinuria in hypertensive patients by inhibiting sympathetic nerve activity. Azelnidipine has also been confirmed to have cardio-protective, neuroprotective, and anti-atherosclerotic properties, and has also been found to prevent insulin resistance [A31944].Azelnidipine inhibits trans-membrane Ca2+ influx through the voltage-dependent channels of smooth muscles in vascular walls. Ca2+ channels are classified into various categories, including L-type, T-type, N-type, P/Q-type, and R-type Ca2+ channels. The L-type Ca2+ channels [L1382].    Normally, calcium induces smooth muscle contraction, contributing to hypertension.  When calcium channels are blocked, the vascular smooth muscle does not contract, resulting in relaxation of vascular smooth muscle walls and decreased blood pressure."
1401,"Cilnidipine is indicated for the management of hypertension for end-organ protection.[L1436] It is reported to be useful in elderly patients and in those with diabetes and albuminuria. Cilnidipine has been increasingly used in patients with chronic kidney disease     Hypertension is the term used to describe the presence of high blood pressure. The blood pressure is generated by the force of the blood pumped from the heart against the blood vessels. Thus hypertension is caused when there is too much pressure on the blood vessels and this effect can damage the blood vessel.[L1438]Cilnidipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist. It was jointly developed by Fuji Viscera Pharmaceutical Company, Japan and Ajinomoto, Japan and approved in 1995. Compared with other calcium antagonists, cilnidipine can act on the N-type calcium channel that existing sympathetic nerve end besides acting on L-type calcium channel that similar to most of the calcium antagonists. This drug is approved in China, Japan, Korea, India, and several countries in the European Union.[A31970]Administration of cilnidipine has been shown to present an antisympathetic profile in vitro and in vivo. It decreases blood pressure safely and effectively without excessive blood pressure reduction or tachycardia.[A32002]Cilnidipine acts on the L-type calcium channels of blood vessels by blocking the incoming calcium and suppressing the contraction of blood vessels, thereby reducing blood pressure. Cilnidipine also works on the N-type calcium channel located at the end of the sympathetic nerve, inhibiting the emission of norepinephrine and suppressing the increase in stress blood pressure.[A32002]"
1402,"Lacidipine is a lipophilic dihydropyridine calcium antagonist with an intrinsically slow onset of activity. Due to its long duration of action, lacidipine does not lead to reflex tachycardia [A31536]. It displays specificity in the vascular smooth muscle, where it acts as an antihypertensive agent to dilate peripheral arterioles and reduce blood pressure. Compared to other dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, lacidipine exhibits a greater antioxidant activity which may confer potentially beneficial antiatherosclerotic effects [A31540]. Lacidipine is a highly lipophilic molecule that interacts with the biological membranes. Through radiotracer analysis, it was determined that lacidipine displays a high membrane partition coefficient leading to accumulation of the drug in the membrane and slow rate of membrane washout [A31539]. When visualized by small-angle X-ray diffraction with angstrom resolution to examine its location within the membranes, lacidipine was found deep within the membrane's hydrocarbon core [A31539]. These results may explain the long clinical half-life of lacidipine [A31539].     In randomised, well-controlled trials, administration of daily single-dose lacidipine ranging from 2-6 mg demonstrated comparable antihypertensive efficacy similar to that of other long-acting dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, thiazide diuretics, atenolol (a beta-blocker) and enalapril (an ACE inhibitor) [A31536]. It is available as once-daily oral tablets containing 2 or 4 mg of the active compound commonly marketed as Lacipil or Motens. It is not currently FDA-approved.acidipine is a specific and potent calcium antagonist with a predominant selectivity for calcium channels in the vascular smooth muscle. Its main action is to dilate predominantly peripheral and coronary arteries, reducing peripheral vascular resistance and lowering blood pressure [L1126].     Following the oral administration of 4 mg lacidipine to volunteer subjects, a minimal prolongation of QTc interval has been observed (mean QTcF increase between 3.44 and 9.60 ms in young and elderly volunteers) [L1126].By blocking the voltage-dependent L-type calcium channels, it prevents the transmembrane calcium influx [A31537]. Normally, calcium ions serve as intracellular messengers or activators in exictable cells including vascular smooth muscles. The influx of calcium ultimately causes the excitation and depolarization of the tissues. Lacidipine inhibits the contractile function in the vascular smooth muscle and reduce blood pressure. Due to its high membrane partition coefficient, some studies suggest that lacidipine may reach the receptor via a two-step process; it first binds and accumulates in the membrane lipid bilayer and then diffuses within the membrane to the calcium channel receptor [A31543]. It is proposed that lacidipine preferentially blocks the inactivated state of the calcium channel [A31543].    Through its antioxidant properties shared amongst other dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, lacidipine demonstrates an additional clinical benefit. Its antiatherosclerotic effects are mediated by suppressing the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent inflammatory actions by chemokines, cytokines and adhesion molecules, thus reducing atherosclerotic lesion formation [A31540]. Lacidipine may also suppress cell proliferation and migration in smooth muscle cells and suppress the expression of matrix metalloproteinases, which affects the stability of atheromatous plaques [A31540].

1403,"For the treatment of mild to moderate essential or primary hypertension [L1025]. Effective as most first-line antihypertensives when used as monotherapy [A27137].Moxonidine is a new-generation centrally acting antihypertensive drug approved for the treatment of mild to moderate essential hypertension. It is suggested to be effective in cases where other agents such as thiazides, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers are not appropriate or irresponsive. As well, moxonidine has been shown to present blood pressure-independent beneficial effects on insulin resistance syndrome.Antihypertensive agent whose site of action is the Central Nervous System (CNS), specifically involving interactions with I1- imidazoline and alpha-2-adrenergic rececptors within the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RSV). [FDA label]Stimulation of central alpha 2-adrenergic receptors is associated with sympathoadrenal suppression and subsequent reduction of blood pressure. As this class was further explored it was discovered that sympathoadrenal activity can also be suppressed by a second pathway with a newly discovered drug target specific to imidazolines [A27150]. Specifically, moxonidine binds the imidazoline receptor subtype 1 (I1) and to a lesser extent αlpha-2-adrenoreceptors in the RSV causing a reduction of sympathetic activity, reducing systemic vascular resistance and thus arterial blood pressure. [FDA label]    Moreover, since alpha-2-adrenergic receptors are considered the primary molecular target that facilitates the most common side effects of sedation and dry mouth that are elicited by most centrally acting antihypertensives, moxonidine differs from these other centrally acting antihypertensives by demonstrating only low affinity for central alpha-2-adrenoceptors compared to the aforementioned I1-imidazoline receptors [FDA Label]."
1404,"For the treatment of major depression.    It is being studied in the treatment of fibromyalgia pain syndrome. One study determined that the effect of pirlindole on sensorimotor performance while driving a motor vehicle shows many similarities to that of placebo. The drug appears to stimulate the central nervous system, rather than exhibit a sedative effect, like many antidepressants.  Because of its selective, reversible inhibition of monoamine oxidase (MAO-A) and short half-life, unpleasant ""cheese effects"" are avoided. This refers to the effects of consuming tyramine-rich foods, such as cheese while medicated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors, leading to severe headaches and hypertension [L1395].  of The available evidence supports pirlindole as a safe and effective treatment option for the management of depression and fibromyalgia syndrome [L1394].       This drug is classified as a reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A enzyme (also known as a RIMA drug). It was developed and is currently used as an antidepressant in Russia. Its chemical structure is similar to metralindole, and it also shares pharmacological properties with this drug.    Pirlindole is a selective, reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO) subtype A (MAO-A) that is approved in several European and non-European countries for the treatment of major depression. The antidepressant efficacy and safety of pirlindole have been demonstrated in numerous studies and, supported by many years of clinical experience in the treatment of depression. Pirlindole's efficacy and safety have also been shown in the treatment of fibromyalgia.Pirlindole regulates that metabolism of norepinephrine and catecholamines, leading to relief of depressive symptoms. The prevention of breakdown of these neuromodulators is thought to elevate mood.This drug is a selective and reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (also known as MAO-A).  Its main mechanism of action is selective and reversible inhibition of monoamine oxidase A. Its secondary mechanism of action is the inhibition effect of noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine reuptake [A31953]."
1405,"For the treatment of major depressive disorder. Toloxatone is an antidepressant agent, the first ever use of which was in France, 1984. It acts as a selective  and reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase-A (MOA) [L1388].This drug has been shown to help manage the symptoms of depression by maintaining neuro-synaptic levels of serotonin and catecholamines while regulating their metabolism, which leads to relief of depressive symptoms [A7848].This medication is a reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase type-A (also known as RIMA).    MAO-A can be found in norepinephrinergic and serotonergic neurons and regulates the metabolism of serotonin and catecholamines, allowing for increased circulation in the synaptic cleft.   Traditional monoamine oxidase inhibitors irreversibly inhibit monoamine oxidase and therefore, side effects, drug interactions, and food interactions persist as long as 2-3 weeks after discontinuing toloxatone. The elevation of serotonin and norepinephrine levels occurs rapidly after medication administration. However, the therapeutic relief of depressive symptoms requires weeks of daily treatment to observe results. Selective and reversible MAO-A inhibitors are more effective in treating major depression without several of the drug and food interactions associated with traditional monoamine oxidase inhibitors [L1389].  "
1406,"For the treatment of depression.Iproclozide is an irreversible and selective hydrazine class based monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). Although it was employed as an antidepressant for a time, the fact that the agent is capable of causing fulminant hepatitis and that its use has been documented as the cause for at least three reported fatalities has resulted ultimately in the agent being discontinued."
1407,"Dextran is used as the restoration of blood mass during surgical interventions if there is hypovolemia due to trauma or dehydration. It is as well used after the presence of hemorrhage in cases of blood loss to a level inferior to 15% of the blood mass, if compatibility test cannot be completed or when blood lots need to be tested for pathogen detection. Dextran is also used for the prevention of profound postoperative venous thrombosis.[L1455]    Dextran as well presents ophthalmic applications as solutions or ointments for the temporary relief of xerophthalmia or minor ocular irritations.[L1461]Dextran is a polysaccharide that differs from others in that its glucose units are joined together 1:6 glucoside links. The main chain of glucose has short branches at frequent intervals which are probably joined by 1:3 and 1:4 glucoside links. The chains can be composed of about 200,000 glucose units.[A32011] Many bacteria, like _Leuconostoc_, can synthesize dextran from sucrose, and this activity is used commercially to obtain dextran.[T121]    Dextran 40 is a sterile, nonpyrogenic preparation of low molecular weight dextran (average mol. wt. 40,000) in 5% Dextrose Injection or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection. It is administered by intravenous infusion.    Dextran 75 is a complex branched glucan with an average molecular weight 75000 Daltons. It is produced from certain bacteria that with α-1,6 glycosidic linkages between glucose molecules and α-1,3 linkages between branches. When labelled with technetium Tc99m, dextran 75 is intravenously administered as an imaging agent to detect and diagnose conditions in the vascular compartment such as pericardial effusion or ventricular aneurysm.It is reported that dextran presents an effect on the hemostatic system in particular by prolonging bleeding time. In the same trials, dextran is reported to reduce emboli, reduce platelet adhesiveness and produce hemodilution. These effects have been showed to be greater proportionally with the increase in the molecular weight of the dextran.[A32013]In preclinical studies, the mechanism of action is thought to be related to the blockage of the uptake of tissue plasminogen activator by mannose-binding receptors. This process has a direct effect by enhancing endogenous fibrinolysis.[A32013]"
1408,"Indicated for the treatment of cancer.Indicated for the first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer with [DB03419] and calcium folinate [L934]. Tegafur (INN, BAN, USAN) is a prodrug of [DB00544] (5-FU), an antineoplastic agent used as the treatment of various cancers such as advanced gastric and colorectal cancers. It is a pyrimidine analogue. Tegafur is usually given in combination with other drugs that enhance the bioavailability of the 5-FU by blocking the enzyme responsible for its degradation, or serves to limit the toxicity of 5-FU by ensuring high concentrations of 5-FU at a lower dose of tegafur [L933]. When converted and bioactivated to 5-FU, the drug mediates an anticancer activity by inhibiting thymidylate synthase (TS) during the pyrimidine pathway involved in DNA synthesis. 5-FU is listed on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.Tegafur is an antineoplastic agent that belongs in the class of pyrimidine analogues. It interferes with the 2'-deoxythymidylate (DTMP) synthesis in the pyrimidine pathway, resulting in inhibition of DNA synthesis [T28]. In a phase III trial investigating the clinical efficacy of S-1 (tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil) in patients with advanced or recurrent gastric cancer, treatment resulted in a high response rate and was associated with a longer overall survival and longer progression-free survival rate when used in combination with cisplatin [A20336]. In a meta analysis, triple combination therapy consisting of tegafur, gimeracil and oteracil showed longer survival times and well tolerance in patients with advanced gastric cancer [A20338]. Tegafur and its active metabolites are potent myleosuppressive agents [L933]. The transformation of 2'-deoxyurindylate (dUMP) to 2'-deoxythymidylate (dTMP) is essential in driving the synthesis of DNA and purines in cells [T28]. Thymidylate synthase catalyzes the conversion of dUMP to dTMP, which is a precursor of thymidine triphosphate (TTP), one of the four deoxyribonucleotides required for DNA synthesis [A31546]. After administration into the body, tegafur is converted into the active antineoplastic metabolite, fluorouracil (5-FU). In tumour cells, 5-FU undergoes phosphorylation to form the active anabolites, including 5-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP) [L933]. FdUMP and reduced folate are bound to thymidylate synthase leading to formation of a ternary complex which inhibits DNA synthesis [L933]. In addition, 5-fluorouridine-triphosphate (FUTP) is incorporated into RNA causing disruption of RNA functions [L933]."
1409,"By the FDA, reviparin is indicated for the treatment of deep vein which may lead to pulmonary embolism in pediatric patients. It is also indicated for the long-term treatment of acute deep vein thrombosis with or without pulmonary embolism in pregnant patients.[L1469]Reviparin is a low molecular weight heparin which seems to have a better safety profile than unfractionated heparin.[A32019] It is prepared from porcine intestinal mucosa by nitrous acid depolymerization. Reviparin has a molecular weight of 3.9 kDa.[A32021] It was developed by Abbott laboratories and in 2009, reviparin presented an orphan drug designation by the FDA.[L1469]Reviparin is been shown to present significant inhibition of smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation in human cell cultures without affecting endothelial cell growth.[A32019]"
1410,"Lixisenatide is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adult patients with type II diabetes mellitus.[L48405]Lixisenatide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist used in the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It is sold by Sanofi-Aventis under the brand name Adlyxin in the US[L763] and Lyxumia in the EU.[L764] Adlyxin recieved FDA approval July 28, 2016.[L763]Lixisenatide acts as an agonist at the GLP-1 receptor. In the pancreas, this agonism results in increased glucose-stimulated insulin exocytosis by beta islet cells. This produces a reduction in blood glucose due to increased glucose uptake by tissues.[A19192] GLP-1 receptor activation in the GI tract results in delayed gastric emptying which is thought to mediate the effects of lixisenatide on postprandial blood glucose.The activation of the GLP-1 receptor by lixisenatide results in the activation of adenylyl cyclase.[A19193] This increases the concentration of cyclic adenosine monophosphate in the cell leading to the activation of protein kinase A (PKA) as well as Epac1 and Epac2.  PKA, Epac1, and Epac2 are involved the in release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum which is known as the ""amplification"" pathway which increases insulin release when the triggering pathway is activated. By activating this amplification pathway lixisenatide increases glucose stimulated insulin secretion."
1411,Cimetropium is a semi-synthetic belladonna alkaloid and derivative of scopolamine. It is a potent antimuscarinic and an effective antispasmodic drug. It is also endowed of a direct myolitic action which partially accounts for its antispasmodic activity. It has never been approved for use in the U.S. or Canada.
1412,"Indicated for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchial asthma and pulmonary disease with spastic bronchial component.Doxofylline is a methylxanthine derivative with the presence of a dioxolane group in position 7. As a drug used in the treatment of asthma, doxofylline has shown similar efficacy to theophylline but with significantly fewer side effects in animal and human studies. In contrast with other xanthine derivatives, doxofylline does not significantly bind to adenosine alpha-1 or alpha-2 receptors and lacks stimulating effects. Decreased affinity for adenosine receptors may account for the better safety profile of doxofylline compared to theophylline [L1169]. Unlike theophylline, doxofylline does not affect calcium influx and does not antagonize the actions of calcium channel blockers which could explain reduced cardiac adverse reactions associated with the drug [A7885]. The anti-asthmatic effects of doxophylline are mediated by other mechanisms, primarily through inhibiting the activities of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzyme.Doxofylline is a methylxanthine bronchodilator with potent bronchodilator activity comparable to that of theophylline. In animal studies, doxofylline demonstrated to attenuate bronchoconstriction, inflammatory actions and the release of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) when challenged with platelet-activating factor [L1169].     Doxofylline does not demonstrate direct inhibition of any histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes or known PDE enzyme isoforms and did not act as an antagonist at A2 or A2 receptors. The affinity for adenosine A1, A2A and A2B receptors are reported to be all higher than 100 µM [A31643]. It only displays an inhibitory action against PDE2A1 and antagonism at adenosine A(2A) at high concentrations [A31642]. A study demonstrated that doxofylline interacts with β2-adrenoceptors to induce blood vessel relaxation and airway smooth muscle relaxation. In dog studies, doxofylline decreased airway responsiveness at a dose that did not affect heart rate and respiratory rate [A31643].The main mechanism of action of doxofylline is unclear. One of the mechanisms of action of is thought to arise from the inhibition of phosphodiesterase activity thus increasing the levels of cAMP and promoting smooth muscle relaxation.     The interaction of doxofylline with beta-2 adrenoceptors was demonstrated by a study using nonlinear chromatography, frontal analysis and molecular docking [A31646]. Serine 169 and serine 173 residues in the receptor are thought to be critical binding sites for doxofylline where hydrogen bonds are formed [A31646]. Via mediating the actions of beta-2 adrenoceptors, doxofylline induces blood vessel relaxation and airway smooth muscle relaxation.     There is also evidence that doxofylline may exert anti-inflammatory actions by reducing the pleurisy induced by the inflammatory mediator platelet activating factor (PAF) according to a rat study [A31646]. It is suggested that doxofylline may play an important role in attenuating leukocyte diapedesis, supported by mouse preclinical studies where doxofylline administration was associated with inhibited leukocyte migration across vascular endothelial cells in vivo and in vitro [A31643].Unlike theophylline, doxofylline does not inhibit tumor necrosis factor-induced interleukin (IL)-8 secretion in ASM cells."

1414,"Used as a antidote to treat poisonings following excessive oral ingestion of certain medications or poisons. Activated charcoal, or activated carbon, is an amorphous form of carbon prepared from incomplete combustion of carbonaceous organic matter. It is activated by an oxidizing gas flow at high temperature passed over its surface to make a fine network of pores, producing a material with large surface area and high affinity for various substances. It is used as a gastric decontaminant and emergency medication to treat poisonings following excessive oral ingestion of certain medications or poisons by absorbing most drugs and toxins. However its effects is rendered poor on some compounds including strong acids or bases, methanol and substances with limited absorptive capacity (including iron, lithium, arsenic). It works by binding to the poison in the gastric contents in a reversible fashion thus may be adminstered together with a cathartic to reduce the small intestine transit time. The clinical applications of activated charcoal occured in the early 1800's. While this management for acute poisoning is considered fairly invasive, it is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines that includes the most important medications needed in a basic health system.Activated charcoal is used as a gastric decontamination agent in emergency clinical settings in case of poison or medication overdose. Studies show that early administration of one dose of activated charcoal can adsorb poison in the stomach and reduce absorption while it also works long after ingestion, by interruption of enterohepatic and enterovascular cycling of poison. Active charcoal acts by binding to the pharmaceutical drugs or poisons such as organophosphates and decreasing the systemic absorption of toxic agents. Molecules with large volume of distribution, thus likely having higher lipid solubility, tends to bind have better absorptive binding to activated charcoal. Following the administration of activated charcoal, cathartics are indicated to evacuate the charcoal-poison bonded complex from the gastrointestinal tract.   Activated charcoal may also have an effect on systemic drug levels by lowering the serum levels of already absorbed drugs or toxins. Many absorbed drugs that undergo significant hepatic metabolism and conjugation are eliminated via bile into the small intestines. When they reach the small intestines, drug conjugates can undergo hydrolysis and return to the enterohepatic circulation. Activated charcoal interferes with this process and binds to the conjugated drug before hydrolysis or the free deconjugated drug before reabsorption. "
1415,"For the treatment of peptic ulcers.  Relieving indigestion and heartburn.Magnesium trisilicate is an inorganic compound that is used as an antacid in the treatment of peptic ulcers.Magnesium trisilicate works by increasing  the pH of gastric juice via a neutralisation reaction. It also precipitates colloidal silica, which can coat gastrointestinal mucosa conferring further protection.The gelatinous silicon dioxide, formed by the reaction of magnesium trisilicate with gastric contents is said to protect ulcerated mucosal surfaces and favor healing. "
1416,"Treatment of chronic psychoses and states of aggressiveness of various origins [L1515].Pipamperone is a typical antipsychotic of the _butyrophenone_ family used in the treatment of schizophrenia. It was developed by Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1961 and started its first round of clinical trials in 1963 [L1514, L1518].    In an effort to improve [haloperidol]'s pharmacological effects, Janssen discovered that pipamperone, an agent whose pharmacological profile was distinct from haloperidol and all other known antipsychotic drugs at this time, had significant anti-tryptamine activity. Some studies suggest pipamperone was the first atypical antipsychotic. Interestingly, when [risperidone] was created, Janssen suggested it was a more potent version of pipamperone. Synthesized in the year 1984, risperidone’s pharmacological properties were similar to pipamperone’s in that both block more serotonin more potently than dopamine [L1518].Pipamperone is an antipsychotic medication that has sedative effects, which may be beneficial in the management of agitation and disordered sleep [A32062]. Pipamperone, showing antidopaminergic and anti-serotonergic properties, has been noted for its anti-  agitation effects and for its ability to normalize sleep rhythms in psychiatric patients [A12816].  One study showed that pipamperone increased the expression of D4 (dopaminergic) receptors, explaining its helpfulness in decreasing positive psychotic symptoms, such as delusions and hallucinations [L1524].Pipamperone binds mainly to 5-HT2A receptors, with a nearly equal affinity to D4 receptors and a moderate affinity for 5-HT2C, D2, D3, 1- and 2B-adrenoceptors [A12816].    This drug is a selective 5-HT2A, D1 and D4 antagonist [L1516, A32057]. Extrapyramidal adverse effects also appear to be limited in pipamperone treatment compared to traditional antipsychotic medications due to its high receptor selectivity [L1514].    Pipamperone has a 15-fold higher affinity for D4 than D2 receptors. It has been suggested that D4 receptors may play a role in the modulation of GABAergic neuronal activity by dopamine [A12816].    "
1417,"Used primarily in the treatment of major depressive disorder and anxiety [A31969]. It is currently being studied for fibromyalgia pain treatment [L1426].Tianeptine is a drug used primarily in the treatment of major depressive disorder and has been studied in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) [A31983]. Structurally, it is classified as a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), however, it possesses different pharmacological properties than typical tricyclic antidepressants [A31969].    Tianeptine was discovered and patented by The French Society of Medical Research in the 1960s [L2946]. Currently, tianeptine is approved in France and manufactured and marketed by Laboratories Servier SA; it is also marketed in several other European countries under the trade name “Coaxil” as well as in Asia (including Singapore) and Latin America as “Stablon” and “Tatinol” but it is not available in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the U.K. or the U.S.    Analyses in large-scale epidemiologic surveys have shown that the anxiety disorders are widely comorbid with major depression. This makes antidepressant with anxiolytic properties particularly unique and attractive [A31971].    Tianeptine is effective in reducing depressive symptoms in mild to severe major depressive disorder and also alleviates anxious symptoms associated with depression without the need for coadministration of an anti-anxiety medication [A31971].       These findings, however, are met with controversial data.  In a study of healthy volunteers, Tianeptine-treated subjects were less accurate at identifying facial expressions, suggesting a lack of improvement in the psychomotor symptoms of depression. The tianeptine group also showed reduced memory and reduced attentional vigilance to various stimuli [A31987].Recent studies suggest that tianeptine acts as a full agonist at the mu-type opioid receptor (MOR) [A33314], [A33316].   The mu opioid receptors are currently being studied as effective targets for antidepressant therapies [L2947]. It is believed that the clinical effects of tianeptine are owed to its modulation of these receptors  [A33314].  In addition to its actions on the opioid receptor, previous studies have owed its action to its effect on the serotonin receptor [A33317], [A33318], dopamine (D2/3) receptors [A33319], and glutamate receptors [A33315], [F134], as discussed below:    Tianeptine has challenged the monoaminergic hypothesis of depression, as well as the widely supported monoaminergic mechanisms whereby the action of most known antidepressants have been explained [L1414]. Specifically, this drug is thought to persistently alter glutamate receptor bursting of the hippocampal CA3 commissural associational synapse [A31971]. Current research suggests that tianeptine produces its antidepressant effects through the modulation of glutamate receptor activity (for example, AMPA receptors and NMDA receptors) and affect the release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which impacts neural plasticity [A31986]. More recent studies by support the role of tianeptine in the modulation of glutaminergic activity in the amygdala, the emotional region of the brain associated with memories [A31971].      Tianeptine reduces the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal response to stress, and thus prevents stress-related behavioral issues [A31986, A24914].  In rodents, the stress of acute restraint increases extracellular levels of glutamate in the basolateral amygdala an effect that was inhibited by tianeptine [A31971]. Interestingly, the SSRI fluoxetine increased extracellular glutamate levels in the basolateral amygdala regardless of stress conditions. These data demonstrate that the mechanism of action of tianeptine is distinct from SSRIs and support the hypothesis that the mechanism of action of tianeptine relates to alteration of glutaminergic activity in the amygdala and the hippocampus [A31971, A31969, A31986].    In addition to the above mechanisms, tianeptine is a unique antidepressant and anxiolytic medication that stimulates the uptake of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT), and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in brain tissue [A31971].     Although the monoaminergic neurotransmitters serotonin (5-HT), noradrenaline (NA) and dopamine (DA) are proven to be related to the occurrence of depressive disorders, it is now recognized that monoamine deficits are not sufficient to explain the mechanism of action of antidepressant medications [A31971].    "
1418,"For the treatment of nausea and vomiting and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome in males.Ramosetron is a _serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist_ commonly employed to treat nausea and vomiting, in addition to certain diarrheal conditions. It is believed to have higher potency and longer antiemetic action than other 1st generation 5-HT3 antagonists such as ondansetron. Currently, ramosetron is only approved for use Japan and in certain Southeast Asian countries."
1419,"This drug is indicated in adults for the prevention of delayed nausea and vomiting associated with emetogenic chemotherapy.Rolapitant is a potent, highly selective, long-acting Neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor antagonist approved for the prevention of delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in adults. Delayed-phase CINV typically occurs >24 hours after chemotherapy treatment and is principally mediated by Neurokinin-1 and its ligand Substance P, which is released in the gut following chemotherapy administration. Neurokinin-1 is also known as Tachykinin Receptor 1 (TACR1), Neurokinin 1 Receptor (NK1R), and Substance P Receptor (SPR).   By blocking Substance P from interacting with NK-1 receptors in the gut and the central nervous system, rolapitant prevents late-phase CINV. Unlike other available NK-1 receptor antagonists, rolapitant is not an inhibitor of Cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4 and has a long elimination half-life, allowing a single dose to prevent both acute and late-phase CINV during the first 120 hours post-chemotherapy.Rolapitant is an orally active, highly selective Neurokinin-1 Receptor (NK1R) antagonist. NK1 receptors are located primarily in the gut and central nervous system and are activated by Substance P following chemotherapy administration. By binding to the NK1 receptor, rolapitant prevents binding of its ligand Substance P, which is released in the gut following chemotherapy administration. "
1420,"Ombitasvir is indicated  for the treatment of patients with genotype 4 chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection without cirrhosis [L866]. HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as Ombitasvir. Ombitasvir is an inhibitor of NS5A, a protein essential for viral replication and virion assembly [FDA Label]. The barrier for develoment of resistance to NS5A inhibitors is lower than that of NS5B inhibitors, another class of DAAs [A19593].     In a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend Ombitasvir as a first line therapy option when used in combination with other antivirals for genotypes 1a, 1b, and 4 [L852].  SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626]. Treatment with direct acting antivirals such as Ombitasvir is associated with very minimal side effects, with the most common being headache and fatigue [FDA Label]. Lack of significant side effects and short duration of therapy is a considerable advantage over older interferon-based regimens, which were limited by infusion site reactions, reduced blood count, and neuropsychiatric effects [A19635].    Ombutasvir first came on the market as a fixed-dose combination product with [DB09183], [DB09297], and [DB00503] as the FDA-approved product Viekira Pak. First approved in December 2014, Viekira Pak is indicated for the treatment of HCV genotype 1b without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis, and when combined with Ribavirin for the treatment of HCV genotype 1a without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis.    Ombutasvir is also available as a fixed-dose combination product with [DB09297] and [DB00503] as the FDA- and Health Canada-approved product Technivie. First approved in July 2015, Technivie is indicated in combination with Ribavirin for the treatment of patients with genotype 4 chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis.    In Canada, Ombutasvir is also available as a fixed-dose combination product with [DB09183], [DB09297], and [DB00503] as the Health Canada-approved, commercially available product Holkira Pak. First approved in January 2015, Holkira Pak is indicated for the treatment of HCV genotype 1b with or without cirrhosis, and when combined with [DB00811] for the treatment of HCV genotype 1a with or without cirrhosis.Ombitasvir is classified as a direct acting antiviral and acts against HCV to inhibit viral replication [FDA Label].Ombitasvir is an inhibitor of the HCV non-structural protein 5A. While the precise role of this protein is unknown, it is essential to viral replication and virion assembly [FDA Label]. Potential modes of action of NS5A inhibitors like Elbasvir include blocking signaling interactions, redistribution of NS5A from the endoplasmic reticulum to the surface of lipid droplets, and modification of the HCV replication complex [A19593]."

It is not a pain medication in the normal sense, since it does not directly affect pain, but rather works to prevent painful cramps and spasms from occurring. It is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a basic health system.Scopolamine butylbromide is a muscarinic antagonist which acts to prevent acetylcholine-stimulated contraction of smooth muscle in the gastrointestinal tract [A7905].Scopolamine butylbromide binds to muscarinic M3 receptors in the gastrointestinal tract [A7905]. This prevents acetycholine from binding to and activating the receptors which would result in contraction of the smooth muscle. The inhibition of contraction reduces spasms and their related pain during abdominal cramping."
1423,"Alirocumab is an antibody eliciting proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor activity that is indicated for:    (i) use in reducing the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and unstable angina requiring hospitalization in adults with established cardiovascular disease [F4591], and/or    (ii) use as an adjunct to diet or use alone for the treatment of adults with primary hyperlipidemia (including heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia) to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in the body [F4591].Alirocumab is a biopharmaceutical that obtained FDA approval in July 2015 as a second line treatment for high cholesterol in adults whose LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) is not controlled by the combination of diet and statin treatment. It is a human monoclonal antibody part of the family of the PCSK9 inhibitors which are a novel class of anticholesterol therapeutics. From this family, it was the first agent to receive FDA approval. The FDA approval was contingent on the completion of further clinical trials to better determine efficacy and safety. PCSK9 inhibition facilitates more LDL-C clearance from the blood.Alirocumab reduces levels of PCSK9 in a concentration-dependent manner. Alirocumab is a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds and inhibits proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), an enzyme found to have ""gain of function"" mutations in autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia. PCSK9 is secreted by the liver and typically binds to the LDL receptors in serum and marks them for lysosomal degradation. In result, the LDL receptors are not able to recycle to the plasma membrane, reducing their binding to LDL-C and therefore reducing the clearance of LDL-C from plasma. Therefore by inhibiting PCSK9's actions, alirocumab allows for more LDL-C reuptake by the liver and facilitates a higher rate of clearance. Lower LDL cholesterol concentrations are associated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease."
1424,"Evolocumab is indicated in adult patients with established cardiovascular disease to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary revascularization.[L40644] It is also indicated as an adjunct to diet, alone or in combination with other hypolipidemic treatments, in adults with primary hyperlipidemia (and in pediatric patients ≥10 years old with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia) to reduce LDL-C.[L40644] In addition, it is indicated adjunctly to other hypolipidemic treatments in patients ≥10 years old with homozygous familiar hypercholesterolemia to reduce LDL-C.[L40644]Evolocumab is a monoclonal antibody designed for the treatment of hyperlipidemia by Amgen. It is a subcutaneous injection approved by the FDA for individuals on maximum statin therapy who still require additional LDL-cholesterol lowering. It is approved for both homozygous and heterozygous familial cholesterolemia as an adjunct to other first-line therapies. Evolocumab is a human IgG2 monoclonal antibody that targets the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). PCSK9 is a protein that targets LDL receptors for degradation, therefore reducing the liver's ability to remove LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), or ""bad"" cholesterol, from the blood. Evolocumab is designed to bind to PCSK9 and inhibit PCSK9 from binding to LDL receptors on the liver surface, resulting in more LDL receptors on the surface of the liver to remove LDL-C from the blood. Evolocumab is the second PCSK9 inhibitor on the market, first being alirocumab.Evolocumab is a human IgG monoclonal antibody which targets PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9). PCSK9 is a serine protease produced by the liver which binds LDL receptors and creates a complex to be targeted for lysosomal degradation. LDL receptors typically bind LDL-cholesterol (""bad"" cholesterol) for cellular reuptake, therefore the formation of these complexes with PCSK9 inhibits LDL receptor recycling to the cell surface, resulting in decreased cellular reuptake of LDL-C and increased levels of free LDL-C in the plasma. Individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia often may have ""gain of function"" mutations in the PCSK9 molecules in their body, resulting in increased LDL-C plasma levels and a consequent cardiovascular risk. Evolocumab is able to bind both the normal PCSK9 and the ""gain of function"" mutant, D374Y. The exact mechanism of the binding has not been published, however the precursor molecule, mAb1, is indicative of the interaction. The mAb1 molecule binds on the catalytic site of PCSK9 next to the binding site for the LDL receptor and creates hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, resulting in the steric inhibition of binding between PCSK9 and the LDL receptor. Because the formation of complexes between LDL receptor and PCSK9 are prevented, the internalized LDL receptors are less likely to be degrated by lysosomes and may recycle to the surface of the cell to serve their function of removing LDL from the blood.

1425,"For the treatment of depression [A19792].Setiptiline is a tetracyclic antidepressant (TeCA) which acts as a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA). In Japan, the company Mochida started its commercialization for the treatment of depression started in 1989.Setiptiline is a tertacyclic antidepressant [A19792]. It acts to reduce the symptoms of major depressive disorder.Setiptiline is an antagonist at the α2 adrenergic receptor and at serotonin receptors [A19791, A19793]. The antagonism of the α2 receptors likely relieves presynaptic inhibition of adrenergic neurotransmission, allowing for greater and longer sustained release of noradrenaline into the synapse. The antagonism of serotonin receptors may produce an upregulation of the receptors leading to an eventual increase in serotonergic signalling. The actual physiological mechanisms behind the antidepressant effect of setiptiline is unknown but the listed possibilities exist as likely explanations."
1426,"For routine prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with congenital factor XIII A-Subunit deficiency.Coagulation Factor XIII A-Subunit (Recombinant), also known as catridecacog, is a recombinant form of the Factor XIII-A2 homodimer composed of two factor XIII (FXIII) A-subunits [FDA Label]. For people with congenital deficiency or mutation of Factor XIII, a rare bleeding disorder, exogenous replacement of this key coagulation factor is essential for management and prevention of bleeding episodes.     Also known as Fibrin Stabilizing Factor (FSF), Factor XIII is an endogenously available coagulation factor and the final enzyme within the blood coagulation cascade. Within the body, FXIII circulates as a heterotetramer composed of 2 catalytic A-subunits and 2 non-catalytic B-subunits (FXIII-A2B2) [A32363]. When activated by thrombin at the site of injury, the FXIII A2B2 pro-enzyme is cleaved resulting in activation of the catalytic A-subunit and dissociation from its carrier B-subunit. As a result, the active transglutaminase from subunit A cross-links fibrin and other proteins resulting in increased mechanical strength and resistance to fibrinolysis of the fibrin clot. This contributes to enhanced platelet and clot adhesion to injured tissue, thereby improving blood coagulation and maintenance of hemostasis [A18581].    When supplied as the recombinant form, Coagulation Factor XIII A-Subunit (Recombinant) binds to free human FXIII B-subunit resulting in a heterotetramer (rA2B2) with a similar activity profile and half-life as the endogenously available form. In patients with congenital factor XIII A-subunit deficiency, this product (marketed as Tretten) is indicated for the routine prophylaxis of bleeding. In these patients, activated rFXIII has been shown to increase the mechanical strength of fibrin clots, slow down fibrinolysis, and to enhance platelet adhesion to the site of injury. As the half-life of endogenous Factor XIII is long (5-11 days), prophylactic therapy with the replacement of FXIII can be given every 4-6 to maintain hemostasis[A32363].      Other drug products with similar structure and function to Coagulation Factor XIII A-Subunit (Recombinant) include [DB12909], which is a purified endogenous (human) form of coagulation factor XIII. Compared to Coagulation Factor XIII A-Subunit (Recombinant), which is produced through recombinant DNA technology where the target protein is grown in yeast and then isolated, the human form is isolated from pooled human plasma.    Coagulation Factor XIII A-Subunit (Recombinant) is available in the US as the commmercially available product Tretten, and in the EU as NovoThirteen. Tretten is manufactured as an intracellular, soluble protein in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) production strain containing the episomal expression vector, pD16. It is subsequently isolated by homogenization of cells and purification by several chromatography steps, including hydrophobic interaction and ion exchange chromatography [FDA Label]."
1427,"Polycarbophil is used to treat constipation and to help maintain regular bowel movements.Polycarbophil calcium is a synthetic polymer manufactured from the cross-linking of polyacrylic acid with divinyl glycol and a calcium counter-ion.  Polycarbophil calcium is a stool stabilizer used to treat constipation. This drug may also be used to help relieve the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome or diarrhea.  Less gas and bloating compared to psyllium laxative products, but can cause heartburn, and belly cramps. It is insoluble in water, dilute acids, and dilute alkali. The material possesses exceptionally high water-binding capacity. is not absorbed, does not interfere with the activity of digestive enzymes or intestinal absorption, possesses satisfactory stability, is physiologically inert, and does not cause gastrointestinal irritation.Relieves constipation or diarrhea associated with bowel disorders and acute nonspecific diarrhea.It is known as a bulk-forming laxative. It increases the bulk in the stool, an effect that helps to cause movement of the intestines. It also works by increasing the amount of water in the stool, making the stool softer and easier to pass."
1428,"For prevention of renal transplant rejection and for the treatment of aplastic anemia.Equine anti-thymocyte globulin is composed of purified gamma globulin containing primarily IgG against human thymus lymphocytes. It is formed by inoculating a horse with an antigen (human thymoyctes) which then induces the horse immune system's B-lymphocytes to produce IgG immunoglobulins specific for that antigen. The result is polyclonal IgG that is then purified from the horse's serum to produce a usable drug product that can be used for immunosuppression. Although the exact mechanism of action is unknown, equine anti-thymocyte globulin targets a variety of immune system proteins including lymphocyte surface proteins, granulocytes, platelets, bone marrow cells, and other cell types. Equine ATG is currently indicated for the suppression of the immune system to prevent renal transplant rejection and in the treatment of aplastic anemia. Induction of T cell apoptosis and resulting T-cell lymphopenia found in vivo is credited for its therapeutic effect in these conditions.     There are currently various ATG products available, which differ in the source of  inoculated animal (rabbit, horse, or pig) and in the type of antigen product used to produce immunoglobulin (thymocytes, peripheral T cells, etc.)."
1429,"This medicinal product is for diagnostic use only in adults and children as a low-osmolality medium [L1883], [A7924]. Ioxaglic acid is marketed as Hexabrix. This drug is an ionic tri-iodinated benzoate used as a low-osmolality contrast agent during diagnostic imaging procedures. Like other organic iodine compounds, ioxaglic acid blocks x-rays and is opaque in its appearance on x-ray film, improving the visualization of important structures and organs during angiography, arteriography, arthrography, cholangiography, urography, and computed tomography [L1889].    Ioxaglic acid has a low osmolarity and is associated with fewer side effects compared to older contrast agents [L1883].This drug allows for the visualization of important organs and structures in the body.  It binds to tissues, allowing the blockage of X-rays and diagnostic visualization in various soft tissues and body cavities [L1890].     The joint spaces in addition to the uterus and fallopian tubes may be visualized by the direct injection of the contrast medium into the region to be studied [L1885].Ioxaglic acid is an iodine-containing, low osmolality contrast agent [L1883, L1884, A7924]. Ioxaglate is a molecule that consists of six iodine atoms and achieves water solubility by ionization; thus, it is a 3.0 ratio ionic agent [L1888].      By far the most successful and widely used contrast agents in use today are the iodinated contrast media, which were introduced into clinical practice in the 1950s. Approximately 75 million doses of iodinated contrast agents are administered worldwide each year.  The iodinated contrast agents fall into 4 groups. Each group has unique chemical, physical, and biologic properties. These various contrast agents are required to meet the demands of a broad variety of imaging modalities [L1889].     All agents share a similar function group—a tri-iodinated benzene ring. Iodine plays an imperative role in the attenuation of x-ray signal. The atomic radius of a covalently bonded iodine atom is about 133 picometers, falling within the same range of the wavelengths of x-rays: 10 to 10,000 picometers. Therefore, x-rays are easily attenuated by the iodine atoms. In addition, iodine atoms covalently bonded to a benzene ring have 2 main advantages: (1) 3 large atoms located in such close proximity increase the effective molecular size, attenuating longer-wavelength x-rays, and (2) covalent bonding to a stable organic functional group (for example, benzene) decrease the risk of toxic adverse effects from free iodide molecules [L1889].     Ionization is an important characteristic to note in contrast media preparations [L1890]. Compounds are classified as either ionic or nonionic. The ionic compounds dissociate in aqueous solution and therefore have a higher osmolality. The anion is the radiopaque portion of the molecule, however, both the anion and cation are osmotically active [L1890]. Compared with nonionic media such as ioxaglic acid,  ionic contrast media have more adverse hemodynamic effects, especially in patients with heart disease. The nonionic media are water soluble but do not dissociate in solution. Nonionic agents possess lower osmolality because there are fewer particles in solution. The nonionic contrast agents are more hydrophilic than ionic agents, resulting in lower osmolality, reduced binding to plasma proteins, decreased tissue binding, and a decreased tendency to cross cell membranes [L1890].    The low-osmolality of ioxaglic acid reduces the risk of adverse events. The occurrence of adverse reactions is more common after the use of high-osmolarity agents: about 15% with a high-osmolarity agent versus 3% with a low-osmolarity agent [L1889].     The use of high-osmolarity agents has decreased significantly in recent years. Most adverse effects and adverse reactions to this group of drugs are multifactorial and are likely due to a combination of direct cellular toxicity, the ionic state (for example, ionic vs nonionic), or the osmolarity of the injected contrast drug [L1889]."
1430,"For the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms due to menopause and for the treatment of moderate to severe vaginal dryness, pain with intercourse, and symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy due to menopause.Synthetic conjugated estrogens, B tablets contain a blend of ten synthetic estrogenic substances. The estrogenic substances are: sodium estrone sulfate, sodium equilin sulfate, sodium 17α-dihydroequilin sulfate, sodium 17α-estradiol sulfate, sodium 17β­ dihydroequilin sulfate, sodium 17α-dihydroequilenin sulfate, sodium 17β-dihydroequilenin sulfate, sodium equilenin sulfate, sodium 17β-estradiol sulfate, and sodium Δ8,9-dehydroestrone sulfate. This blend of ten estrogen derivatives are plant-derived forms of endogenous estrogens and contain many of the same compounds as the Conjugated Equine Estrogens (CEEs), although they are not considered to be equivalent. Available as the product Cenestin (FDA), this combination of plant-derived estrogenic compounds is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms, vulvovaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness, and paint with intercourse associated with menopause.     All estrogen products mimic the effects of endogenous estrogens in the body which are responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Estrogens act by binding to estrogen receptors on a wide variety of tissues in the body and modulating the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) through a negative feedback mechanism. Prior to menopause, the primary source of estrogen is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70-500 micrograms of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. However, once a woman stops ovulating there is a sharp decline in the production of progesterone and estradiol by the ovaries and a consequent fluctuation in LH and FSH due to a lack of feedback control. This shift in hormone production is largely responsible for many of the symptoms experienced during and after menopause and includes hot flashes and other vasomotor symptoms, painful intercourse, vaginal dryness, and vulvovaginal atrophy. These symptoms are able to be reduced by replacing many of the hormones lost during and following menopause with synthetic or naturally occurring forms, in a therapy known as Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT).    Pharmacologic estrogen products are available in a variety of formats. Although many of them contain several compounds in common (such as the estrogen derivatives sodium estrone sulfate and sodium equilin sulfate), they vary by their original source (such as horse-, human-, or plant-derived), and the remaining mixture of estrogenic derivatives. Conjugated Equine Estrogens (CEEs) are derived from the urine of pregnant mares and contain a blend of at least 10 estrogen derivatives. Marketed under the brand name Premarin, CEEs are the most frequently used form of conjugated estrogens. There is currently no generic form of CEEs available as a detailed analytical characterization of the active ingredients or of their estrogenic activity is not available at this time. Conjugated estrogens are also available in a plant-derived synthetic form that replicates the naturally occurring, horse-derived forms. Available as either ""Synthetic Conjugated Estrogens, A"" containing 9 estrogen derivatives (available as Cenestin) or as ""Synthetic Conjugated Estrogens, B"" containing 10 estrogen derivatives (available as Enjuvia), these products are isolated as precursors from yam or soy plants and then chemically modified to mimic the products available in their naturally occurring form.All estrogen products mimic the effects of endogenous estrogens in the body which are responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics.

1432,"Acetrizoic acid indication was to be used as a contrast agent for X-ray. Some information indicates its nephrotropic property as one of the characteristics for the utilization of acetrizoic acid.[A32135] The X-ray imaging depends on the difference in tissue density which is provided by an X-ray attenuation between the area of interest and the surrounding tissue. The use of contrast agents will provoke a contrast enhancement or opacification and it will improve the differentiation of pathological processes from normal tissue.[T125]Acetrizoic acid presents the molecular formula of 3-acetamidol-2,4,6-triiodobenzoic acid[L1702] and it is the first monomeric ionic compound used as an X-ray contrast agent.[A32135] It was first synthesized by Wallingford in 1953[A32136] and it was filled in the FDA by the Johnson & Johnson subsidiary, Cilag Chemie AG, on February 8th, 1978.[L1704] Acetrizoic acid presents, in the FDA records, a category of drug substance with an inactive status.[L1703]Iodine, a big component in acetrizoic acid, is an element with a high atomic density.

Thus, acetrizoic acid is a water-soluble and reasonably safe iodinated contrast agent that can be intravenously administered for clinical applications.[A32136]"
1433,"Radiopaque medium usually in oil; used in bronchography.Propyliodone (INN, trade name Dionosil) is a molecule used as a contrast medium in bronchography.It was developed by a team at Imperial Chemical Industries in the late 1930s."
1434,"Polymeric phosphoric acid ester of estradiol.Polyestradiol phosphate (PEP), sold under the brand name Estradurin, is an estrogen medication which is used primarily in the treatment of prostate cancer in men.[It is also used in women to treat breast cancer, as a component of hormone therapy to treat low estrogen levels and menopausal symptoms, and as a component of feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women. It is given by injection into muscle once every four weeks.Common side effects of PEP include headache, breast tenderness, breast development, feminization, sexual dysfunction, infertility, and vaginal bleeding.PEP is an estrogen and hence is an agonist of the estrogen receptor, the biological target of estrogens like estradiol. It is an estrogen ester in the form of a polymer and is an extremely long-lasting prodrug of estradiol in the body. The biological half-life of PEP is more than two months. Because PEP works by being converted into estradiol, it is considered to be a natural and bioidentical form of estrogen.The safety profile of parenteral estradiol esters like PEP is greatly improved relative to synthetic oral estrogens like ethinylestradiol and diethylstilbestrol.PEP was discovered around 1953 and was introduced for medical use in the United States in 1957. Along with estradiol undecylate and estradiol valerate, it has been frequently used in the United States and Europe as a parenteral form of estrogen to treat men with prostate cancer.However, it is no longer available in the United States."
1435,"Norgestrel in combination with ethinyl estradiol is indicated for the prevention of pregnancy in women who elect to use this product as a method of contraception.Norgestrel is synthetic steroidal progestin that is for oral contraception. Norgestrel is composed of a racemic mixture of two stereoisomers, dextronorgestrel and levonorgestrel.  However, only the levorotary enantiomer ([levonorgestrel]) is biologically active.Norgestrel (and more specifically the active stereoisomer levonorgestrel) binds to the progesterone and estrogen receptors within the female reproductive tract, the mammary gland, the hypothalamus, and the pituitary. Once bound to the receptor, progestins like levonorgestrel will slow the frequency of release of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus and blunt the pre-ovulatory LH (luteinizing hormone) surge. Loss of the LH surge inhibits ovulation and thereby prevents pregnancy.  "

Glycerin suppositories usually work within 15 to 30 minutes.When administered rectally, glycerin exerts a hygroscopic and/or local irritant action, drawing water from the tissues into the feces and reflexively stimulating evacuation.   Glycerin decreases intraocular pressure by creating an osmotic gradient between the blood and intraocular fluid, causing fluid to move out of the aqueous and vitreous humors into the bloodstream."
1437,"indicated for bowel cleansing prior to colonoscopy or barium enema X-ray examination.Sodium Sulfate Anhydrous is the anhydrous, sodium salt form of sulfuric acid. Sodium sulfate anhydrous disassociates in water to provide sodium ions and sulfate ions. Sodium ion is the principal cation of the extracellular fluid and plays a large part in the therapy of fluid and electrolyte disturbances. Sodium sulfate anhydrous is an electrolyte replenisher and is used in isosmotic solutions so that administration does not disturb normal electrolyte balance and does not lead to absorption or excretion of water and ions.Induces catharsis by the osmotic effects of the unabsorbed sulfate salts and polyethylene glycol (PEG) in the GI tract. Specifically, sulfate salts provide sulfate anions, which are poorly absorbed, and PEG, which is primarily unabsorbed, causes water to be retained in the GI tract resulting in watery diarrhea.MoviPrep produces a watery stool leading to cleansing of the colon. The osmotic activity of polyethylene glycol 3350, sodium sulfate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium ascorbate, and ascorbic acid, when taken with 1 liter of additional clear fluid, usually results in no net absorption or excretion of ions or water."
1438,"Enalaprilat injection is indicated for the treatment of hypertension when oral therapy is not practical.Enalaprilat is the active metabolite of the orally available pro-drug, [enalapril]. Used in the treatment of hypertension, enalapril is an ACE inhibitor that prevents Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) from transforming angiotensin I into angiotensin II. As angiotensin II is responsible for vasoconstriction and sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule of the kidney, down-regulation of this protein results in reduced blood pressure and blood fluid volume. Enalaprilat was originally created to overcome the limitations of the first ACE inhibitor, captopril, which had numerous side effects and left a metallic taste in the mouth. Removal of the problematic thiol group from captopril resulted in enalaprilat, which was then modified further with an ester to create the orally available pro-drug enalapril.    Enalaprilat is poorly orally available and is therefore only available as an intravenous injection for the treatment of hypertension when oral therapy is not possible.Enalaprilat injection results in the reduction of both supine and standing systolic and diastolic blood pressure, usually with no orthostatic component. Symptomatic postural hypotension is therefore infrequent, although it might be anticipated in volume-depleted patients. The onset of action usually occurs within fifteen minutes of administration with the maximum effect occurring within one to four hours. The abrupt withdrawal of enalaprilat has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure.  The duration of hemodynamic effects appears to be dose-related. However, for the recommended dose, the duration of action in most patients is approximately six hours.  Following administration of enalapril, there is an increase in renal blood flow; glomerular filtration rate is usually unchanged. The effects appear to be similar in patients with renovascular hypertension.Enalaprilat is the active metabolite of the orally available pro-drug, enalapril. Used in the treatment of hypertension, enalapril is an ACE inhibitor that prevents Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) from transforming angiotensin I into angiotensin II.

1441,"Hydroquinone is used as an OTC topical lightening agent for disorders of hyperpigmentation including melasma, post-inflammatory hyperpigmention, sunspots and freckles. Hydroquinone is a topical lightening product found in  OTC products, and is used to correct skin discoloration associated with disorders of hyperpigmentation including melasma, post-inflammatory hyperpigmention, sunspots, and freckles. It can be used alone, but is more frequently found in combination with other agents such as alpha-hydroxy acids, corticosteroids, retinoids, or sunscreen.      Hydroquinone has come under scrutiny due to several complications associated with its use, including dermal irritation, exogenous onchronosis, and carginogenicity. As a result of these concerns, hydroquinone has been banned in the EU and UK.Hydroquinone reduces melanin pigment production through inhibition of the tyrosinase enzyme, which is involved in the initial step of the melanin pigment biosynthesis pathway. Hydroquinone takes several months to take effect. "
1442,"Ointments or liniments containing methyl salicylate are applied topically as counter irritant for relief of acute pain associated with lumbago,sciatica and rheumatic conditions. Local analgesics for human and veterinary medicine.Methyl salicylate (oil of wintergreen or wintergreen oil) is an organic ester naturally produced by many species of plants, particularly wintergreens. The compound was first extracted and isolated from plant species Gaultheria procumbens in 1843. It can be manufactured synthetically and it used as a fragrance, in foods, beverages, and liniments. It forms a colorless to yellow or reddish liquid and exhibits a characteristic odor and taste of wintergreen. For acute joint and muscular pain, methyl salicylate is used as a rubefacient and analgesic in deep heating liniments. It is used as a flavoring agent in chewing gums and mints in small concentrations and added as antiseptic in mouthwash solutions.Methyl salicylate relieve musculoskeletal pain in the muscles, joints, and tendons by causing irritation and reddening of the skin due to dilated capillaries and increased blood flow. It is pharmacologically similar to aspirin and other NSAIDs but as a topical agent it primarily acts as a rubefacient and skin irritant. Counter-irritation is believed to cause a soothing sensation of warmth.Counter-irritation is thought to be effective at alleviating musculoskeletal pain as the irritation of the sensory nerve endings is thought to alter or offset pain in the underlying muscle or joints that are served by the same nerves [A19285]. This is thought to mask the underlying musculoskeletal pain and discomfort. When applied topically, methyl salicylate is thought to penetrate the skin and underlying tissues where it reversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase enzyme and locally and peripherally prevents the production of inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandin and thromboxane A2.

1443,"Necitumumab is approved for a first-line treatment for metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It is not indicated for treatment of non-squamous NSCLC. Necitumumab is an intravenously administered recombinant monoclonal IgG1 antibody used in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as an EGFR antagonist. It functions by binding to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and prevents binding of its ligands, a process that is involved in cell proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis, and malignant progression. Binding of necitumumab to EGFR induces receptor internalization and degradation, thereby preventing further activation of EGFR which is beneficial in NSCLC as many patients have increased protein expression of EGFR. Necitumumab is approved for use in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine as a first-line treatment for metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Necitumumab is an EGFR antagonist that functions by binding to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and preventing binding of its ligands, a process that is involved in cell proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis, and malignant progression. Binding of necitumumab to EGFR induces receptor internalization and degradation."
1444,"Insulin degludec is indicated to improve glycemic control in patients 1 year of age and older with diabetes mellitus.[L42400]Insulin degludec is an ultra-long-acting form of insulin used for the treatment of hyperglycemia caused by Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes.[A18561,A18562,A18563,A18564,A174934] Insulin is typically prescribed for the management of diabetes mellitus to mimic the activity of endogenously produced human insulin, a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas that promotes glucose metabolism.[A18561,A18562,A18563,A18564,A174934] Insulin is released from the pancreas following a meal to promote the uptake of glucose from the blood into internal organs and tissues such as the liver, fat cells, and skeletal muscle.[A18561,A18562,A18563,A18564,A174934] Absorption of glucose into cells allows for its transformation into glycogen or fat for storage.[A18561,A18562,A18563,A18564,A174934] Insulin also inhibits hepatic glucose production, enhances protein synthesis, and inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis among many other functions.[A18561,A18562,A18563,A18564,A174934]    Insulin is an essential treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce or synthesize the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels.[A18561,A18562,A18563,A18564,A174934] As a result, people with T1D rely primarily on exogenous forms of insulin, such as insulin degludec, to lower glucose levels in the blood.[A18561,A18562,A18563,A18564,A174934] Insulin is also used in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), another form of diabetes mellitus that is a slowly progressing metabolic disorder caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors that promote chronically elevated blood sugar levels.[A18561,A18562,A18563,A18564,A174934] Without treatment or improvement in non-pharmacological measures such as diet and exercise to lower blood glucose, high blood sugar eventually causes cellular resistance to endogenous insulin, and in the long term, damage to pancreatic islet cells.[A18561,A18562,A18563,A18564,A174934]     Marketed as the brand name product Tresiba, insulin degludec has a duration of action up to 42 hours allowing for once-daily dosing, typically at bedtime.[A18561,A18562,A18563,A18564,A174934] Due to its duration of action, Tresiba is considered ""basal insulin"" as it provides low concentrations of background insulin that can keep blood sugar stable between meals or overnight. Use of basal and bolus insulin together is intended to mimic the pancreas' production of endogenous insulin, with the goal of avoiding any periods of hypoglycemia.[A18561,A18562,A18563,A18564,A174934]    Compared to endogenous insulin, insulin degludec has an added hexadecanedioic acid on lysine at the B29 position, allowing for the formation of multi-hexamers.[A18561,A18562,A18563,A18564,A174934] When injected subcutaneously, these multi-hexamers form a drug depot store from which monomers are slowly and continuously absorbed into circulation.[A18561,A18562,A18563,A18564,A174934] As a result, Insulin Degludec has a protracted time action profile due to the delayed absorption from subcutaneous tissue depots into the systemic circulation.[A18561,A18562,A18563,A18564,A174934] Compared to available long-acting analogs such as [DB00047] and [DB01307], which have a duration of action of 20-24 hours, insulin degludec provides a consistent level of basal insulin over 42 hours with a low peak: trough ratio.[A18561,A18562,A18563,A18564,A174934] Limitations of shorter-acting analogs include more frequent dosing and less stable pharmacokinetics, which may negatively impact patient adherence and glucose control, particularly nocturnal control.[A18561,A18562,A18563,A18564,A174934]    Without an adequate supply of insulin to promote absorption of glucose from the bloodstream, blood sugar levels can climb to dangerously high levels and can result in symptoms such as fatigue, headache, blurred vision, and increased thirst.[A18561,A18562,A18563,A18564,A174934] If left untreated, the body starts to break down fat, instead of glucose, for energy which results in a build-up of ketone acids in the blood and a syndrome called ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening medical emergency. In the long term, elevated blood sugar levels increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and diabetic neuropathy.[A18561,A18562,A18563,A18564,A174934]    Insulin Degludec was approved by the FDA in September 2015 as the product Tresiba, for use in providing glycemic control to adults with diabetes mellitus.Insulin is a natural hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas. In nondiabetic individuals, the pancreas produces a continuous supply of low basal insulin levels and spikes of insulin following meals.[A18561,A18562,A18563,A18564,A174934] Increased insulin secretion following meals is responsible for the metabolic changes that occur as the body transitions from a postabsorptive to an absorptive state.[A18561,A18562,A18563,A18564,A174934] Insulin promotes cellular uptake of glucose, particularly in muscle and adipose tissues, promotes energy storage via glycogenesis, opposes catabolism of energy stores, increases DNA replication and protein synthesis by stimulating amino acid uptake by the liver, muscle and adipose tissue, and modifies the activity of numerous enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis and glycolysis.[A18561,A18562,A18563,A18564,A174934] Insulin also promotes growth and is required for the actions of growth hormone (e.g. protein synthesis, cell division, DNA synthesis).[A18561,A18562,A18563,A18564,A174934] Insulin detemir is a long-acting insulin analogue with a flat and predictable action profile.[A18561,A18562,A18563,A18564,A174934] It mimics the basal insulin levels in diabetic individuals. The onset of action of insulin detemir is 1 to 2 hours and its duration of action is up to 24 hours. Interestingly, it has a lower affinity (30%) for the insulin receptor than human insulin.[A18561,A18562,A18563,A18564,A174934]Insulin detemir binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units.[A231659] The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor.[A231659] The bound receptor autophosphorylates and phosphorylates numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc, and Gab 1.[A231659] Activation of these proteins leads to activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt.[A231659] Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC), both of which play critical roles in metabolism and catabolism.[A231659]"
1445,"Ixazomib is indicated for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. Ixazomib a second generation proteasome inhibitor (PI) and the first oral PI approved by the FDA in November 2015 for multiple myeloma treatment in combination with 2 other therapies (lenalidomide and dexamethasone) for patients who have received at least 1 prior therapy. It was found to have similar efficacy to bortezomib (the first PI approved for multiple myeloma therapy) in the control of myeloma growth and prevention of bone loss. Ixazomib citrate is marketed by Takeda Pharmaceuticals under the brand name Ninlaro, which is a prodrug that becomes quickly converted to its active metabolite, ixazomib, after administration.In vitro studies have shown ixazomib to induce apoptosis in multiple myeloma cells sensitive or resistant to other conventional therapies.

Its edible and nontoxic properties provide a vegetarian alternative to the use of gelatin.Methyl cellulose polymer consisting of numerous linked glucose molecules used as a stabiliser, thickener and emulsifier for foodstuffs and cosmetics. The Degree of Substitution (DS) of a given form of methyl cellulose is defined as the average number of substituted hydroxyl groups per glucose with a theoretical maximum of 3, however more typical values are 1.3 2.6. Methyl cellulose is a hydrophilic white powder in pure form and dissolves in cold (but not in hot) water, forming a clear viscous solution or gel. It is available under a variety of trade names as a treatment for constipation. Like cellulose, it is not digestible, not toxic, and not allergenicIt increases the bulk in your stool, an effect that helps to cause movement of the intestines. It also works by increasing the amount of water in the stool, making the stool softer and easier to pass.Methylcellulose absorbs water in the gastrointestinal lumen thereby increasing  the bulk of the stool. This leads to distension and stimulation of peristalsis. The ability of methylcellulose to absorb water may contribute to its efficacy in the management of diarrhea by once again increasing the bulk and consistency of the stool."
1449,"Protein C concentrate is indicated for pediatric and adult patients with severe congenital protein C deficiency for the prevention and treatment of venous thrombosis and purpura fulminans.[L12831] It is also found as a component of some prothrombin complex concentrate (i.e. [Factor IX Complex (Human)]) formulations, such as Kcentra.[L12834]Protein C is an endogenously occurring plasma protein that plays a key role within the coagulation cascade. Protein C is a zymogen, or enzyme precursor, of a vitamin K-dependent anticoagulant glycoprotein (serine protease) that is synthesized in the liver. It is converted by the thrombin/thrombomodulin-complex on the endothelial cell surface to Activated Protein C (APC). Once in its activated form, APC functions as a serine protease with potent anticoagulant effects, especially in the presence of its cofactor protein S. APC exerts its effect by inactivating essential components of the coagulation cascade (specifically factors V and VIII), which leads to a decrease in thrombin formation, and therefore a reduction in clot formation.     The Protein C pathway provides a natural mechanism for control of the coagulation system and prevention of excessive procoagulant responses to activating stimuli. A lack of protein C in the body would lead to unchecked coagulation activation, resulting in thrombin generation and intravascular clot formation.    Protein C is available in concentrated form as the product Ceprotin, which is indicated for use in pediatric and adult patients with severe congenital protein C deficiency for the prevention and treatment of venous thrombosis and purpura fulminans.In clinical studies, the intravenous administration of Protein C Concentrate demonstrated a temporary increase, within approximately half an hour of administration, in plasma levels of APC. Replacement of protein C in protein C-deficient patients is expected to control or, if given prophylactically, to prevent thrombotic complications.[L12831]Protein C is an endogenously occurring plasma protein that plays a key role within the coagulation cascade. Also known as blood coagulation factor XIV, Protein C is a zymogen, or enzyme precursor, of a vitamin K-dependent anticoagulant glycoprotein (serine protease) that is synthesized in the liver.

1450,"Selexipag is indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) to delay disease progression and reduce risk of hospitalization.Selexipag was approved by the United States FDA on December 22, 2015 for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) to delay disease progression and reduce risk of hospitalization. PAH is a relatively rare disease with usually a poor prognosis requiring more treatment options to prolong long-term outcomes. Marketed by Actelion Pharmaceuticals under brand name Uptravi, selexipag and its active metabolite, ACT-333679 (MRE-269), act as agonists of the prostacyclin receptor to increase vasodilation in the pulmonary circulation and decrease elevated pressure in the blood vessels supplying blood to the lungs.At the maximum tolerated dose of 1600 mcg twice per day, selexipag was not found to prolong the QT interval to a clinically relevant extent. Both selexipag and its metabolite caused concentration-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation in vitro with IC50 of 5.5 µM and 0.21 µM, respectively. However, at clinically relevant concentrations, there was no effect on platelet aggregation test parameters following multiple dose administration of selexipag in healthy patients. Selexipag is a selective prostacyclin (IP, also called PGI2) receptor agonist. The key features of pulmonary arterial hypertension include a decrease in prostacyclin and prostacyclin synthase (enzyme that helps produce prostacyclin) in the lung. Prostacyclin is a potent vasodilator with anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-thrombotic effects; therefore, there is strong rationale for treatment with IP receptor agonists. Selexipag is chemically distinct as it is not PGI2 or a PGI2 analogue and has high selectivity for the IP receptor. It is metabolized by carboxylesterase 1 to yield an active metabolite (ACT-333679) that is approximately 37 times more potent than selexipag. Both selexipag and its metabolite are selective for the IP receptor over other prostanoid receptors. "

It was used in Italy but has since been withdrawn.Cefroxadine is a cephalosporin antibiotic which produces a bactericidal effect on susceptible bacteria [A7957].Cefrixadine is a cephalosporin antibiotic, a class of β-lactam antibiotics similar to penicillins, which binds to and inhibits penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) [T29]. PBPs are responsible for catalyzing the transpeptidase reaction which cross-links the peptide side chains on the sugar residues of a peptidoglycan unit, adding the unit to the peptidoglycan layer. This disrupts the balance between the hydrolysis of peptidoglycan, in order to insert new peptidoglycan units, by murein hydrolase and the attachment of the new units which leads to overall destruction of the peptidoglycan layer. With the loss of its peptidoglycan layer the cell also loses its resistance to the high osmotic pressure inside its membrane and lyses."

1457,"No approved therapeutic indications on its own. Chlorobutanol, or chlorbutol, is an alcohol-based preservative with no surfactant activity [A32746]. It also elicits sedative-hypnotic and weak local anesthetic actions in addition to antibacterial and antifungal properties. Similar in nature to chloral hydrate, it is formed by the simple nucleophilic addition of chloroform and acetone.     As a long-term stabilizer of multi-ingredient preparations, chlorobutanol is normally used at a concentration of 0.5%. At this concentration, it also conserves its antimicrobial activity.     Due to the long terminal half-life of 37 days, the use of chlorobutanol as a sedative is limited because of the considerable accumulation which will occur following multiple dosing [A32743]. Chlorobutanol is a common detergent preservative in eye drops and other ophthalmic therapeutic formulations [A32744].Chlorobutanol is a detergent preservative with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity [A32744]. _In vitro_, chlorobutanol demonstrated to inhibit platelet aggregation and release via unknown mechanisms [A32739]. A study proposes that the antiplatelet effect of chlorobutanol may occur from inhibition of the arachidonic acid pathway [A32739]. It attenuated thromboxane B2 formation, elevation of cytosolic free calcium, and ATP release, and additionally exhibited a significant inhibitory activity toward several aggregation inducers in a time- and concentration-dependent manner [A32739]. Chlorobutanol may exert a direct negative inotropic effect on myocardial cells to isometric tension produced by the heart [A32740]. Chlorobutanol was shown to induce conjunctival and corneal cell toxicity _in vitro_: at a concentration of 0.1%, Cbl caused near depletion of the squamous layer while degeneration of corneal epithelial cells, generation of conspicuous membranous blebs, cytoplasmic swelling, and occasional breaks in the external cell membrane were observed at a concentration of 0.5% [A32744]. As a detergent, chlorobutanol disrupts the lipid structure of the cell membrane and increases the cell permeability, leading to cell lysis [A32744]. It induces conjunctival and corneal cell toxicity via causing cell retraction and cessation of normal cytokines, cell movement, and mitotic activity [A32744]. It disrupts the barrier and transport properties of the corneal epithelium as well as inhibits the utilization of oxygen by the cornea [A32744]. Chlorobutanol also inhibits oxygen use by the cornea, which increases susceptibility to infection [A32746]."

It is indicated for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.Ixekizumab is a humanized immunoglobulin G subclass 4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody (mAb) against interleukin-17A (IL-17A) and prevents it from interacting with the IL-17A receptor. As IL-17A is a pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in inflammation and immune responses, blocking its effect is beneficial for use in inflammatory conditions. In particular, IL-17A has been found to be implicated in a variety of autoimmune diseases including Rheumatoid Arthritis and plaque psoriasis. "
1481,"Elbasvir for the treatment of chronic HCV genotypes 1 or 4 infection in adults.[L10253]Elbasvir is a direct-acting antiviral medication used as part of combination therapy to treat chronic hepatitis C, an infectious liver disease caused by infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV). HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients.[L852] Treatment options for chronic hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) such as elbasvir. Elbasvir is an inhibitor of NS5A, a protein essential for viral replication and virion assembly.[synthesis] The barrier to the development of resistance to NS5A inhibitors is lower than that of NS5B inhibitors, another class of DAAs.[A19593] Substitutions at amino acid positions 28, 30, 31, or 93 are known to confer resistance to elbasvir.[L10253] Despite this disadvantage elbasvir is still effective against HCV, particularly when paired with [grazoprevir].    Elbasvir is available as a fixed-dose combination product with [grazoprevir] (tradename: Zepatier) used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Approved in January 2016 by the FDA, Zepatier is indicated for the treatment of HCV genotypes 1 and 4 with or without [ribavirin] depending on the presence of resistance-associated amino acid substitutions in the NS5A protein and previous treatment failure with [ribavirin], [peginterferon alfa-2a], [peginterferon alfa-2b], or other NS3/4A inhibitors like [boceprevir], [simeprevir], or [telaprevir].L852]. SVR and eradication of HCV infection are associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality.[A19626]    In a computational target-based drug repurposing investigation published in April 2020, elbasvir was predicted to bind stably and preferentially to three proteins necessary for viral replication of SARS-CoV-2, the human coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.[A193257] While these results are suggestive of antiviral efficacy, follow-up clinical trials are required to validate elbasvir as a potential therapy against SARS-CoV-2.Elbasvir is classified as a direct-acting antiviral (DAA) and prevents viral replication in HCV genotypes 1a, 1b, and 4.[L10253]Elbasvir is an inhibitor of the HCV non-structural protein 5A. While the precise role of this protein is unknown, it is essential to viral replication and virion assembly.[synthesis] Potential modes of action of NS5A inhibitors like elbasvir include blocking signaling interactions, redistribution of NS5A from the endoplasmic reticulum to the surface of lipid droplets, and modification of the HCV replication complex.[A19593]    Computational target-based _in silico_ research suggests that elbasvir may carry activity at several proteins required for replication of SARS-CoV-2 - namely RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, and papain-like proteinase - although specific activity has yet to be affirmed by follow-up clinical studies.[A193257]"
1482,"Grazoprevir is for treatment of chronic HCV genotypes 1a, 1b, or 4 infection in adults. Grazoprevir is a direct acting antiviral medication used as part of combination therapy to treat chronic Hepatitis C, an infectious liver disease caused by infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as Grazoprevir. Grazoprevir is an inhibitor of NS3/4A, a serine protease enzyme, encoded by HCV genotypes 1 and 4 [synthesis]. These enzymes are essential for viral replication and serve to cleave the virally encoded polyprotein into mature proteins like NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B [FDA Label]. The barrier for develoment of resistance to NS3/4A inhibitors is lower than that of NS5B inhibitors, another class of DAAs [A19593]. Subtitutions at amino acid positions 155, 156, or 168 are known to confer resistance. The substitutions of the enzyme's catalytic triad consisting of H58, D82, and S139 are also likely to alter the affinity of the drug for NS3/4A or the activity of the enzyme itself. Despite this disadvantage Grazoprevir is still effective against HCV particularly when paired with [DB11574].    In a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend Grazoprevir as first line therapy in combination with [DB11574] for genotypes 1a, 1b, and 4 of Hepatitis C [A19593].SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626].    Grazoprevir is available as a fixed dose combination product with [DB11574] (tradename Zepatier) used for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C. Approved in January 2016 by the FDA, Zepatier is indicated for the treatment of HCV genotypes 1 and 4 with or without [DB00811] depending on the the presence of resistance associated amino acid substitutions in the NS5A protein and previous treatment failure with [DB00811], [DB00008], [DB00022], or other NS3/4A inhibitors like [DB08873], [DB06290], or [DB05521] [FDA Label]. When combined together, Grazoprevir and [DB11574] as the combination product Zepatier have been shown to achieve a SVR between 94% and 97% for genotype 1 and 97% and 100% for genotype 4 after 12 weeks of treatment [L852]. It can be used in patients with compensated cirrhosis, human immunodeficiency virus co-infection, or severe kidney disease.Grazoprevir is classified as a direct-acting antiviral (DAA) and prevents viral replication in HCV genotypes 1a, 1b, and 4 [FDA Label].Grazoprevir is a second generation NS3/4a protease inhibitor used to inhibit viral HCV replication. NS3/4a protease is an integral part of viral replication and mediates the cleavage the virally encoded polyprotein to mature proteins (NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B) [FDA Label]. Grazoprevir inhibits the NS3/4protease enzymes of HCV genotype 1a, 1B, and 4 with IC50 values of 7pM, 4pM, and 62pM, respectively."
1483,"Venetoclax is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). It is also used in combination with azacitidine, or decitabine, or low-dose cytarabine for the treatment of newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in adults 75 years or older, or who have comorbidities that preclude use of intensive induction chemotherapy.[L39880]Venetoclax is a BCL-2 inhibitor that was initially approved by the FDA in April 2016 [FDA label]. Proteins in the B cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) family are important regulators of the apoptotic (programmed cell death) process [A18565], [A18566].  Venetoclax is used to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and certain types of small lymphocytic lymphoma [FDA label]. CLL is the most prevalent leukemia diagnosed in Western countries [A40022]. Venetoclax was developed through reverse engineering of the BCL-2 protein family inhibitor, navitoclax [A40022]. Venetoclax is approximately 10 times more potent than navitoclax with regard to induction of apoptosis in CLL cells [A40022]. A new indication was approved in 2018 for the treatment patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), with or without 17p deletion, who have received at least one prior therapy [FDA label].  Previously, this drug was indicated only for patients with 17p gene deletion [F2130].Venetoclax induces rapid and potent onset apoptosis of CLL cells, powerful enough to act within 24h and to lead to tumor lysis syndrome  [A40020], [FDA label], [A18566]. Selective targeting of BCL2 with venetoclax has demonstrated a manageable safety profile and has been shown to induce significant response in patients with relapsed CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia) or SLL (small lymphocytic leukemia), including patients with poor prognostic features [A40021].  This drug is not expected to have a significant impact on the cardiac QT interval [FDA label]. Venetoclax has demonstrated efficacy in various types of lymphoid malignancies, including relapsed/ refractory CLL harboring deletion 17p, with an overall response rate of approximately 80% [A40022].Proteins in the B cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) family are necessary regulators of the apoptotic (anti-cell programmed death) process. This family comprises proapoptotic and prosurvival proteins for various cells. Cancer cells evade apoptosis by inhibiting programmed cell death (apoptosis). The therapeutic potential of directly inhibiting prosurvival proteins was unveiled with the development of navitoclax, a selective inhibitor of both BCL-2 and BCL-2-like 1 (BCL-X(L)), which has demonstrated clinical efficacy in some BCL-2-dependent hematological cancers [A18565]. Selective inhibition of BCL-2 by venetoclax, sparing BCL-xL enables therapeutic induction of apoptosis without the negative effect of thrombocytopenia [A40022], [A18565].   Venetoclax helps restore the process of apoptosis by binding directly to the BCL-2 protein, displacing pro-apoptotic proteins, leading to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and the activation of caspase enzymes. In nonclinical studies, venetoclax has shown cytotoxic activity in tumor cells that overexpress BCL-2 [FDA label]."
1484,"Thiocolchicoside is a  skeletal muscle-relaxant drug used in the treatment of orthopedic, traumatic and rheumatologic disorders [L1661]. It is indicated as an adjuvant drug in the treatment of painful muscle contractures and is indicated in acute spinal pathology, for adults and adolescents 16 years of age and older [L1658]. Recent studies have examined its effect on muscle tone, stiffness, contractures, and soreness experienced by athletes during sporting competitions [L1664].Thiocolchicoside is a semi-synthetic derivative of the colchicine, a natural anti-inflammatory glycoside which originates from the flower seeds of _Superba gloriosa_.  It is a muscle relaxant with anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects.  It has potent convulsant activity and should not be administered to individuals prone to seizures.[L1663]Thiocholchicoside is a muscle relaxing agent that works through selective binding to the GABA-A receptor. It prevents muscle contractions by activating the GABA inhibitory motor pathway [L1661].    This medication acts as a competitive GABA receptor antagonist and inhibits glycine receptors with similar potency as nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. It has powerful convulsant activity and should not be used in individuals at risk for seizures [L1661, L1669].    Used in combination with glafenine and meprobamate to tranquilize patients undergoing hysterosalpingography. In the treatment of painful muscle spasms. Thiocolchicoside acts both in contractures with a central cause and in contractures of reflex type, rheumatic and traumatic. It also alleviates symptoms of spastic sequelae of hemiparesis, Parkinson's disease and iatrogenic Parkinson symptoms, particularly neurodyslectic syndrome.  Some other conditions that may benefit from this medication are acute and chronic lumbar and sciatic pain, cervico-brachial neuralgia, persistent torticollis, post-traumatic and post-operative pain [L1661].Thiocolchicoside, is a synthetic sulfur derivative of colchicoside, a naturally occurring glucoside contained in the Colchicum autumnale plant. Thiocolchicoside has a selective and potent afﬁnity for g-aminobutyric acid A (GABA-A) receptors and acts on muscular contractures by activating the GABA inhibitory pathways thereby behaving as a potent muscle relaxant [L1661].  Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the human cortex [A18424].  GABAergic neurons are involved in myorelaxation, anxiolytic treatment, sedation, and anesthetics. GABA can also modulate heart rate and blood pressure.    It also has an affinity for the inhibitory glycine receptors (i.e., have glycomimetic and GABA mimetic activity), therefore acts as a muscle relaxant. Glycine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter and acts as an allosteric regulator of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors. It is involved in the processing of motor and sensory data, thereby regulating movement, vision, and audition. Inhibitory neurotransmitter in spinal cord, allosteric regulator of NMDA receptors [L1663, A32122].    In one study, thiocolchicoside inhibited the function of recombinant human strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors composed of the alpha1 subunit with a potency (median inhibitory concentration of 47 microM) lower than that apparent with recombinant GABA(A) receptors. The drug also inhibited the function of human nicotinic acetylcholine receptors made of the alpha4 and beta2 subunits, however, this effect was partial and moreover only apparent at high concentrations. Thiocolchicoside demonstrated no effect on the function of 5-HT(3A) serotonin receptors [A18424]."
1485,"Used as preservative in some cosmetics, topical pharmaceuticals, and biological drug products, which includes vaccines [L1671, L1672, L1673].Thiomersal (INN), commonly known in the U.S. as thimerosal, is an organomercury compound. This compound is a well-established and widely used antiseptic and antifungal agent.     Developed in 1927, thimerosal has been and is still being used as a preservative in some cosmetics, topical pharmaceuticals, and biological drug products, which includes vaccines. There has been significant concern regarding its safety and toxicity in the last several decades. Although thimerosal is banned in several countries, it continues to be included as a preservative in some vaccines in the United States and many vaccines in the developing world [L1685].Thimerosal is an organomercurial compound and derivative of thiosalicyclic acid with antibacterial and antifungal properties [L1672]. Thimerosal, which consists of approximately 50% mercury by weight, has been one of the most widely used preservatives in vaccines. It is metabolized/degraded to ethylmercury and thiosalicylate. Ethylmercury is an organomercurial that must be carefully distinguished from methylmercury, a closely related substance that has been the focus of many studies. Methylmercury is the type of mercury found in various species of fish [L1688].    Experimental data demonstrates that the toxicokinetics of thimerosal (ethylmercury) is vastly different from that of methyl-mercury. Thus, methyl-mercury is not a suitable reference for assessing the risk from exposure to thimerosal-derived mercury [L1692].    Prior to the recent initiative to reduce or eliminate thimerosal from childhood vaccines, the maximum cumulative exposure to mercury via routine childhood vaccinations during the first 6 months of life was 187.5 micrograms. In the most recently formulated vaccines, the maximum cumulative exposure during the first 6 months of life should now be less than 3 micrograms of mercury. Currently, thimerosal may still be used in the early stages of manufacturing of certain childhood vaccines, however, only a trace remains after a chemical purification process. Note that the dose above is indicated for children 1-6 months of age is applicable only in the United States, and other countries may have varying indications [L1687].Although its mechanism of action is not fully understood, thimerosal inhibits sulfhydryl-containing active site of various enzymes and binds to sulfhydryl compounds, including glutathione, cysteine, and sulfhydryl groups of proteins. In addition, thimerosal activates the InsP3 calcium channel on the endoplasmic reticular membrane, thereby triggering the release of intracellular calcium resulting in a calcium-induced calcium-influx of extracellular calcium. Therefore, thimerosal may induce or inhibit various cellular functions that are dependent on the signaling of calcium [L1674].    Ethylmercury is metabolized to inorganic mercury more rapidly than methylmercury. This difference in metabolism may account for kidney pathology that can result from toxic quantities. Also, whereas the increase in oxidative stress and induction of apoptosis observed in vitro with large doses (405 μg/L to 101 mg/L) of thimerosal may explain its damaging neurological effects. The effects of low-dose ethylmercury are not completely understood to date. It is known, however, that the shorter half-life of ethylmercury (the metabolite of thimerosal) allows for very limited opportunities of ethylmercury derived from thimerosal in vaccines [L1674].    Ethylmercury is a lipophilic cation that is capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier. The octanol/water partition coefficients of methyl and ethylmercury are 1.4 to 1.8, at intracellular pH and [Cl−], therefore, both organomercury compounds will primarily exist as intracellular lipophilic cations. It has been demonstrated that lipophilic cations accumulate inside mitochondria, in a Nernstian fashion, driven by the steady state membrane potential. As the typical mitochondrial membrane potential of astrocytes and neurons is between 140–170 mV, one would expect the concentration of these organomercury compounds within mitochondria to be approximately 1000 times greater than the cytosolic concentration [L1689].

1488,Aclarubicin (INN) or aclacinomycin A[1] is an anthracycline drug[2] that is used in the treatment of cancer. Soil bacteria Streptomyces galilaeus can produce aclarubicin. It can induce histone eviction from chromatin upon intercalation.
1489,"No approved therapeutic indications. Dehydrocholic acid is a synthetic bile acid that was prepared from the oxidation of cholic acid with chromic acid [A33022]. It has been used for stimulation of biliary lipid secretion. The use of dehydrocholic acid in over-the-counter products has been discontinued by Health Canada.Following infusion of dehydrocholic acid (DHCA) in rats, the secretions of all the endogenous biliary bile acids were decreased within 30-60 minutes of infusion [A33023, A33025]. Phospholipid secretion as well as cholesterol levels were also declined. The bile flow was increased after administration of dehydrocholic acid [A33022]. It is proposed that dehydrocholic acid induces choleresis, which is associated with biliary lipid secretion and reduced secretion of endogenous and/or exogenous biliary components [A33023]. Dehydrocholic acid may decrease bile phospholipid secretion due to a lack of micelle formation by dehydrocholic acid-produced bile [A33024]. A study suggests that due to enhanced permeability of tight junctions in the canalicular membranes, dehydrocholic acid facilitates direct exchange between bile and plasma [A33024]. "
1490,"For use in the treatment of patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck failing standard therapies and who are unsuitable for radiotherapy, surgery, or systemic chemotherapy [FDA Label].Temoporfin is a photosensitizing agent used in the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck [FDA Label]. It was first authorized for market by the European Medicines Agency in October 2001. It is currently available under the brand name Foscan.Temoporfin is a photosensitizing agent [FDA Label]. It enters cancer cells and is activated via light to produce reactive species which destroy the cell.Temoporfin is excited from ground state to the first excited singlet state by the application of 652 nm light [L1128, A31547]. It is then thought to undergo intersystem crossing to an excited triplet state which is longer lived and able to interact with surrounding molecules [A31547]. It is then thought to produce cytotoxic species by either a Type I or Type II reaction typical of agents used in photodynamic therapy. Type I involves either hydrogen abstraction of electron transfer from the excited photosensitizer to a substrate molecule to produce free radicals or radical ions. Type II reactions involve a similar reaction with oxygen as the substrate to produce reactive oxygen species. These reactive products cause oxidative damage to the cancer cell resulting in cell death.    There is evidence that photodynamic therapy with Temoporfin activates macrophages and increases phagocytosis [A31548]. These activated macrophages also produce more tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and nitric oxide (NO). It is thought that this increase in macrophage activity contributes to the efficacy of therapy through phagocytosis of cancer cells and increased cell death signalling though TNF-α. The increase in NO production likely contributes to oxidative damage through reactive nitrogen species."

1493,"Selumetinib is indicated for the treatment of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) in patients two years and older who have symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas (PN).[A193611,L12852,L12969,L49986]Activation of the Raf-MEK-ERK signalling pathway is known to be implemented in several types of malignancies; thus, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors such as selumetinib are important tools that can target the problematic overactivity of this pathway.[A193611]  Results from clinical trials investigating earlier developed MEK inhibitors were underwhelming.[A193611] However, selumetinib demonstrated impressive efficacy and tolerability in Phase I trials, leading to its continued investigation for the treatment of various types of tumours in Phase II trials.[A193611]    Currently, the novel MEK 1 / 2 inhibitor, selumetinib, is approved solely for the treatment of Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) in a limited age group. NF-1 is considered rare, with an estimated incidence of 1/3000 individuals.[A193608] It is a genetic, autosomal dominant condition resulting from mutations of the NF1 gene, which can lead to various complications, including the development of multiple tumours in the nervous system.[A193533,A193608] Some patients with this disorder develop plexiform neurofibromas (PN); however, this is considered relatively uncommon compared to other variants of NF-1.[A193608] Luckily, the use of selumetinib in patients with NF-1 have shown efficacy in shrinking associated tumours and is linked to other positive clinical outcomes.[A193533] Selumetinib was approved by the FDA on April 10, 2020.[L49991] It was later approved by Health Canada on August 23, 2022.[L49986]Selumetinib is a non-ATP-competitive mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 and 2 (MEK1 and MEK2) inhibitor.[A193611] By selectively targeting MEK1 and MEK2, selumetinib is able to inhibit oncogenic downstream effects of the Raf-MEK-ERK signaling pathway, which is often overactive in certain types of cancer.[A193611] Indeed, a study investigating the effects of selumetinib in children with NF-1 found that treatment with the anti-neoplastic resulted in reduced tumor size.[A193533] Decreases in tumor-associated pain and improvements in overall function were also subjectively reported.[A193533]    Selumetinib has minimal off-target activity, contributing to its impressive safety profile.[A193638]The Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling cascade is known to be activated in several types of cancer, and regulates the transcription of proteins involved in apoptosis.[A193614,A193632] In addition, studies have shown that mutations of the Raf component of the pathway can contribute to chemotherapy drug resistance.[A193614,A193617]     Ras as well as several kinases and phosphatases are responsible for regulating the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway.[A193614] Often in cancers, Ras (a G-protein coupled receptor) is deregulated, allowing downstream signalling to proceed unchecked.[A193614] Through several complex steps, Raf phosphorylates and activates MEK, which then phosphorylates and activates ERK.[A193602,A193614] ERK is then able to exert its effects on several downstream targets.[A193602,A193614]     As such, therapies inhibiting upstream components of this pathway have become attractive targets for cancer treatment.[A193602] Selumetinib exerts its effects by selectively inhibiting MEK1 and MEK2 which can effectively blunt the pleiotropic effects of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK cascade.[A193533,A193620] By inhibiting this oncogenic pathway, selumetinib reduces cell proliferation, and promotes pro-apoptotic signal transduction.[A193602,A193602,A193632]"

It was granted accelerated approval by the FDA in May 2017 [A192807] for the treatment of selected patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma.[L12621] In September 2018, durvalumab was approved by the EMA for the treatment of adult patients with  locally advanced, unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), only if PD-L1 is expressed in ≥ 1% of tumour cells and there was no observable disease progression following platinum-based chemoradiation therapy.[A192789,L12627] On March 27, 2020, durvalumab was approved by the FDA for as first-line treatment of patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC).[L12624]Durvalumab is an anticancer antibody that works to promote the antitumour responses mediated by immune cells. By blocking the action of PD-L1, durvalumab exerts its anticancer effects by increasing T-cell activation, enhancing detection and ablation of tumour cells.[L12621] In _in vitro_ assays, durvalumab inhibited the activity of PD-L1 in a concentration-dependent manner.[A192807] In co-engrafted human tumor and immune cell xenograft mouse models, durvalumab was effective in decreasing tumour size. Durvalumab does not mediate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).[L12621]Because cancer cells express antigens that are recognized and taken up by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), the immune responses prime and activate cytotoxic T cells, and allow them to travel to the site of the tumour to destroy cancer cells. However, tumours often evade T cell-mediated immune responses to enhance their survival.[A192798] Inflammatory mediators, such as IFN-gamma, induce the expression of programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1), which is a type 1 transmembrane protein expressed on tumour cells and tumour-associated immune cells in the tumour microenvironment.[A192789,L12621] PD-L1 acts as an immune checkpoint to regulate immune responses. PD-L1 is a ligand to PD-1, which is a cell surface receptor expressed on activated T cells in peripheral tissues following antigen exposure.[A192789,A192801] Both PD-L1 and PD-1 are co-inhibitory molecules involved in blocking T cell-mediated immune responses. PD-L1 also interacts with CD-80, which is a receptor constitutively expressed by T cells and is upregulated early after T cell activation.[A193005]    The expression of PD-L1 is an adaptive immune response by tumour cells, resulting in the over-expression of the molecule in some cancers.[A192801] PD-L1 interacts with PD-1 and CD80, which leads to blocked cytotoxic T cell activation, T cell proliferation, and cytokine production.[L12621] By binding to PD-L1 and preventing its association with PD-1 and CD80, durvalumab activates the immune responses mediated by cytotoxic T cells that attack tumour cells.[L12621] Durvalumab displays selective and high affinity toward PD-L1 but not PD-L2, which is a regulatory ligand expressed in tumour cells to a lesser extent and involved in regulating inflammation and differentiation of T cells.[A192789]"
1496,"Kisqali (ribociclib) is a selective cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, a class of drugs that help slow the progression of cancer by inhibiting two proteins called cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6). These proteins, when over-activated, can enable cancer cells to grow and divide too quickly. Targeting CDK4/6 with enhanced precision may play a role in ensuring that cancer cells do not continue to replicate uncontrollably.Ribociclib is a selective cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, a class of drugs that help slow the progression of cancer by inhibiting two proteins called cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6).

Targeting CDK4/6 with enhanced precision may play a role in ensuring that cancer cells do not continue to replicate uncontrollably. Ribociclib was approved by the U.S. FDA in March, 2017 as Kisqali.Inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) may provide protection against oncogenic processes in specific tissue types. For example, CDK4 is not required for normal mammary tissue development based on knockout mouse studies, but it is needed for growth of Ras-induced mammary tumors, suggesting a potential therapeutic window for treatment with lower toxicity.  Ribociclib was reported to be a most selective CDK4/6 inhibitor and to have dose dependent antitumor activity in a number of preclinical models. It  inhibited growth of tumor cells by arresting the cells at the G1 checkpoint, which prevents the tumor cells from proliferating."
1497,"Rifamycin is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with travelers' diarrhea caused by noninvasive strains of E. coli. The status of the disease should not be complicated by fever or blood in the stool. To prevent drug-resistant bacteria, it is important to mention that the use of rifamycin for this indication should be only done in cases where the infection is proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria.[L4802] Travallers' diarrhea is very common problem affecting 20-60% of the travellers and it is defined as an increase in frequency of bowel movements to three or more loose stools per day during a trip abroad. This condition is rarely life threatening but in severe cases it can produce dehydration and sepsis. The most common cause of travellers' diarrhea is a pathogen and from the pathogens identified, bacteria is the most common cause followed by norovirus, rotavirus and similar viruses.[A39995]Rifamycin is the prime member of the rifamycin family which are represented by drugs that are a product of fermentation from the gram-positive bacterium Amycolatopsis mediterranei, also known as Streptomyces mediterranei. The parent compound of rifamycin was rifamycin B which was originally obtained as a main product in the presence of diethylbarburitic acid. Some small modifications where performed in this inactive compound and with the creation of rifamycin SV there was the first antibiotic used intravenously for the treatment of tuberculosis.[A39990] Rifamycin has had several direct derivative products such as rifamycin SV, rifaximin, rifampin and rifamycin CV. All of the derivatives have slight different physicochemical properties when compared to the parent structure.[A39986] Rifamycin was further developed by Cosmo Technologies Ltd and approved in November 16, 2018 by the FDA as a prescription drug after being granted the designation of Qualified Infectious Disease Product which allowed it to have a status a priority review.[L4800] This drug was also sent for review to the EMA in 2015 by Dr. Falk Pharma Gmbh and it was granted a waiver for the tested conditions.[L4801]Rifamycin is known to be effective against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens and mycobacteria. It is very effective against E. coli reporting a MIC90 of 64-128 mcg/ml without showing cross-resistance with other antimicrobial agents.[A39996] The specific indication of rifamycin is extremely important as ther were previous reports that indicated a high risk factor in the generation of resistant E. coli strains in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.[L4804] In clinical trials, rifamycin was tested in a randomized clinical trial of travellers' coming from Mexico and Guatemala. In this trial, rifamycin was proven to significantly reduce the symptoms of travellers' diarrhea.[L4802]Rifamycins, as well as all the other members of this group, present an antibacterial mechanism of action related to the inhibition of RNA synthesis. This mechanism of action is done by the strong binding to the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase of prokaryotes. The inhibition of the RNA synthesis is thought to be related with the initiation phase of the process and to involve stacking interactions between the naphthalene ring and the aromatic moiety in the polymerase. As well, it has been suggested that the presence of zinc atoms in the polymerase allows for the binding of phenolic -OH groups of the naphthalene ring.[T366] In eukaryotic cells, the binding is significantly reduced making them at least 100 to 10,000 times less sensitive to the action of rifamycins. The members of the rifamycin family present the same mechanism of action and the structural modifications are usually related to pharmacokinetic properties as well as to the interaction with eukaryotic cells.[A40003]"
1498,"Brodalumab has been approved for the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris, psoriatic arthritis, pustular psoriasis and psoriatic erythroderma. Brodalumab has been used in trials studying the treatment of Asthma, Psoriasis, Crohn's Disease, Psoriatic Arthritis, and Rheumatoid Arthritis. Brodalumab was FDA approved in February, 2017 as Siliq for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.Increase in the level of IL-17 due to blocking of its receptors. Brodalumab binds with high affinity to interleukin (IL)-17 receptor A, thereby inhibiting several pro-inflammatory cytokines from the IL-17 family."
1499,"In the US and Europe, baricitinib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more TNF blockers.[L41760]    In Europe, baricitinib is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy.[L41770]    In the US, baricitinib is also indicated for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in hospitalized adults requiring supplemental oxygen, non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.[L41760] Recently, it is also approved as the treatment for severe alopecia areata in adults.[L42070]Baricitinib is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. JAKs are tyrosine protein kinases that play an important role in pro-inflammatory signaling pathways. Overactive JAKs have been implicated in autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis. By inhibiting the actions of JAK1 and JAK2, baricitinib attenuates JAK-mediated inflammation and immune responses.[L41760]    Baricitinib was first approved by the European Commission (EC) in February 2017 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults [A248395] and was later approved by the FDA in 2018.[A248400] The EC later approved baricitinib for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, making it the first JAK inhibitor used for this indication in Europe.[A248405] While baricitinib was granted emergency use as a treatment for COVID-19 in combination with [remdesivir] under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in November 2020,[L22619] the FDA fully approved the use of baricitinib for the treatment of COVID-19 in May 2022.[L41760]Baricitinib is a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) used to ameliorate symptoms and slow down the progression of rheumatoid arthritis. In animal models of inflammatory arthritis, baricitinib was shown to have significant anti-inflammatory effects but also led to the preservation of cartilage and bone, with no detectable suppression of humoral immunity or adverse hematologic effects.[A31382] Baricitinib decreased the levels of immunoglobulins and serum C-reactive protein in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.[L41760]As members of the tyrosine kinase family, Janus kinases (JAKs) are intracellular enzymes that modulate signals from cytokines and growth factor receptors involved in hematopoiesis, inflammation, and immune cell function. Upon binding of extracellular cytokines and growth factors, JAKs phosphorylate and activate Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs). STATs modulate intracellular activity, including gene transcription of inflammatory mediators that promote an autoimmune response,[A31381,A31387,A248390,L41760] such as IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, IL-15, IL-23, IFN-γ, GM-CSF, and interferons.[A31381,A31387] The JAK-STAT pathway has been implicated in the pathophysiology of rheumatoid arthritis, as it is associated with an overproduction of inflammatory mediators.[A31387]    There are four JAK proteins: JAK 1, JAK 2, JAK 3 and TYK2. JAKs form homodimers or heterodimers and pair differently in different cell receptors to transmit cytokine signaling.[A248390,L41760] Baricitinib is a selective and reversible inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2 with less affinity for JAK3 and TYK2; however, the relevance of inhibition of specific JAK enzymes to therapeutic effectiveness is not currently known.[L41760]  Baricitinib inhibits the activity of JAK proteins and modulates the signaling pathway of various interleukins, interferons, and growth factors. It was also shown to decrease the proliferation of JAK1/JAK2 expression in mutated cells and induce cell apoptosis.[A248390]"
1500,"Esketamine is indicated for the treatment of treatment-resistant depression in adults.[L12999] It is also indicated for the treatment of depressive symptoms in adults with major depressive disorder experiencing acute suicidal ideation or behaviour.[L12999]Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a significant cause of disability worldwide and the most common illness preceding suicide.[L5596,A175462] On March 5, 2019, the nasal spray drug, esketamine, also known as Spravato (by Janssen Pharmaceuticals), was approved by the FDA for treatment-resistant major depression. Esketamine is the s-enantiomer of [Ketamine]. Ketamine is a mixture of two enantiomers (mirror image molecules). This is the first time that the FDA has approved esketamine for any use. The FDA approved ketamine (Ketalar) in 1970.[L5593] Esketamine may prove to be a promising treatment for patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder who have not experienced an improvement in symptoms despite treatment with various medications and therapies. The intranasal route of administration for this drug allows for easy administration and a fast onset of action, which sets it apart from many other antidepressant agents that may take several weeks to take effect.General effects Esketamine is considered a central nervous system (CNS) depressant agent. It may cause sedation, dizziness, and lethargy, among other symptoms.[L12999] This drug has dissociative and antidepressant properties.[L12999] Acutely, esketamine may impair attention, judgment, thinking, reaction speed, and motor skills. Two placebo-controlled studies were performed to evaluate the effects of ketamine on the ability to drive. The effects of esketamine 84 mg were comparable to placebo at 6 hours and 18 hours post-ingestion.[L12999] Effects on cardiac electrophysiology The effect of esketamine (84 mg nasal spray and 0.8 mg/kg esketamine intravenously infused over 40 minutes) on the QTc interval was studied in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-, and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg), 4-period, crossover study in 60 healthy volunteers. A marked increase in heart rate (higher than 10 bpm) was measured in subjects receiving intranasal and intravenous esketamine. Summative evidence from both nonclinical and clinical data suggests a lack of clinically relevant QTc prolongation at the normal therapeutic dose of esketamine.[L12999] Effects on blood pressure Eskestamine causes increases in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure at all therapeutic doses. Peak blood pressure elevation after esketamine administration occurs about 40 minutes after administration and lasts approximately 4 hours.[L12999] Cognitive effects In a study of healthy volunteers, one dose of this agent caused decline in cognitive performance 40 minutes after administration. Compared to subjects ingesting a placebo, esketamine-treated subjects required a higher level of effort to complete assigned cognitive tests at 40 minutes after administration. Cognitive performance and mental effort were found to be similar between esketamine and placebo at 2 hours after administration.[L12999] Reports of long-term memory or cognitive impairment have been made following repeated ketamine misuse or abuse. No adverse effects of esketamine nasal spray on cognitive function were seen in a one-year open-label safety study. The long-term cognitive effects of esketamine have not been studied for more than a 1 year period, therefore, the risk of cognitive decline with long-term use is not yet confirmed.[L12999]Esketamine, the S-enantiomer of racemic ketamine, is a non-selective, non-competitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, an ionotropic glutamate receptor. The exact mechanism by which esketamine acts as an antidepressant is unknown. The primary circulating metabolite of esketamine (noresketamine) shows activity at the same receptor with a weaker affinity.[L12999]"
1501,"Deflazacort is indicated for the treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) in patients 2 years of age and older.[FDA label]Deflazacort, also known as Emflaza, is a corticosteroid prodrug used as an agent to manage Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). It is marketed by Marathon Pharmaceuticals and was approved in February 2017 by the FDA.[L6694,FDA label]    Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is an inherited disorder resulting from mutations of the dystrophin gene, which is important for muscle function. This disease can cause serious muscle weakness and progressive breathing and cardiovascular disability, severely impacting patient quality of life and survival.[A179446,A179449,L6697] This disease usually manifests by muscle weakness in early childhood followed by loss of the ability to walk (ambulation) as early as age 7.[A179449]    Deflazacort delays the onset of muscle related complications resulting from DMD[A179455], prolonging the lives of children diagnosed with this disease and exerting less harmful effects on the bone health and weight than other steroid medications.[A179452,A25340]Deflazacort exerts anti-inflammatory activity in DMD, likely improving various symptoms, including muscle weakness and cardiorespiratory symptoms in addition to delaying their onset.[A179455] This allows for an increased quality of life and prevents the necessity for surgical procedures, such as those for scoliosis, which is associated with DMD. Studies showed significant preservation of muscle mass in patients generally treated with 0.9 mg/kg/day of deflazacort compared to a control group. The following findings are based on clinical studies using deflazacort on a long term basis[A179455,A179458]:    **Effects on muscle strength**     At age 16, individuals treated with long-term deflazacort had 63 ± 4% score in muscle strength compared to a mean muscle strength score of 31 ± 3% for control patients[A179455]. Significant improvements in climbing stairs and rising from a supine position were also seen in patients taking deflazacort.[A179455]     **Effects on ambulation**    Ambulation was significantly higher by 12 years of age and 18 years of age in patients taking deflazacort when compared with the control group. The control group showed a mean loss of ambulation of 2 years sooner than with deflazacort treatment.[A179458]      **Effects on cardiac function**    Mean left ventricular ejection fraction (a measure of cardiac function) was higher in patients treated with deflazacort over the long term. Preservation of cardiac function was demonstrated by a mean difference in ejection fraction of about 7%, favoring study groups taking deflazacort over control groups.[A179458]    **Effects on spinal alignment**    Children treated with deflazacort also significantly lowered the rate and severity of scoliosis and eliminated the need for scoliosis surgery after long-term treatment.[A179455,A179458]Deflazacort is a corticosteroid prodrug with an active metabolite, 21-deflazacort, which binds to the glucocorticoid receptor to exert anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects on the body.[A18725,A179461,A179464] The exact mechanism by which deflazacort exerts its therapeutic effects in patients with DMD is unknown but likely occurs via its anti-inflammatory activities.[FDA label] "
1502,"Duvelisib is indicated for the treatment of relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) in adult patients who have trialed at least two prior therapies.[L40144]Duvelisib, also known as IPI-145 and INK-1197, is a small-molecule inhibitor of phosphoinositide-3 kinases that was designed initially to prove that simultaneous inhibition of the isoforms delta and gamma can produce a broad adaptative and innate immune cell inhibitory activity. All the work around duvelisib showed that this agent is a potent inhibitor of both forms.[A39025] Duvelisib was developed by Verastem, Inc and FDA approved on September 24, 2018.[L4585]Preclinical data showed that duvelisib presents cytotoxic actions at micromolar doses and antagonizes the activation of downstream signaling even in the presence of the mutation BTK C481S, which allows for the treatment of patients resistant to ibrutinib.[A39032]    In clinical trials, duvelisib was compared to ofatumumab in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic leukemia. This trials reported a median progression-free survival of 16.4 months and an overall response rate of 78% which were almost 2-fold what it was reported for ofatumumab.[L4585]    In clinical trials of follicular lymphoma, duvelisib presented and overall response rate of 42% from which almost all the patients observed a partial response. Of the responding patients, 43% maintained the response for at least 6 months and 17% for at least 12 months.[L4585]Duvelisib acts as a strong reversible inhibitor of the isoform gamma and delta of the phosphoinositide3-kinase (PI3K).[A39028]  PI3K plays a very important role in innate and adaptative immunity and the inhibition of the form delta and gamma has been very important for the suppression of immunity.[A39031]    The activity of PI3K gamma and delta is restricted to hematopoietic cells and it is necessary for normal B cell development. In lymphomas, the activation of PI3K is enlarged to promote unlimited growth and survival. Hence, inhibition of PI3K can provide an inhibition of the signaling from BCR, inhibition of a cytokine signaling from the microenvironment and enhancement of anti-tumor immunity.[A39032] The specific mechanism of this PI3K inhibitors are further described as follows:    -BCR activates signaling pathways after antigen engagement and it is also critical for the physiologic life of the lymphocytes and neoplastic lymphomas. In CLL, BCR reacts to auto- and exo-antigens to promote clonal expansion. This sustained presence of BCR activates delta PI3K producing a pro-survival pathway of the neoplastic cells which already present a higher activity of PI3K. Thus, the blockade of PI3K will limit the activity of BCR and the driven physiology of the lymphoma.[A39032]    -The inhibition of PI3K can also inhibit paracrine and autocrine pro-survival signals mediated by adhesion molecules, chemokines and soluble factors. This activity is attained due to the fact that several downstream signals convey on PI3K.[A39034]    -It has been reported that inactivation of PI3K produces a significant resistance to tumorigenesis. This data suggests that inhibition of PI3K can facilitate recognition and elimination of tumor cells.[A39032]    In summary, duvelisib inhibits the isoform delta of PI3K which is necessary for cell proliferation and survival and the isoform gamma which is critical for cytokine signaling and the pro-inflammatory response.[A39034]"
1503,"Dacomitinib is indicated as the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R substitution mutations as verified by an FDA-approved test.[L4812]    Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death and NSCLC accounts for 85% of lung cancer cases. From the cases of NSCLC, approximately 75% of the patients present a late diagnosis with metastatic and advanced disease which produces a survival rate of 5%. The presence of a mutation in EGFR accounts for more than the 60% of the NSCLC cases and the overexpression of EGFR is associated with frequent lymph node metastasis and poor chemosensitivity.[A40018, A19201]Dacomitinib, designed as (2E)-N-16-4-(piperidin-1-yl) but-2-enamide, is an oral highly selective quinazalone part of the second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors which are characterized by the irreversible binding at the ATP domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor family kinase domains.[A40009]    Dacomitinib was developed by Pfizer Inc and approved by the FDA on September 27, 2018.[L4810] Some evidence in the literature suggests the therapeutic potential of dacomitinib in the epithelial ovarian cancer model[A39624], although further investigations are needed.Preclinical data suggested that dacomitinib increases the inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor kinase domain as well as the activity in cell lines harboring resistance mutations such as T790M. This activity further produced a significant reduction of EGFR phosphorylation and cell viability. In these studies, non-small cell lymphoma cancer cell lines with L858R/T790M mutations where used and an IC50 of about 280 nmol/L was observed.[A40010]    In clinical trials with patients with advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma who progressed after chemotherapy, there was an objective response rate of 5% with a progression-free survival of 2.8 months and an overall survival of 9.5 months. As well, phase I/II studies showed positive dacomitinib activity despite prior failure with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.[A40009]    Phase III clinical trials (ARCHER 1050), done in patients suffering from advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma with EGFR-activating mutations, reported a significant improvement in progression-free survival when compared with gefitinib.[A40015]Dacomitinib is an irreversible small molecule inhibitor of the activity of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family (EGFR/HER1, HER2, and HER4) tyrosine kinases. It achieves irreversible inhibition via covalent bonding to the cysteine residues in the catalytic domains of the HER receptors.[A40011] The affinity of dacomitinib has been shown to have an IC50 of 6 nmol/L.[A40009]    The ErbB or epidermal growth factor (EGF) family plays a role in tumor growth, metastasis, and treatment resistance by activating downstream signal transduction pathways such as such as Ras-Raf-MAPK, PLCgamma-PKC-NFkB and PI3K/AKT through the tyrosine kinase-driven phosphorylation at the carboxy-terminus.[A39624] Around 40% of cases show amplification of EGFR gene and 50% of the cases present the _EGFRvIII_ mutation which represents a deletion that produces a continuous activation of the tyrosine kinase domain of the receptor.[A40016]"
1504,"Ocrelizumab is a CD20-directed cytolytic antibody indicated for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), including clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease, in adults. Ocrelizumab is also indicated for the treatment of primary progressive MS in adults.[L42895]Ocrelizumab is a CD20-directed cytolytic antibody indicated for the treatment of patients with primary progressive or relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS).[L42895] It is a second-generation recombinant humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that selectively targets B-cells that express the CD20 antigen.[A31739] Compared to non-humanized CD20 antibodies such as [rituximab], ocrelizumab is expected to be less immunogenic with repeated infusions, improving the benefit-to-risk profile for patients with MS.[A18875,A251745]    MS is a chronic, inflammatory, autoimmune disease of the central nervous system that leads to neurological disabilities and a significantly reduced quality of life.[L1199] Most patients with MS experience episodes of relapses with worsening function, followed by recovery periods or remissions. Primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) accounts for 10-15% of the overall population of patients with MS, and leads to the gradual worsening of neurologic disability from symptom onset, often without early relapses or remissions [A31741].    Developed by Genentech/Roche, ocrelizumab was approved by the FDA in March 2017 under the market name Ocrevus for intravenous injection. It was later approved by Health Canada in August 2017, making the drug the first available treatment for PPMS in both the US and Canada. In clinical trials of patients with relapsing forms of MS, treatment with ocrelizumab resulted in reduced relapse rates and reduced worsening of disability compared to [interferon beta-1a].[L1199] In phase 3 clinical trials of patients with PPMS, treatment with ocrelizumab led to lower clinical and MRI progression rates compared to placebo.[A31741]Since ocrelizumab interferes with the CD20 assay, CD19+B-cells are used to assess B-cell counts after treatment. Fourteen days following infusion, a reduction in CD19+B-cell counts was observed. In clinical studies, B-cell counts rose above the lower limit of normal (LLN) or baseline counts between infusions of ocrelizumab at least once in 0.3% to 4.1% of patients. In a clinical study involving 51 patients, the time for B-cell counts to return to baseline or LLN ranged from 27 to 125 weeks, with a median time of 72 weeks after the last infusion. Within 2.5 years after the last infusion, B-cell counts returned to either baseline or LNN in 90% of patients treated with ocrelizumab.[L42895]     Since ocrelizumab is a recombinant humanized antibody, it is expected to be less immunogenic than [rituximab], a chimeric antibody. Compared to the ocrelizumab pivotal trial, a rituximab phase II trial had a higher proportion of anti-drug antibodies, suggesting greater immunogenicity. However, caution should be exercised since these studies used different assay methods, and the association between anti-drug antibody development and infusion reactions has not been fully elucidated.[A251735] The use of ocrelizumab can cause infusion reactions, and lead to a higher risk of respiratory tract infections and viral infections. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and immune-mediated colitis have been reported in patients treated with ocrelizumab. Also, an increased risk of malignancy may exist.[L42895]Ocrelizumab is a recombinant humanized antibody that targets CD20, a glycosylated phosphoprotein expressed on the surface of different types of B-cells. CD20 can be found on pre-B cells, naïve and memory B-cells, and it is not expressed on hematopoietic stem B-cells, pro-B cells (precursors), or differentiated plasma cells.[A31739,A31741] Therefore, by targeting CD20, ocrelizumab does not affect the concentration of IgG and IgM antibodies in blood or the cerebrospinal fluid.[A31739]     B-cells contribute to the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) through the activation of proinflammatory T-cells and the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. Also, B-cells may differentiate into plasma cells that produce autoantibodies directed against myelin, leading to the complement-mediated attack on the myelin sheath [A31739]. By targeting CD20, ocrelizumab specifically depletes B-cells. While the exact mechanism of ocrelizumab leading to B-cell depletion is unknown, there are several proposed mechanisms. It has been suggested that upon cell surface binding to CD20-expressing B-cells, ocrelizumab promotes antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-mediated cell lysis while preserving the capacity for B-cell reconstitution and preexisting humoral immunity.[A31739,A31741,A251720]"

However, the drug manufacturer, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma, withdrew the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for edaravone from the European market on May 24, 2019, in response to the request made by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) for a long-term study demonstrating the long-term efficacy and safety of edaravone.[L44002,L44012] Edaravone was also investigated in other disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease,[A19138] neuropathic pain, and ischemia-induced nerve injury.[A19139]Edaravone works to delay the disease progression of neurological disorders such as ischemic stroke and ALS by limiting the extent of neuronal damage or death.[A19140]Oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production have been implicated in various neurological disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and cerebral ischemia.[A19140,L44007,A254257] Oxidative stress caused by excess ROS damages endothelial cells in the cerebral vasculature as well as neuronal cell membranes, leading to neuronal cell death.[A19140]    Edaravone is a free radical scavenger that scavenges and suppresses the generation of hydroxyl radicals and peroxynitrite radicals.[A19140] The exact mechanism of action of edaravone in ALS has not been fully elucidated; however, edaravone is thought to mediate therapeutic effects via its antioxidant properties. Since oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathophysiology of ALS and cerebral ischemia, inhibiting lipid peroxidation, suppressing endothelial cell damage induced by lipid peroxides, and scavenging free radicals may lead to neuroprotective effects.[A19139,A19143] Edaravone has no effect on superoxide production.[A19139,A19140] It is suggested that edaravone may also possess anti-inflammatory properties, as it inhibited neutrophil activation and suppressed inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) expression in animal models. It was also shown to ameliorate ROS-induced inflammatory oxidative stress after ischemic brain reperfusion.[A19140]"
1506,"Indicated for symptomatic treatment of urinary incontinence and/or increased urinary frequency and urgency in patients with overactive bladder (OAB) [L2315].  Propiverine may also be used in patients with neurogenic bladder as a result of spinal cord injury [A32581].Propiverine is a widely used antimuscarinic drug with a mixed mode of action in the treatment of symptoms associated with overactive bladder (OAB) [A32576].    Overactive bladder (OAB) is a chronic condition of the lower urinary tract characterized by urinary urgency, increased frequency of urination, and nocturia (frequent waking during the night to urinate). OAB has a negative impact on quality of life and may lead to leakage and inconvenient urinary accidents [L2327], [L2328]. Overactive bladder syndrome affects millions of elderly individuals in the United States and shows equal prevalence in men and women. The impact of OAB on quality of life is sometimes devastating, especially to elderly patients with other medical conditions [L2328].    Propiverine hydrochloride is a bladder detrusor muscle relaxant drug with dual antimuscarinic and calcium-modulating properties for the treatment of OAB [L2317].  Propiverine hydrochloride inhibits abnormal contractions of bladder smooth muscle in vivo through not only its anticholinergic activity but also its concurrent calcium antagonistic activity [L2319].  Through the above-mentioned mechanism, propiverine is able to relieve the symptoms of overactive bladder.    In animal models, this administration of this drug leads to a dose-dependent decrease in intravesical pressure of the bladder and an increase in bladder capacity [L2315]. In patients with symptoms of OAB resulting from idiopathic detrusor muscle overactivity (IDO) or neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO), propiverine showed dose-dependent efficacy and tolerability [A32576].Propiverine demonstrates both anticholinergic and calcium-modulating properties. The efferent connection of the pelvic nerve is inhibited due to the anticholinergic action exerted by this drug, leading to relaxation of bladder smooth muscle. Propiverine blocks calcium ion influx and modulates the intracellular calcium in urinary bladder smooth muscle cells, resulting in the inhibition of muscle spasm [L2315].  The bladder contains several muscarinic receptors. Acetylcholine is the main contractile neurotransmitter in the human bladder detrusor muscle, and antimuscarinics such as propiverine exert their effects by competitively inhibiting the binding of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors on detrusor smooth muscle cells and other structures within the bladder wall [L2332]. In one study, After oral treatment with propiverine, the bladder showed the highest concentration of M-2, indicating a targeted distribution of this metabolite into the bladder. Therefore, muscarinic receptor-2 may highly contribute to the relatively selective and long-lasting occupation of bladder muscarinic receptors after oral ingestion of propiverine [L2334]."

1508,"Rucaparib is indicated for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with a deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic)- associated recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy.[L44572]    Under accelerated approval by the FDA, rucaparib is also indicated for the treatment of adult patients with a deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic)-associated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have been treated with androgen receptor-directed therapy and a taxane-based chemotherapy.[L44572]Rucaparib is an anticancer drug and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor. PARP is an enzyme that plays an essential role in DNA repair.[A18745] Rucaparib is proposed to work in several PARP-dependent and PARP-independent mechanisms of action; however, it causes a unique effect of synthetic lethality. By targeting the genetically-mutated cancer cells that lack a DNA repair mechanism, rucaparib causes cancer cell death and reduces tumour growth.[A18745,A31354]    Rucaparib was granted FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation in April 2015 [A18745] and accelerated approval in December 2016.[A249240] The drug was later approved by the European Commission in May 2018.[L42185] It is currently used to treat recurrent ovarian and prostate cancer in adults.[L42155,L42185]Rucaparib is an anticancer agent that exerts cytotoxic effects against cancer cells. It works by inhibiting poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), an enzyme that plays a role in DNA repair. Rucaparib inhibits PARP-1, PARP-2, and PARP-3. It also interacts with PARP-4, PARP-10, PARP-12, PARP-15, and PARP-16, but to a lesser extent.[A18745] In mice, rucaparib accumulated and was retained in tumours, inhibiting PARP enzymes for seven days.[A249240]    Rucaparib decreases tumour growth in tumour cell lines with deficiencies in BRCA1/2 and other DNA repair genes.[L42155] In addition to PARP inhibition, rucaparib demonstrated PARP-independent cytotoxic mechanisms in cancer cells. When co-administered with other chemotherapeutic agents, rucaparib contributed to synergistic or additive effects _in vitro_ and _in vivo_. There is evidence that rucaparib can sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy. Rucaparib can also cause vasodilation, which may increase tumour perfusion and enhance the accumulation of cytotoxic drugs in cancer cells.[A249240]PARPs play a role in DNA repair by activating DNA damage response pathways, such as base excision repair, and facilitating DNA repair. PARPs were evaluated as novel anticancer therapeutic targets after discovering that PARP-1 inhibitors reduce tumour growth in BRCA-deficient cancers.[A18745] BRCA1 and BRCA2 are tumour suppressor genes involved in various cellular processes related to cell growth and death, including DNA repair.[A249195] More specifically, BRCA1 and BRCA2 are involved in homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair. Cancer cells with a deleterious BRCA mutation are HR-deficient, resulting in unregulated and aberrant cell repair and growth.[A18745]    Rucaparib inhibits PARP1, PARP2, and PARP3.[L42155] Inhibiting PARP traps the enzyme on damaged DNA, halting the repair process and forming toxic PARP–DNA complexes. Alternatively, other DNA repair processes such as error-prone nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or alternative end-joining pathways can be initiated, leading to mutations or chromosomal change.[A31354] Further DNA damage can trigger cancer cell apoptosis and cell death.[L42155]     Typically, inhibition of PARP converts single-strand breaks in DNA to double-strand breaks at replication forks. HR DNA repair pathways repair double-strand breaks; however, HR-deficient cancer cells lack this repair mechanism. Because HR-deficient cancer cells are more vulnerable to unsalvageable DNA damage, rucaparib-induced PARP inhibition leads to synthetic lethality. In this phenomenon, two non-lethal defects (HR deficiency and PARP inhibition) combine and cause cell death.[A18745,A31354]"

1513,"The primary therapeutic use for which benserazide is currently indicated for is as a combination therapy with levadopa for the treatment of Parkinson's disease in adults > 25 years of age, with the exception of drug-induced parkinsonism [F2, L2553].    At certain doses, benserazide may also be used to treat restless legs syndrome, which is sometimes associated with Parkinson's disease [L2553, T181].    There have also been some studies that have prompted the European Medicines Agency to confer orphan designation upon benserazide  hydrochloride as a potential therapy for beta thalassaemia [F3]. Although studies are ongoing, no evidence has been formally elucidated as of yet [F3].When levodopa is used by itself as a therapy for treating Parkinson's disease, its ubiquitous metabolism into dopamine is responsible for a resultant increase in the levels of circulating dopamine in the blood and to various extracerebral tissues. This can result in a number of side effects like nausea, vomiting, or even cardiac arrhythmias that may diminish patient adherence [F2, L2553]. Levodopa/benserazide combination products are used commonly worldwide for the management of Parkinson's disease. In particular, although the specific levodopa/benserazide combination is formally approved for use in Canada and much of Europe, the FDA has approved another similar levodopa/dopa decarboxylase inhibitor combination in the form of levodopa and carbidopa.    Moreover, the European Medcines Agency has conferred an orphan designation upon benseraside since 2015 for its potential to be used as a therapy for beta thalassaemia as well [F3].When used as a therapy for treating Parkinson's disease, levadopa's specific mechanism of action revolves around its metabolism into dopamine in the body [F2, L2553]. Unfortunately, the resultant increase in the levels of circulating dopamine in the blood and to various extracerebral tissues can result in a number of side effects like nausea, vomiting, or even cardiac arrhythmias that may diminish patient adherence [F2, L2553]. A decarboxylase inhibitor like benserazide is consequently an effective compound to combine with levadopa as it is incapable of crossing the blood-brain barrier itself and therefore allows levadopa to elicit its primary action in the central nervous system, but will prevent the formation of dopamine from levadopa in extracerebral tissues - thereby acting to minimize the occurrence of extracerebral side effects [F2, L2553].The combination of levodopa and benserazide is an anti-Parkinsonian agent [F2, L2553]. Levodopa itself is the metabolic precursor of dopamine. In Parkinson's disease, dopamine is depleted to a large degree in the striatum, pallidum, and substantia nigra in the central nervous system (CNS) [F2, L2553]. The administration of levodopa to treat the disease is subsequently proposed to facilitate raises in the levels of available dopamine in these areas [F2, L2553]. The metabolism of levodopa to dopamine occurs via the enzyme dopa decarboxylase, although unfortunately, this metabolism can also occur in extracerebral tissues [F2, L2553]. As a result, the full therapeutic effect of an administered dose of levodopa may not be obtained if portions of it are catabolized outside of the CNS and various patient adherence diminishing extracerebral side effects due to the extracerebral presence of dopamine like nausea, vomiting, or even cardiac arrhythmias can also happen [F2, L2553].    Subsequently, a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor like benserazide, which blocks the extracerebral decarboxylation of levodopa, when administered in combination with levodopa has obvious and significant advantages. Such benefits include reduced gastrointestinal side effects, a more rapid and complete response at the initiation of therapy, and a simpler dosing regimen [F2, L2553].    It is important to note, however, that benserazide is hydroxylated to trihydroxybenzylhydrazine in the intestinal mucosa and the liver [F2, L2553], and that as a potent inhibitor of the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase [F2, L2553, T181], it is this trihydroxybenzylhydrazine metabolite of benserazide that mainly protects levodopa against decarboxylation to dopamine in the gut and also around the rest of the body outside of the blood-brain barrier [T181].Finally, it is also proposed that benserazide hydrochloride may be able to treat beta thalassaemia by maintaining the active expression of the gene for fetal hemoglobin so that constant production of fetal hemoglobin may replace the missing adult hemoglobin variation that is characteristic of patients with the condition, thereby decreasing the need for blood transfusion therapy [F3].

Etelcalcetide was approved (trade name Parsabiv) for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis in February, 2017.Following a single intravenous bolus administration of etelcalcetide, PTH levels decreased within 30 minutes post dose. In the single-dose study, the extent and duration of the reduction in PTH increased with increasing dose. Reduction in PTH levels correlated with plasma etelcalcetide concentrations in hemodialysis patients. The reduction in PTH resulted in reductions in calcium and attenuation of post-dialytic phosphate elevation. The effect of reducing PTH levels was maintained throughout the 6-month dosing period when etelcalcetide was administered by intravenous bolus three times a week. Etelcalcetide is a calcimimetic agent that allosterically modulates the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR).Activation of the CaSR on parathyroid chief cells decreases PTH secretion.   "
1515,"Quizartinib is indicated in combination with standard cytarabine and anthracycline induction and cytarabine consolidation, and as maintenance monotherapy following consolidation chemotherapy, for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that is FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD)-positive as detected by an FDA-approved test.[L47426] Quizartinib is an oral and potent fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitor and it is the first drug developed specifically targeting FLT3, as other agents with FLT3 inhibition activities were investigated with other targets in mind.[A260641] Additionally, quizartinib also demonstrates inhibitory activity toward FLT3 with internal tandem duplication (ITD), although with a 10-fold lower affinity compared to wild-type FLT3.[L47426] FLT3-ITD mutation is present in 75% of FLT3-mutated AML, leading to constitutively active FLT3 and thus poorer overall survival and higher risk of relapse.[A260646] Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated quizartinib's efficacy in relapsed/refractory FLT3-ITD mutant AML.[A260651] Therefore, quizartinib is proven to be a beneficial addition to the current AML treatment regimen, although serious side effects such as QT prolongation necessitates further research to optimize quizartinib's addition to AML standard of care.[A260641]    Quizartinib was approved by the FDA in July 2023 and developed under the brand name VANFLYTA by Daiichi Sankyo.[L47436] The FDA approval was based on positive results from the QuANTUM-First trial for FLT3-ITD positive AML, followed by a maintenance monotherapy resulted in a 22% reduction in the risk of death.[L47436]Quizartinib showed antitumor activity in a mouse model of FLT3-ITD-dependent leukemia. In vitro, studies have shown that quizartinib is a predominant inhibitor of the slow delayed rectifier potassium current, IKs.[L47426]     In AML patients receiving quizartinib at a dose of 90 mg/day for females and 135 mg/day for males on a 28-day schedule, the median levels of phospho-FLT3 (pFLT3) and total FLT3 (tFLT3) decreased from 3312 RLU or 5639 RLU respectively at day 1 to 1235 RLU and 142 RLU respectively at day 8. Additionally, pFLT3 levels are statistically significantly higher (p < 0.0001, Mann Whitney test) for the ITD+ subjects on day 1; however, pFLT3 levels was reduced to a similar level in patients with or without the ITD mutation.[L47431]    The exposure-response analysis predicted a concentration-dependent QTcF interval median prolongation of 18 and 24 ms [upper bound of 2-sided 90% confidence interval (CI): 21 and 27 ms] at the median steady-state Cmax of quizartinib at the 26.5 mg and 53 mg dose level during maintenance therapy.[L47426]  Quizartinib is a small molecule inhibitor of the receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3. Quizartinib and its major active metabolite AC886 bind to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding domain of FLT3 with comparable affinity, and both had 10-fold lower affinity towards FLT3-ITD mutation compared to FLT3 in a binding assay. Quizartinib and AC886 inhibited FLT3 kinase activity, preventing autophosphorylation of the receptor, thereby inhibiting downstream FLT3 receptor signaling and blocking FLT3-ITD-dependent cell proliferation.[L47426] "

One study found that tiapride shows over three times as much affinity for limbic areas than striatal areas as opposed to the near equal selectivity for limbic and striatal regions shown by haloperidol.  Another study in rats found tiapride's affinity for the septum, a limbic region, to be over thirty times as high as for the striatum.  Efficacy at the D2 receptor is moderate, with 80 percent of receptors occupied even in the presence of excess tiapride concentrations.Tiapride is a selective dopamine D2 and D3 receptor antagonist, offering an advantage over other neuroleptic drugs, such as haloperidol and risperidone, which bind a range of targets including four of the five known dopamine receptor subtypes (D1-4), serotonin (5-HT2A, 2C), α1- and α2-adrenergic, and histamine H1 receptors. Compared to these drugs, tiapride has a relatively moderate affinity for its target receptors, displacing 50 percent of 3H-raclopride binding at a concentration of 320 nM at D2 receptors and a concentration of 180 nM at D3 receptors."

1520,"Indicated for the management of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, also known as chronic obstructive lung disease) and asthma.Levosalbutamol, or levalbuterol, is a short-acting β2 adrenergic receptor agonist used in the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).   [Salbutamol] has been marketed as a racemic mixture, although beta2-agonist activity resides almost exclusively in the (R)-enantiomer. The enantioselective disposition of salbutamol and the possibility that (S)-salbutamol has adverse effects have led to the development of an enantiomerically pure (R)-salbutamol formulation known as levosalbutamol (levalbuterol).It acts by relaxing smooth muscle in the bronchial tubes to increase air flow and relieve acute shortness of breath.β2 adrenergic receptors on airway smooth muscle are Gs coupled and their activation by levosalbutamol leads to activation of adenylate cyclase and to an increase in the intracellular concentration of 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP activates protein kinase A which itself inhibits the phosphorylation of myosin produces lower intracellular ionic calcium concentrations, inducing muscle relaxation. Increased cyclic AMP concentrations are also associated with the inhibition of the release of mediators from mast cells in the airways, potentially contributing to its benefit in asthma attacks."
1521,"Used in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, oesophygeal cancer, and head and neck cancers [A20300].Nedaplatin is a second generation platinum analog [A20300]. It is less nephrotoxic than [DB00515] but has proven equally effective. It was approved for use in Japan in 1995.Nedaplatin damages DNA and induces cell death in cancer cells [A20304]. It also functions as a radiosensitizer, increasing the susceptibility of the affected cells to radiation therapy [A20303].As a platinum analog, nedaplatin likely works similarly to [DB00515] on which the following mechanistic description is based. Once it has entered the cell it is hydrolyzed to its active form which complexes with water molecules [A20304]. This form binds to to nucleophiles in the cytoplasm such as glutathione and other cyteine rich proteins resulting in an overall increase in oxidative stress as the cell loses antioxidant proteins. It also binds to purine nucleotides in the DNA. The active form allows for two binding interactions to form cross-links between these nucleotides. High mobility group proteins-1 and -2 induce apoptosis in response to guanine cross-links and their binding serves to shield the cross-linked DNA from repair mechanisms. The mismatch repair (MMR) protein complex also recognizes the distortion caused by platinum complexes and attempts to repair the DNA. This results in single strand breaks when the MMR complex attempts to remove the platinum cross-link. The MMR complex induces apoptosis after the repair attempt has failed. The single strand break in DNA makes it easier to form lethal double strand breaks with radiation treatment thus creating the radiosensitizing effect of nedaplatin [A20303]."
1522,"In dermatology, topical clobestasone butyrate helps to reduce the itchiness and erythema associated with eczema and dermatitis.  In ophthalmology, clobetasone butyrate 0.1% eye drops have been shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of dry eyes in Sjögren's Syndrome.Clobetasone is a corticosteroid that is often employed topically as a treatment for a variety of conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, various forms of dermatitis, and also for certain ophthalmologic conditions. Topical clobetasone butyrate has shown minimal suppression of the Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.Topical corticosteroid like clobetasone are synthetic derivatives of cortisone which produce anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, immunosuppressive and vasoconstrictor effects when applied to the skin.Topically applied clobeyasone are thought to bind with cytoplasmic receptors in the dermal and intradermal cells and to induce inhibitory proteins, thus leading to decreased activity of prostaglandins, kinins, histamine, liposomal enzymes and other endogenous mediators of inflammation. Topical corticosteroids inhibit the migration of macrophages and leukocytes into areas of inflamed skin by reversing vascular dilation and permeability, resulting in decreased erythema, edema and pruritus."
1523,"For use in treatment of metastatic T790M mutation positive non-small cell lung cancer [A19196].Olmutinib is an orally active epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor used in the treatment of T790M mutation positive non-small cell lung cancer. It is available under the brand name Olita made by Hanmi Pharmaceuticals [A19196]. Olmutinib was developed by Hanmi Pharmaceuticals and Boehringer Ingelheim. Olmutinib recieved breakthrough therapy designation in the United States in December 2015 and was approved for use in Korea in May 2016.Olmutinib selectively and irreversibly binds and inhibits epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) with the T790M activating mutation. EGFRs are frequently over-expressed in lung cancer and contribute to activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase and mitogen activated protein kinase pathways which both promote cell survival and proliferation [A19200] [A19202]. By inhibiting EGFR activation, olmutinib attenuates the activation of these tumor promoting pathways. Olmutinib covalently binds a cysteine residue near the kinase domain of mutant EGFRs to prevent phosphorylation of the receptor [A19204]. This inhibits receptor signalling as phosphorylation is necessary for recruitment of signalling cascade proteins."

The inhibition of the enzyme occurs through the reversible block of cyclooxygenase enzyme. Therefore, it prevents the production of inflammatory mediators (and pain) as prostacyclins and prostaglandins.  Aclofenac has the ability to inhibit the biosynthesis  of prostaglandins  which may be an  important  factor in  the action of these drugs, but  in addition,   the  effect  of  these  agents  in  displacing  endogenous anti-inflammatory substances from plasma protein  binding sites is thought  to  be an equally important effect in their mechanism of action"

The use of bismuth substrate as an active ingredient in over-the-counter antacids is approved by the FDA.Bismuth subnitrate acts as an antacid that exert protective effects on the gastric mucosa [A33012]. In a double-blind endoscopically controlled study, bismuth substrate was demonstrated to be effective for symptomatic relief in duodenal ulcers [A33013].

1532,Alaproclate was developed as one of the first selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants by Astra AB (now AstraZeneca) in the 1970s. Development was discontinued due to concerns over hepatotoxicity observed in animal studies. Alaproclate has also been found to act as a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist although without discriminative stimulus properties similar to phencyclidine.
1533,Bucladesine is a cyclic nucleotide derivative which mimics the action of endogenous cAMP and is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor.Bucladesine is a cell permeable cAMP analog. The compound is used in a wide variety of research applications because it mimics cAMP and can induce normal physiological responses when added to cells in experimental conditions. cAMP is only able to elicit minimal responses in these situations.The neurite outgrowth instigated by bucladesine in cell cultures has been shown to be enhanced by nardosinone.

1540,"Dihydroergocristine is used in some countries such as Brasil as a single agent for the treatment of cerebral and peripheric vascular events.[L2649] To know more about dihydroergocristine as part of the ergoloid mesylate mixture, please visit [DB01049].Dihydroergocristine is part of the ergoloid mixture products.[L2637] It is a semisynthetic ergot alkaloid and thus, it is characterized by a structural skeleton formed by an alkaloid ergoline.[A32879] To know more about ergoloid mixtures, please visit [DB01049].Dihydroergocristine has been shown to present effect on memory and cognition. This activity in the brain is been reported by an increase in glutathione in age-related brain states.[A32880] The reported effect on serotonin and adrenergic receptors has also been correlated to an inhibition of platelet aggregation.[L2649] It has also been reported that individuals exposed to dihydroergocristine may present an amphoteric vasoregulating activity either hypotensive in hypertensive individuals or hypertensive in hypotensive individuals.[A32879] This action is performed by promoting a dilating action in the contracted arteries and a tonic action in the dilated arteries and arterioles.[L2649] The vasoregulating effect causes an increase in cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption by the brain, which correlates with the brain protective function of dihydroergocristine.[A32880] In Alzheimer studies, dihydroergocristine reduced the amyloid-beta levels in different cell types.[A32882] To know more about dihydroergocristine as part of the ergoloid mesylate mixture, please visit [DB01049].Dihydroergocristine mechanism of action seems to be related to a noncompetitive antagonistic activity in the serotonin receptors as well as a double partial agonist/antagonist activity in dopaminergic and adrenergic receptors.[A32880] In Alzheimer studies, dihydroergocristine act as a direct inhibitor of γ-secretase.[A32882]"
1541,"Indicated for the treatment of various skin conditions, such as atopic eczema and other inflammatory dermatoses. Bufexamac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) under the market name Droxaryl, Malipuran, Paraderm and Parfenac. It is typically administered topically for the treatment of subacute and chronic eczema of the skin, including atopic eczema and other inflammatory dermatoses, as well as sunburn and other minor burns, and itching. It has also been used in suppositories in combination with local anaesthetics indicated for haemorrhoids. The use of bufexamac has been discontinued in Canada and the United States, which may be due to undetermined clinical efficacy and a high prevalence of contact sensitization [A32822]. Bufexamac was also withdrawn by the EMA in April 2010.Bufexamac is a topically-active anti-inflammatory agent that inhibits the cyclooxygenase enzyme. In cutaneous and deep experimental inflammation, topical administration of bufexamac exerted a dose-related anti-inflammatory effect [A27192]. In guinea pigs, bufexamax was shown to be more active than topical acetylsalicylic acid 5% or phenylbutazone 5% in delaying the local increase in temperature resulting from UV exposure [A27192]. Bufexamac is unlikely to have any effect on wound healing [A27192].The full mechanism of action is unclear. It is proposed that bufexamac acts similarly to other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to inhibit prostaglandin biosynthesis _in vitro_, via inhibiting cyclo-oxygenase (COX) enzymes [A27192]. Systematically administered bufexamac may accumulate preferentially in the adrenal cortex of rats and may play a role in adrenal stimulation; however its topical anti-inflammatory action is likely to be independent of this effect [A27192].

Its use is restrained to the cases in which the administration of barium sulfate is not recommended or contraindicated.[F55] The intravascular administration of ioxitalamate is contraindicated as it may present significant side effects.[F54]Ioxitalamate is an ionic iodinated contrast medium.[A27209] It is a first-generation contrast media formed by an ionic monomer with a high osmolarity of 1500-1800 mOsm/kg.[A33006] Ioxitalamic acid in the salt forms of sodium and meglumine was developed by Liebel-Flarshem Canada Inc and approved by Health Canada in 1995. Until the last review in 2015, this drug is still available in the market.[L1113]Ioxitalamate presents a very large osmolality which is related to the presence of renal toxicity, vasodilatation, bradycardia and pulmonary hypertension. This large osmolality allows ioxitalamate to move slowly in the bowel allowing for analysis for later follow excretion in the feces.[A33016]Ioxitalamate acts as a bowel opacifier which facilitates the interpretation of the anatomy and differentiation of bowel loops from soft tissue masses.[F54]"

1549,"Midecamycin was used for the treatment of infections in the oral cavity, upper and lower respiratory tracts and skin and soft tissue infections. The alone use of midecamycin was mainly used in Europe or Japan.[T207] Midecamycin is a naturally occurring 16-membered macrolide[A33072] that fits under the category of acetoxy-substituted macrolide antibiotics. In this molecule, an acetoxy group is substituted on the position 9 of the 16-member ring and on position 4 of the terminal sugar.[A33075] Until 2017, midecamycin was still under the list of approved antimicrobial active pharmaceutical ingredients by Health Canada.[L2791]Reports have indicated that midecamycin is active against both erythromycin-susceptible and efflux-mediated erythromycin-resistant strains. The diacetate form of this product reduces gastrointestinal side effects and improves its pharmacokinetic profile.[A33072] Studies have proved that midecamycin is highly active against Gram-positive organisms.[T206] The activity of midecamycin in the form of acetate salt presents a better activity, which seems to be potentiated at pH 7-8, as well as a longer half-life.[A33083]Midecamycin, as part of the macrolides, act by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. More specifically, midecamycin inhibits bacterial growth by targetting the 50S ribosomal subunit preventing peptide bond formation and translocation during protein synthesis. The presence of mutations in the 50S RNA can prevent midecamycin binding. Midecamycin is a broad spectrum antibiotic and thus, it can interact with different bacteria.[T208]"
1550,"Cefodizime is a 3rd generation cephalosporin antibiotic with broad spectrum activity against aerobic gram positive and gram negative bacteria. Clinically, it has been shown to be effective against upper and lower respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, and gonorrhea. Cefodizime is a bactericidal antibiotic that targets penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) 1A/B, 2, and 3 resulting in the eventual death of the bacterial cell. In vivo experimental models of infection showed that bacterial clearance by this drug is at least as effective compared with other 3rd generation cephalosporins. It has similar adverse effect profile to other 3rd generation cephalosporins as well, mainly being limited to gastrointestinal or dermatological side effects."

1552,"Indicated for the management of gastric reflux, reflux oesophagitis, hiatus hernia, heartburn (including heartburn of pregnancy) and similar gastric distress [F46].Alginic acid, also referred to as algin or alginate, is a hydrophilic or anionic polysaccharide isolated from certain brown seaweed (_Phacophycae_) via alkaline extraction. It is present in cell walls of brown algae where it forms a viscous gel when binding with water. Alginic acid is a linear polymer consisted of L-glucuronic acid and D-mannuronic acid residues connected via 1,4-glycosidic linkages [A32961]. Available in different types of salt, alginic acid has been used in a variety of uses in food, cosmetics and pharmaceu-tical products for over 100 years [A32961]. Alginic acid is an FDA-approved food ingredient in soup and soup mixes as an emulsifier, thickener, and stabilizer [L2693]. It is also available in oral dietary supplements and is found in antacids such as Gaviscon to inhibit gastroesophageal reflux by creating a physical barrier in presence of gastric acid [F46]. Alginate-based raft-forming formulations in the management of heartburn and gastric acid reflux have been used worldwide for over 30 years [A32961].Alginic acid reduces reflux via its floating, foaming, and viscous properties [A27142]. Alginic acid precipitates upon contact with gastric acid to create a mechanical barrier, or a ""raft"", that displaces the postprandial acid pocket [A32960]. The formation of a raft is thought to occur rapidly, often within a few seconds of dosing [A32961]. In clinical trials, alginic acid was effective in reducing the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) [A32960]. In healthy volunteers, alginic acid in combination with an antacid was effective in decreasing postprandial reflux in the upright position [A27141]. Alginic acid is able to bind to cations when ingested [L2695]. Once orally administered, alginic acid reacts with gastric acid to form a floating ""raft"" of alginic acid gel on the gastric acid pool. Alginate-based raft-forming formulations commonly contain sodium or bicarbonate; bicarbonate ions are converted to carbon dioxide in presence of gastric acid and get entrapped within the gel precipitate, converting it into a foam which floats on the surface of the gastric contents, much like a raft on water [A32961]. The ""raft"" has a near neutral pH due to carbon dioxide and floats on the stomach contents and potentially functions as a barrier to impede gastroesophageal reflux [A27141, F46]. In severe cases, the raft itself may be refluxed into the oesophagus in preference to the stomach contents and exert a demulcent effect [F46]. "
1553,"Metergoline is an ergot-derived psychoactive drug that acts as a ligand for serotonin and dopamine receptors. Metergoline is an antagonist at various 5-HT receptor subtypes at a relatively low concentration and agonist at dopamine receptors.[A27181] Its use has been studied in various clinical settings such as a treatment for seasonal affective disorder, prolactin hormone regulation due to its inhibitory effect on prolactin release,[A27182] premenstrual dysphoric disorder in women and antianxiety treatment.[A27183]"

1556,"Ethenzamide (2-ethoxybenzamide) is a common analgesic and anti-inflammatory drug that is used for the relief of fever, headaches, and other minor aches and pains.It is also an ingredient in numerous cold medications and many prescription analgesics. It is used as an over-the-counter drug in Japan, owhere it is marketed for uses including toothache, menstrual cramps, headache, and fever.It is metabolized in vivo into salicylamide."
1557,"Almasilate is indicated for use as an antacid for the neutralization of excess stomach acid [F25]. It is subsequently also used for the symptomatic treatment of diseases where it is necessary to neutralize acid in the stomach, for example, for treating stomach and duodenal ulcers or heartburn and stomach conditions caused by excess stomach acid [F25].Almasilate is a buffering antacid that has been used in peptic ulcers and dyspepsia. It is a crystalline polyhydrate of aluminium/magnesium silicate and mediates its buffering activity by binding hydrogen ions within the polymer. However its therapeutic efficacy is not comparable to other approved antacids, as it is no more effective in neutralizing acid and binding bile salts than other conventional antacids [A27138].    Given that there are generally more widely available conventional antacids that are just as - if not more - effective than almasilate, almasilate products are only available in certain parts of Europe and/or Asia.Various non-prescription antacid products are available to the general public to purchase and use as a treatment for relieving the occasional, limited, and non-severe sensation of heartburn (or acid indigestion) that may frequently be associated with stomach indigestion (or dyspepsia) or gastroesophageal reflux disease (when stomach contents may rise back up into the esophagus and cause a taste of acid in the back of the mouth, among other symptoms) [A32834].    Subsequently, when excessive amounts of acids are produced in the stomach (either owing to indigestion or acid reflux, for example), the natural mucous barrier protecting the lining of the stomach can be damaged [A32834]. Antacids like almasilate consequently contain alkaline ions that chemically neutralize such stomach gastric acids, providing relief to heartburn, relieving pain, and reducing damage in the area [A32834].Almasilate is a crystalline polyhydrate of aluminum/magnesium silicate and mediates its buffering activity by binding hydrogen ions within the polymer [L2620]. Specifically, the aluminosilicate minerals dissolve, and in doing so consume acidic hydrogen ions and release moieties like H4SiO4, Al3+, and other cations, including the magnesium associated with the compound [L2620]. Almasilate consequently contributes to the overall acid-neutralization by consuming acid hydrogen ion in this way [L2620]. Additionally, aluminum and other metals released from the original compound may also accumulate into secondary aluminum and magnesium based antacid like products that can act as secondary pH buffers [L2620]."
1558,"Ximelagatran (Exanta or Exarta, H 376/95) is an anticoagulant that has been investigated extensively as a replacement for warfarin that would overcome the problematic dietary, drug interaction, and monitoring issues associated with warfarin therapy. In 2006, its manufacturer AstraZeneca announced that it would withdraw pending applications for marketing approval after reports of hepatotoxicity (liver damage) during trials, and discontinue its distribution in countries where the drug had been approved (Germany, Portugal, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Iceland, Austria, Denmark, France, Switzerland, Argentina and Brazil)."
1559,"Because of potassium’s wide-ranging roles in the body, low intakes can increase the risk of illness [L2655].    Potassium supplements are indicated to prevent hypokalemia in patients who would be at particular risk if hypokalemia were to develop (e.g., digitalis treated patients with significant cardiac arrhythmias). Potassium deficiency occurs when the rate of loss through renal excretion and/or loss from the gastrointestinal tract is higher than the rate of potassium intake. In addition to serving as a preventative supplement, potassium gluconate also serves as a treatment for decreased potassium levels [L2655], [L2651], [L2657].Potassium gluconate is a salt of [DB01345] and is classified as a food additive by the FDA [L2654]. It is also used as a potassium supplement [L2657].     Potassium is an essential nutrient. It is the most abundant cation in the intracellular fluid, where it plays a key role in maintaining cell function [A32222].    In dietary supplements, potassium is often present as potassium chloride, but many other forms—including potassium citrate, phosphate, aspartate, bicarbonate, and **gluconate**—are also used [L2652]. Potassium gluconate is believed to be more palatable and non-acidifying than potassium chloride (KCl) [L2658].Potassium is an essential nutrient. It is the most abundant cation in intracellular fluid, where it plays a key role in maintaining cell function, especially in excitable cells such as skeletal muscles, the heart,  and nerves [L2650].  Increases in interstitial potassium play an important role in eliciting rapid vasodilation, allowing for blood flow to increase in exercising muscle [L2660].  Potassium is the most abundant cation (approximately 150 to 160 mEq per liter) within human cells. Intracellular sodium content is relatively low. In the extracellular fluid, sodium predominates and the potassium content is low (3.5 to 5 mEq per liter). A membrane-bound enzyme, sodium-potassium–activated adenosinetriphosphatase (Na +K +ATPase), actively transports or pumps sodium out and potassium into cells to maintain the concentration gradients. The intracellular to extracellular potassium gradients are necessary for nerve impulse signaling in such specialized tissues as the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle, and for the maintenance of physiologic renal function and maintenance of acid-base balance. High intracellular potassium concentrations are necessary for numerous cellular metabolic processes [L2655].    Intracellular K+ serves as a reservoir to limit the fall in extracellular potassium concentrations occurring under pathologic conditions with loss of potassium from the body [L2660]."

As a therapeutic agent, is has been used in a vast variety of formulations as it is reported to be anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcer, anti-allergic, antioxidant, anti-tumor, anti-diabetic and hepatoprotective. Due to this properties, its indications have been: treatment of premenstrual syndrome, treatment of viral infections, anti-lipidemic and antihyperglycemic.[A33063] It is also known to be used as a remedy for peptic ulcer and other stomach diseases.[T205]Glycyrrhizic acid is extracted from the root of the licorice plant; Glycyrrhiza glabra.[F79] It is a triterpene glycoside with glycyrrhetinic acid that possesses a wide range of pharmacological and biological activities. When extracted from the plant, it can be obtained in the form of ammonium glycyrrhizin and mono-ammonium glycyrrhizin.[T204] Glycyrrhizic acid has been developed in Japan and China as a hepatoprotective drug in cases of chronic hepatitis.[A33062] From January 2014, glycyrrhizic acid as part of the licorice extract was approved by the FDA as an existing food sweetener.[F80] It was approved by Health Canada to be used in over-the-counter products but all the products are currently on the status canceled post marketed.[L1113]Glycyrrhizic acid was reported to present antiallergic, antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities as well as improvements in glucose tolerance.[A33062]     The effect of glycyrrhizic acid in metabolic syndrome generates a significant decrease in blood glucose, fasting blood glucose and mean serum insulin concentration.[A33063]Glycyrrhizic acid can be found in the alpha and beta forms. The alpha form is predominant in the liver and duodenum and thus, it is thought that the anti-inflammatory liver effect of this drug are mainly due to the action of this isomer. Glycyrrhizic acid anti-inflammatory effect is generated via suppression of TNF alpha and caspase 3. It also inhibits the translocation of NFkB into the nuclei and conjugates free radicals. Some studies have shown a glycyrrhizic-driven inhibition of CD4+ T cell proliferation via JNK, ERK and PI3K/AKT.[A33062]    The antiviral activity of glycyrrhizic acid includes the inhibition of viral replication and immune regulation.[A33062] The antiviral activity of glycyrrhizic acid seems to be of a broad spectrum and be able to cover several different viral types such as vaccinia virus, herpes simplex virus, Newcastle disease virus and vesicular stomatitis virus.[A33063]    The effect of glycyrrhizic acid on metabolism is thought to be related to its inhibitory activity towards 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 which in turn decreases the activity of hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. On the other hand, some studies have shown a potential lipoprotein lipase induction in non-hepatic tissues and thus it is suggested to enhance dyslipidemic conditions.[A33063]"

It is a potent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, derived from the indol-3-acetic acid, whose activity is thought to be mainly through its active metabolite indomethacin.[A31352] In clinical trials, acemetacin exhibits a better gastric tolerability compared to its active metabolite indometacin.[T50] It was developed by E. Merck and Company in Germany as an attempt to provide a safer drug but other than the amelioration on the gastrointestinal effects, the metabolism of acetamicin led to the formation of indomethacin and it kept the same side effects.[T51]The effect of acemetacin causes a weak reduction of prostaglandin synthesis which generates an anti-inflammatory and analgesic effect. The weak inhibition of prostaglandin reduces significantly the damage caused in the mucous membrane of the gastrointestinal tract. Studies have shown that acemetacin strongly inhibits the release of histamine from mast cells and the generation of hyperthermia. Acemetacin effect also causes changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure as well as inhibition of platelet aggregation.[A31353] Acemetacin is a non-selective inhibitor of the production of pro-inflammatory mediators derived from the action of the enzyme COX. COX is essential for the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 and F2 which are molecules derived from fatty acids and stored in the cell membrane.[T52] Acetometacine is metabolized and forms its major metabolite indometacin which is also a non-selective inhibitor of COX and exhibits the capacity to inhibit the motility of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and decreased cerebral flow by modulating the nitric oxide pathway and vasoconstriction.[T51]"

1572,"No approved therapeutic indications. Iodoform is an organoiodine compound with the formula CHI3 and a tetrahedral molecular geometry. It is a relatively water-insoluble yellow solid that is chemically reactive in free-radical reactions [A32890]. Due to its antimicrobial properties following topical administration, minimal levels of iodoform may be found in disinfectants and it is more primarily used for veterinary purposes. Since the beginning of the 20th century, iodoform has been commonly used as a healing and antiseptic dressing or powder for wounds and sores, however such clinical use to this date is limited. Iodoform is soluble in fatty acids and decomposes releasing iodine in nascent state (96,7% of iodine) when in contact with secretions or endodontic infections [A32893].Iodoform exhibits antibacterial activities after topical application. In a comparative study of wound dressing agents, iodoform gauze exerted an antibacterial effect 3 hours after the start of bacterial growth of _E. coli_ and subsequently maintained the strong antibacterial effectiveness [A32896]. A study demonstrated that direct and indirect exposure to high concentrations of iodoform induces a cytotoxic effect on cultures of macrophages and epithelial cells _in vitro_, while cell proliferation was enhanced at low concentrations of iodoform [A32895]. This cytotoxic effect of iodoform in root canals may further lead to long-term local irritation to follicles of permanent successors and formation of cyst-like radiolucent defects [A32895].While the mechanism of action of iodoform remains unclear, it is proposed that iodoform releases iodine, which denatures bacterial proteins by oxidation of the free iodine [A32896]. Iodoform may also play a role in chemical debridement for effective necrotic wound healing and tissue damage repair via collagen fibrinolysis; upon treatment in necrotic tissue, iodoform reduced the size of the macromolecules containing collagen I in wound surface proteins [A32894]. In human gingival fibroblasts _in vitro_, high concentrations of iodoform was shown to decrease the viability of macrophages and epithelial cells and reduced the secretion of _P. gingivalis_-induced TNFα [A32895]. P. gingivalis is an anaerobic bacteria present in anaerobic oral niches including periapical sites and periodontal pockets [A32895]. "

1585,"This medication is a genetically modified oncolytic viral therapy indicated for the local treatment of unresectable, cutaneous, subcutaneous, and nodal lesions in patients with melanoma recurrent after initial surgery [FDA Label]. Elsewhere, the EMA notes that the agent is indicated for the treatment of adults with unresectable melanoma that is regionally or distantly metastatic (Stage IIIB, IIIC, and IVM1a) with no bone, brain, lung, or other visceral diseases [L2209].Talimogene laherparepvec is an oncolytic treatment used in local treatment of unresectable cutaneous, subcutaneous, and nodal lesions in patients with recurrent melanoma. It is a genetically administered herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) that expresses human cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) with antitumor and immune-stimulating activities. It specifically replicates within tumor cells and causes lysis. It was approved by the FDA in 2015 under the market name Imlygic.    In general, talimogene laherparepvec has been modified so that it can infect and multiply inside melanoma cells [L2221]. The drug subsequently uses the melanoma cells' own machinery to multiply, eventually overwhelming the melanoma cells and killing them [L2221]. Alternatively, although talimogene laherparepvec also enters healthy cells, it is not designed to multiply inside them [L2221].Talimogene laherparepvec has been genetically modified to replicate within tumors and to produce the immune stimulatory protein GM-CSF (granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor) [FDA Label]. The medication causes lysis of tumors, followed by the release of tumor-derived antigens, which together with virally derived GM-CSF may promote an anti-tumor immune response in the body [FDA Label].Talimogene laherparepvec is an oncolytic immunotherapy that is derived from Herpes Simplex Virus type-1 (HSV-1) [L2212]. It has been modified to replicate within tumor cells and to produce the immune response stimulatory protein, human GM-CSF (granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor) [L2212]. The medication causes the death of tumor cells and the release of tumor-derived antigens [L2212]. It is believed that together with GM-CSF, talimogene laherparepvec can promote a systemic anti-tumor immune response and an effector T-cell response [L2212]. Mice subjects involved in talimogene laherparepvec treatment studies that had complete regression of their primary tumors following therapy were resistant to subsequent tumor rechallenge [L2212].    The genetic modifications to talimogene laherparepvec from HSV-1 include deletion of the ICP34.5 and ICP47 genes [L2212]. Whereas anti-viral immune responses defend normal cells following infection by talimogene laherparepvec, tumors have been shown to be susceptible to injury and cell death from ICP34.5-deficient HSV-1 derived viruses, including talimogene laherparepvec [L2212]. Moreover, deletion of ICP47 prevents the down-regulation of antigen presentation molecules in the targeted tumor cells and increases the expression of the HSV US11 gene, thereby enhancing the talimogene laherparepvec viral replication in tumor cells and increases chances of tumor cell injury and death [L2212].    Although the talimogene laherparepvec virus is specifically modified to infect and multiply inside melanoma cells and uses melanoma cells' own machinery to multiply, the medication is not designed to multiply inside healthy cells, which it is also capable of entering [L2221]."
1586,"The most common medical purpose for which bismuth subgallate is currently and formally indicated for is the use as a non-prescription internal deodorant product for the purpose of deodorizing flatulence and stools [L2309, L2312, A32566].    Additionally, there are also various non-prescription (over the counter) bismuth subgallate based wound healing products as well as ongoing studies into whether or not the substance can be utilized as a legitimate hemostatic agent - usually for soft tissue surgery in otorhinolaryngology and/or dermatologic settings [A32567, A32568, A32569, A32570].    Moreover, in the past bismuth subgallate may have seen some use as a treatment for Helicobacter pylori infection [A32571]. In contrast, contemporary first-line therapies generally involve proton pump inhibitor and antibiotic combination therapies that generally achieve high rates of pathogen eradication, ease of administration, and patient compliance.Bismuth subgallate is a yellow colored substance that presents as an odorless powder that undergoes discoloration when exposed to sunlight. It is a heavy metal salt of gallic acid that is highly insoluble and poorly absorbed. Possessing protective effects on the gastric mucosa, strong astringent effects, and not as yet elucidated antimicrobial and hemostatic actions, bismuth subgallate is most commonly available as an over-the-counter internal deodorant where it is often employed as the primary active ingredient.Bismuth subgallate is a heavy metal salt that is relatively insoluble and poorly absorbed [A32569, L2314]. As a result, systemic absorption is not necessary [L2314] or possibly even desired when the agent is administered orally or onto specific otorhinolaryngology and/or dermatologic wound sites where it can execute its pharmacologic action directly within the gastrointestinal lumen [L2314] to deodorize flatulence and stools or potentially elicit a hemostatic effect on wounds [A32569].    Additionally, like other bismuth agents, one of the most common side effects associated with bismuth subgallate is its propensity to cause a black discoloration of the tongue and stools when the agent combines with trace amounts of sulfur in the saliva and/or gastrointestinal tract [L2316]. This discoloration is temporary and harmless, gradually dissipating over a number of days and eventually disappearing after the discontinuation of the bismuth agent [L2316].Bismuth salts exert their action largely in the upper gastrointestinal tract by way of local activity from luminal bismuth in the stomach and duodenum [A32571].    In terms of bismuth subgallate's ability to deodorize flatulence and stools as an internal deodorant - although not fully elucidated - it is believed that when the substance is administered orally, its relative insolubility and poor absorption allows it to remain within the gastrointestinal lumen and inhibit colonic bacteria from acting on fermentable food residues in the GI tract [L2314].    Moreover, when bismuth subgallate is taken orally, various salts like bismuth citrate, bismuth oxychloride, and others are formed [A32571]. These salts are then taken up into surrounding gastric mucus as well as bound to protein within the base of any ulcers that may be present after coming into contact with gastric juice [A32571]. Additionally, bismuth compounds like bismuth subgallate are also believed to have the capacity to trigger the secretion of prostaglandins, epithelial growth factor (EGF), and mucosal bicarbonate as a means to inhibit the action of pepsin in gastric juice [A32571]. These actions subsequently protect gastric mucous from peptic luminal degradation as well as enhance the properties of mucous to assist in the healing of both duodenal and gastric ulcers [A32571]. In this way, bismuth subgallate works to absorb extra water and/or toxins in the large intestine, allowing it to form a protective coat on the intestinal mucosa and over ulcers that may or may not be associated with infections like those of Helicobacter pylori [L2312].    Furthermore, studies have shown that bismuth compounds like bismuth subgallate are capable of demonstrating antimicrobial effects against various gastrointestinal tract pathogens like E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella, Vibrio cholera, Campylobacter jejuni, H. pylori, and some enteric viruses like Rotaviruses [A32571]. Although the exact mechanism(s) of action by which bismuth compounds are able to elicit such antimicrobial effects remains unclear [A32571], a number of experimental observations suggest that bismuth has been able to complex with the bacterial wall and periplasmic membrane; inhibit bacterial enzymes like urease, catalase, and lipase; inhibit bacterial protein and ATP synthesis; and also inhibit or decrease the adherence of bacteria like H. pylori to epithelial cells [A32571]. In essence, ultrastructural studies have shown evidence of the binding of bismuth complexes to the bacterial wall and periplasmic space between the inner and outer bacterial membrane of H.pylori with subsequent ballooning and disintegration of the pathogen [A32571]. To various extents, these antimicrobial actions may also illustrate how bismuth subgallate is capable of neutralizing colonic bacteria from acting on fermentable foods as well.    Numerous studies have and continue to study the possible hemostatic action that bismuth subgallate may have. As the bismuth salt of gallic acid, bismuth subgallate's chemical structure shares similarities to ellagic acid, another gallic acid derivative [A32572]. Ellagic acid itself is a clot-promoting agent that initiates thrombin formation by way of the intrinsic pathway via an  action on Hageman factor (clotting factor XII) [A32572, A32569]. It is believed that bismuth subgallate's ability to activate factor XII is associated with the chemical's negatively charged moieties - whose contact with factor XII would theoretically initiate the intrinsic pathway to blood clotting [A32572].    Other studies have also suggested that bismuth subgallate is capable of inducing macrophages to secrete growth factors to facilitate wound healing, decreasing lesion area, enhancing granulation tissue formation and re-epithelialization, the initiation of the proliferation of collagen via the activation of fibroblasts, the accelerated re-establishment of blood vessels, and also the restriction of nitric oxide formation [A32570, A32578].    Given such studies regarding bismuth subgallate's potential hemostatic abilities, there has been and continues to be interest in indicating the agent for use in otolaryngology as in tonsillectomies or adenotonsillectomies to achieve reduced bleeding and surgery times; topical treatment in various open wound surgeries to facilitate faster and earlier clotting between tissues; ileostomy; dental surgeries; epistaxis management; among others [A32567, A32569]. Nevertheless, study results are conflicting; where there may be experimental results suggesting some improvements in reduced operation time and operative blood loss when bismuth subgallate is used as a hemostatic agent in tonsillectomies [A32572] there are also study results that observed bismuth subgallate having a negative influence on the healing processes of wounds inflicted in animal models, in which the use of the agent actually delayed the rate of new vessel formation and optimal wound healing [A32569].    Finally, bismuth subgallate also demonstrates a strong astringent ability [A32569] - an action that can facilitate both its deodorant and hemostatic effects and assists in its indication as an active ingredient in a number of non-prescription products for hemorrhoid suppositories or topical applications, diarrhea, etc [L2314]."

1588,"Testosterone cypionate is used in males that present conditions derived from a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone. These conditions are 1) primary hypogonadism, defined as the testicular failure due to cryptorchidism, bilateral torsion, orchitis, vanishing testis syndrome or orchidectomy; and 2) hypogonadotropic hypogonadism characterized by idiopathic gonadotropin, LHRH deficiency or pituitary-hypothalamic injury from tumors, trauma or radiation.[L1153]Testosterone cypionate is a synthetic derivative of testosterone in the form of an oil-soluble 17 (beta)-cyclopentylpropionate ester. Its benefit compared to other testosterone derivatives is the slow rate of release after injection and longer half-life. It was developed by the company Pharmacia and Upjohn and FDA approved on July 25, 1979.Administration of ester derivatives of testosterone as testosterone cypionate generates an increase in serum testosterone to levels reaching 400% from the baseline within 24 hours of administration. These androgen levels remain elevated for 3-5 days after initial administration.[A31612] The continuous variation in plasma testosterone after intramuscular administration of testosterone cypionate results in fluctuations in mood and libido as well as some local inflammation.[A31613]The effects of testosterone in humans and other vertebrates occur by way of two main mechanisms: by activation of the androgen receptor (directly or as DHT), and by conversion to estradiol and activation of certain estrogen receptors. Free testosterone (T) is transported into the cytoplasm of target tissue cells, where it can bind to the androgen receptor, or can be reduced to 5-alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the cytoplasmic enzyme 5-alpha-reductase. DHT binds to the same androgen receptor even more strongly than T, so that its androgenic potency is about 2.5 times that of T. The T-receptor or DHT-receptor complex undergoes a structural change that allows it to move into the cell nucleus and bind directly to specific nucleotide sequences of the chromosomal DNA. The areas of binding are called hormone response elements (HREs), and influence transcriptional activity of certain genes, producing the androgen effects.[A950]"
1589,"Femring is indicated for the treatment of vasomotor and urogenital symptoms associated with menopause. Use of Femring (estradiol acetate) has been shown to improve symptoms caused by atrophy of the vagina (such as dryness, burning, pruritus and dyspareunia) and/or the lower urinary tract (urinary urgency and dysuria).Estradiol acetate is a pro-drug ester of [DB00783], a naturally occurring hormone that circulates endogenously within the human body. Estradiol is the most potent form of all mammalian estrogenic steroids and acts as the major female sex hormone. As a pro-drug of estradiol, estradiol acetate therefore has the same downstream effects within the body through binding to the Estrogen Receptor (ER) including ERα and ERβ subtypes, which are located in various tissues including in the breasts, uterus, ovaries, skin, prostate, bone, fat, and brain.    [DB00783] is commonly produced with an ester side-chain as endogenous estradiol has very low oral bioavailability on its own (2-10%). First-pass metabolism by the gut and the liver quickly degrades the estradiol molecule before it gets a chance to enter systemic circulation and exert its estrogenic effects [A12102]. Esterification of estradiol aims to improves absorption and bioavailability after oral administration (such as with Estradiol valerate) or to sustain release from depot intramuscular injections (such as with Estradiol Cypionate) through improved lipophilicity. Following absorption, the esters are cleaved, resulting in the release of endogenous estradiol, or 17β-estradiol. Ester pro-drugs of estradiol are therefore considered to be bioidentical forms of estrogen [T84].    Estradiol acetate is commercially available as Femring, a vaginal ring used for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms and vulvovaginal atrophy due to menopause.    The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. However, after menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone by peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women [FDA Label]. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol at the receptor level. Because of the difference in potency between estradiol and estrone, menopause (and a change in primary hormone from estradiol to estrone) is associated with a number of symptoms associated with this reduction in potency and in estrogenic effects. These include hot flashes, vaginal dryness, mood changes, irregular menses, chills, and sleeping problems. Administration of synthetic and bioidentical forms of estrogen, such as estradiol acetate, has shown to improve these menopausal symptoms.Estrogen mediates its effects across the body through potent agonism of the Estrogen Receptor (ER), which is located in various tissues including in the breasts, uterus, ovaries, skin, prostate, bone, fat, and brain. Estradiol binds to both subtypes of the Estrogen Receptor: Estrogen Receptor Alpha (ERα) and Estrogen Receptor Beta (ERβ). Estradiol also acts as a potent agonist of G Protein-coupled Estrogen Receptor (GPER), which has recently been recognized as a major mediator of estradiol's rapid cellular effects [A31620]. Estradiol enters target cells freely (e.g., female organs, breasts, hypothalamus, pituitary) and interacts with a target cell receptor. When the estrogen receptor has bound its ligand it can enter the nucleus of the target cell, and regulate gene transcription which leads to formation of messenger RNA. The mRNA interacts with ribosomes to produce specific proteins that express the effect of estradiol upon the target cell. Estrogens increase the hepatic synthesis of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), thyroid-binding globulin (TBG), and other serum proteins and suppress follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary.    Increases in the down-stream effects of ER binding reverses some of the symptoms of menopause, which are primarily caused by a loss of estrogenic activity. "

1592,"Baloxavir marboxil is an influenza virus polymerase acidic (PA) endonuclease inhibitor indicated for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza in patients who have been symptomatic for no more than 48 hours and who are otherwise healthy adults and pediatric patients five years of age and older, or patients 12 years of age and older who are at high risk of developing influenza-related complications.[L42855]     The drug is also indicated for post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza in patients five years of age and older following contact with an individual who has influenza.[L42855] In Europe, it is approved for use in patients aged one year and above for these indications.[L45241]    Baloxavir marboxil is associated with a risk for loss of efficacy due to changes in influenza virus such as changes in virus subtypes, emergence of virus resistance, and changes in viral virulence; therefore, the drug should be used after considering available information on drug susceptibility patterns for circulating influenza virus strains.[L42855]Baloxavir marboxil is an antiviral drug used to treat influenza. More specifically, it is a first-in-class cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor that works to block influenza virus proliferation.[A39895, A251755] It is a prodrug of [baloxavir] [L42855] with an improved absorption profile than its active metabolite due to the addition of a phenolic hydroxyl group to its structure.[A251760] Baloxavir marboxil was first globally approved in Japan in February 2018,[A39895] followed by the US approval in October, 2018.[L4779] It was also approved by the European Commission on January 7, 2021.[L45241]Baloxavir marboxil is an antiviral drug that works against influenza virus to block viral replication. It has an 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 1.4 to 3.1 nM for influenza A viruses and 4.5 to 8.9 nM for influenza B viruses in a polymerase acidic (PA) endonuclease assay.[L42855] In murine models of influenza and avian influenza A, baloxavir reduced pulmonary viral loads and increased survival rates of mice.[A39894] The reduction of viral titer was observed within 24 hours of administration, in a dose-dependent manner.[A39895]The influenza virus RNA polymerase complex is a heterotrimer made up of three protein subunits - polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1), polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2), and polymerase acidic protein (PA).[A39894] This polymerase complex is an influenza virus-specific enzyme essential for viral gene transcription and replication,[L42855] with its subunits playing different roles in viral mRNA synthesis. The PB2 subunit binds to the cap of host cellular pre-messenger RNA, allowing the PA protein - a cap-dependent endonuclease - to cleave the capped pre-messenger RNA.[A39894, A251760] This initial step of mRNA synthesis by the PA protein, also known as the ""cap-snatching process,"" provides an RNA primer for the PB1 subunit, which carries out its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase function to proceed with viral mRNA transcription.[A39894]     After administration, the prodrug baloxavir marboxil is almost completely hydrolyzed by esterases in the gastrointestinal lumen, intestinal epithelium, liver and blood [A251755] to its active metabolite, baloxavir.[L42855] Baloxavir selectively inhibits the PA protein,[L42855] blocking the initiation of mRNA synthesis and ultimately influenza virus proliferation.[A39895] Cap-dependent endonuclease is a highly conserved region across influenza strains;[A251760] however, baloxavir is still vulnerable to resistance because amino acid substitutions in the PA protein can lead to reduced viral susceptibility to baloxavir.[L42855]"
1593,"Moroctocog alfa is indicated for use in adults and children with hemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) for on-demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes, perioperative management, and routine prophylaxis to reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes.[L41160, L41165, L41170]Moroctocog alfa, also known as BDDrFVIII (B domain deleted recombinant factor VIII), is a recombinant DNA-based drug with functional characteristics comparable to those of endogenous coagulation Factor VIII, the essential human blood clotting protein that is impaired in Hemophilia A. Moroctocog alfa is identical in sequence to endogenously produced Factor VIII, but does not contain the B-domain, which has no known biological function. Moroctocog alfa is produced through recombinant DNA technology and purification, resulting in a 1438 amino acid, 170 kDa protein [FDA Label]. Clinical evaluation has shown that BDDrFVIII is pharmacokinetically equivalent to full-length recombinant FVIII [A32468, FDA Label].    Also known as Anti-Hemophilic Factor (AHF), endogenous Factor VIII is essential to the clotting process in the body due to its involvement in the clotting cascade where it is responsible for acting as a co-factor to Factor IX. Activation of Factor IX leads to a cascade of signals that results in activation of Factor X, which then results in the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, and as a result, leads to the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, the fibrous protein that creates the scaffold of the clot. Replacement of Factor VIII is essential for the treatment of Hemophilia A, which is caused by mutations in the Factor VIII gene, leading to a functional deficiency or complete loss of protein. Congenital loss or deficiency of Factor VIII results in the physiologic impairment of the coagulation clotting cascade, and as a result, leads to easy bruising and bleeding. Bleeding can range in severity from minor concerns, such as nosebleeds, to more serious events such as hemorrhaging in the joints, brain, or digestive tract [A32280].    Exogenous replacement of Factor VIII is currently the cornerstone of Hemophilia treatment and is used for the prophylaxis and control of bleeding episodes. Treatment has drastically improved since the 1960s when Factor VIII protein was primarily purified from human plasma, rather than being produced through recombinant DNA technology. Unfortunately, purification of protein from human plasma carries an increased risk of transmission of blood-borne diseases such as HIV and Hepatitis, which in part contributed to the Tainted Blood Scandal in the 1980s [A31551, A32272, L2177]. Use of recombinant DNA-derived clotting factor treatments, such as Moroctocog alfa, has reduced this risk.    Other drug products with similar structure and function to Moroctocog alfa include [DB13192], which is purified Factor VIII from human pooled blood and contains both A- and B-subunits, and [DB11607], which is a fully recombinant factor VIII-Fc fusion protein which has an extended half-life compared with conventional factor VIII due to conjugation to the dimeric Fc domain of human immunoglobulin G1, a long-lived plasma protein [A31551].    Moroctocog alfa is approved by Health Canada and by the European Medicines Agency for the control and prevention of hemorrhagic episodes and for routine and surgical prophylaxis in patients with hemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency or classic hemophilia). As it does not contain von Willebrand factor it is not indicated in von Willebrand’s disease [FDA Label].Antihemophilic Factor binds factor IXa along with calcium and phospholipid, which converts factor X to factor Xa to facilitate the clotting cascade. Antihemophilic factor (AHF) is a protein found in normal plasma which is necessary for clot formation. The administration of AHF provides an increase in plasma levels of AHF and can temporarily correct the coagulation defect of patients with hemophilia A (classical hemophilia). As factor VIII is the specific clotting factor deficient in patients with hemophilia A, replacement of clotting factor with Moroctocog alfa, also known as BDDrFVIII (B domain deleted recombinant factor VIII), is the cornerstone of the prevention and treatment of bleeding for this disorder.

It may help relieve some muscle cramps.Alpha-tocopherol is the primary form of vitamin E that is preferentially used by the human body to meet appropriate dietary requirements. In particular, the RRR-alpha-tocopherol (or sometimes called the d-alpha-tocopherol stereoisomer) stereoisomer is considered the natural formation of alpha-tocopherol and generally exhibits the greatest bioavailability out of all of the alpha-tocopherol stereoisomers. Moreover, RRR-alpha-tocopherol acetate is a relatively stabilized form of vitamin E that is most commonly used as a food additive when needed [A32451].    Alpha-tocopherol acetate is subsequently most commonly indicated for dietary supplementation in individuals who may demonstrate a genuine deficiency in vitamin E. Vitamin E itself is naturally found in various foods, added to others, or used in commercially available products as a dietary supplement. The recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) for vitamin E alpha-tocopherol are: males = 4 mg (6 IU) females = 4 mg (6 IU) in ages 0-6 months, males = 5 mg (7.5 IU) females = 5 mg (7.5 IU) in ages 7-12 months, males = 6 mg (9 IU) females = 6 mg (9 IU) in ages 1-3 years, males = 7 mg (10.4 IU) females = 7 mg (10.4 IU) in ages 4-8 years, males = 11 mg (16.4 IU) females = 11 mg (16.4 IU) in ages 9-13 years, males = 15 mg (22.4 IU) females = 15 mg (22.4 IU) pregnancy = 15 mg (22.4 IU) lactation = 19 mg (28.4 IU) in ages 14+ years [L2120]. Most individuals obtain adequate vitamin E intake from their diets; genuine vitamin E deficiency is considered to be rare.    Nevertheless, vitamin E is known to be a fat-soluble antioxidant that has the capability to neutralize endogenous free radicals. This biologic action of vitamin E consequently continues to generate ongoing interest and study in whether or not its antioxidant abilities may be used to help assist in preventing or treating a number of different conditions like cardiovascular disease, ocular conditions, diabetes, cancer and more. At the moment however, there exists a lack of formal data and evidence to support any such additional indications for vitamin E use._In addition to any following information, owing to d-alpha-Tocopherol acetate's closely related chemical nature with alpha-Tocopherol acetate, please also refer to the drug information page for alpha-Tocopherol acetate for further data.Vitamin E has antioxidant activity. It may also have anti-atherogenic, antithrombotic, anticoagulant, neuroprotective, antiviral, immunomodulatory, cell membrane-stabilizing and antiproliferative actions. Vitamin E is a collective term used to describe eight separate forms, the best-known form being alpha-tocopherol. Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin and is an important antioxidant. It acts to protect cells against the effects of free radicals, which are potentially damaging by-products of the body's metabolism. Vitamin E is often used in skin creams and lotions because it is believed to play a role in encouraging skin healing and reducing scarring after injuries such as burns. There are three specific situations when a vitamin E deficiency is likely to occur. It is seen in persons who cannot absorb dietary fat, has been found in premature, very low birth weight infants (birth weights less than 1500 grams, or 3&frac12; pounds), and is seen in individuals with rare disorders of fat metabolism. A vitamin E deficiency is usually characterized by neurological problems due to poor nerve conduction. Symptoms may include infertility, neuromuscular impairment, menstrual problems, miscarriage and uterine degradation. Preliminary research has led to a widely held belief that vitamin E may help prevent or delay coronary heart disease. Antioxidants such as vitamin E help protect against the damaging effects of free radicals, which may contribute to the development of chronic diseases such as cancer. It also protects other fat-soluble vitamins (A and B group vitamins) from destruction by oxygen. Low levels of vitamin E have been linked to increased incidence of breast and colon cancer.In addition to any following information, owing to d-alpha-Tocopherol acetate's closely related chemical nature with alpha-Tocopherol acetate, please also refer to the drug information page for alpha-Tocopherol acetate for further data. Although all forms of Vitamin E exhibit antioxidant activity, it is known that the antioxidant activity of vitamin E is not sufficient to explain the vitamin's biological activity. Vitamin E's anti-atherogenic activity involves the inhibition of the oxidation of LDL and the accumulation of oxLDL in the arterial wall. It also appears to reduce oxLDL-induced apoptosis in human endothelial cells. Oxidation of LDL is a key early step in atherogenesis as it triggers a number of events which lead to the formation of atherosclerotic plaque. In addition, vitamin E inhibits protein kinase C (PKC) activity. PKC plays a role in smooth muscle cell proliferation, and, thus, the inhibition of PKC results in inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation, which is involved in atherogenesis.Vitamin E's antithrombotic and anticoagulant activities involves the downregulation of the expression of intracellular cell adhesion molecule(ICAM)-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule(VCAM)-1 which lowers the adhesion of blood components to the endothelium. In addition, vitamin E upregulates the expression of cytosolic phospholipase A2 and cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 which in turn enhances the release of prostacyclin. Prostacyclin is a vasodilating factor and inhibitor of platelet aggregation and platelet release. It is also known that platelet aggregation is mediated by a mechanism involving the binding of fibrinogen to the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) complex of platelets. GPIIb/IIIa is the major membrane receptor protein that is key to the role of the platelet aggregation response. GPIIb is the alpha-subunit of this platelet membrane protein. Alpha-tocopherol downregulates GPIIb promoter activity which results in reduction of GPIIb protein expression and decreased platelet aggregation. Vitamin E has also been found in culture to decrease plasma production of thrombin, a protein which binds to platelets and induces aggregation. A metabolite of vitamin E called vitamin E quinone or alpha-tocopheryl quinone (TQ) is a potent anticoagulant. This metabolite inhibits vitamin K-dependent carboxylase, which is a major enzyme in the coagulation cascade.The neuroprotective effects of vitamin E are explained by its antioxidant effects. Many disorders of the nervous system are caused by oxidative stress. Vitamin E protects against this stress, thereby protecting the nervouse system. The immunomodulatory effects of Vitamin E have been demonstrated in vitro, where alpha-tocopherol increases mitogenic response of T lymphocytes from aged mice. The mechanism of this response by vitamin E is not well understood, however it has been suggested that vitamin E itself may have mitogenic activity independent of its antioxidant activity. Lastly, the mechanism of action of vitamin E's antiviral effects (primarily against HIV-1) involves its antioxidant activity. Vitamin E reduces oxidative stress, which is thought to contribute to HIV-1 pathogenesis, as well as to the pathogenesis of other viral infections. Vitamin E also affects membrane integrity and fluidity and, since HIV-1 is a membraned virus, altering membrane fluidity of HIV-1 may interfere with its ability to bind to cell-receptor sites, thus decreasing its infectivity."

Upon administration, downregulation of Th17 and Th22 cell responses occur [A32255].    IL-23 is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in inflammatory and immune responses. Tildrakizumab inhibits the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines [FDA label]."
1596,"The oral gel is indicated for the relief of pain and discomfort of common mouth ulcers, cold sores, denture sore spots, infant teething and mouth ulcers, and sore spots due to orthodontic devices in children [L2135].    Choline salicylate is an anti-inflammatory pain reliever agent that is related to aspirin. It is used to decrease swelling and to treat mild-moderate pain. It is used to treat arthritis in both children and adults. This medicine can also be used for fever [L2129].    Choline Salicylate is the choline salt of salicylic acid, used as an analgesic, antipyretic and antirheumatic. It relieves mild to moderate pain and reduce fever and inflammation or swelling. Choline salicylate is effective in the treatment of gout, rheumatic fever, rheumatoid arthritis and muscle injuries [A245119].    This drug is also a main ingredient in teething gels to relieve pains associated with tooth growth in the infant population [L2134].  The UK government has regulated its use, due to toxicity in those under 16 years of age.  Topical oral salicylate gels are no longer indicated for people younger than 16 years for pain associated with infant teething, orthodontic devices, cold sores, or mouth ulcers [L2134].This is an anti-inflammatory and antipyretic medication [L2132], [L2133].

It also inhibits the generation of impulses through the inhibition of cyclooxygenase enzyme (COX) [L2132], [A245119].      Cyclooxygenase is involved in the production of prostaglandins, in response to injury and after various other stimuli. The prostaglandins promote pain, swelling, and inflammation. The choline salicylate decreases inflammation and pain by reducing the production of these prostaglandins in the area of the mouth it is applied to [L2137]."
1597,"This drug is indicated for the treatment of X-linked hypophosphatemia with radiological evidence of bone disease in children of 1 year of age and older and adolescents with growing skeletons [L2347].Burosumab (KRN23) is an entirely human monoclonal IgG1 antibody that binds excess fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and has been successfully tested in clinical trials in children with X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets [A32593].      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Crysvita (burosumab) in April 2018. This is the first drug approved to treat adults and children ages 1 year and older with X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH), which is a rare, inherited form of rickets. X-linked hypophosphatemia causes low circulating levels of phosphorus in the blood. It causes impaired bone growth and development in children and adolescents and issues with bone mineralization throughout a patient’s life  [L2346].    XLH is a serious disease which affects about 3,000 children and 12,000 adults in the United States. Most children with XLH suffer from bowed or bent legs, short stature, bone pain and severe dental pain. Some adults with this condition suffer from persistent, unrelenting discomfort and complications, such as joint pain, impaired mobility, tooth abscesses and hearing loss [L2346].This drug has the ability to reduce the loss of phosphate, to improve pathologically low serum phosphate concentrations and other metabolic changes, as well as to reduce the severity of rickets as seen radiographically [L2348]. In summary, this drug works to support of bone mineralization [L2347].Burosumab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody (IgG1) that both binds to and inhibits the actions of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23). By inhibiting this growth factor, burosumab increases the tubular reabsorption of phosphate from the kidney and thus increases serum concentration of 1, 25 dihydroxy-Vitamin D [L2347].  This form of vitamin D enhances intestinal absorption of phosphate and calcium, supporting bone mineralization [L2351].    "

1605,"Aripiprazole lauroxil is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders.Aripiprazole lauroxil is a long-acting injectable atypical antipsychotic drug used in the treatment of schizophrenia in adult patients.Affecting about 1% of the adult population in the United States and approximately 26 million people worldwide, schizophrenia is a chronic neurological disorder that may result in impairments in cognition and executive functions [A34289]. The quality of life in patients is greatly reduced due to negative health outcomes, and oftentimes the patients are faced with social stigma and discriminations. Schizophrenia is characterized by positive symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, thought disorders, and catanoia, and negative symptoms that include social withdrawal, anhedonia, and flattening of emotional responses [T28]. D2 receptors have been the most common target for antipsychotic agents used in the treatment of schizophrenia: the positive symptoms are thought to arise from overactivity in the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway activating D2 receptors, whereas  negative symptoms may result from a decreased activity in the mesocortical dopaminergic pathway with D1 receptors predominating [T28]. In a randomized, double-blind clinical trial, treatment of aripiprazole lauroxil in adult patients with schizophrenia resulted in improvement of positive and negative symptoms scores at day 85 of treatment [A34289, A34301].     Aripiprazole lauroxil was initially approved by the FDA in October 2015 under the market name Aristada for the treatment of schizophrenia. It is administered via intramuscular injection, and requires the establishment of tolerability prior to dosing in treatment-naïve patients [FDA Label]. On July 2nd, a different formulation of aripiprazole lauroxil marketed as Aristada Initio was FDA-approved for immediate initiation of Aristada at any dose.Long-acting injectable aripiprazole lauroxil displayed comparable efficacy and safety to aripiprazole [A34301], and reduced dosing frequency improves patient adherence.Aripiprazole, which is a major pharmacological metabolite of aripiprazole lauroxil, serves to improve the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia by modulating dopaminergic signalling pathways. Aripiprazole lauroxil is reported to have minimal effects on sexual function or prolactin levels [T28]. The pharmacological activity of aripiprazole lauroxil is thought to be mainly mediated by its metabolite aripiprazole, and to a lesser extent, dehydro-aripiprazole. Aripiprazole functions as a partial agonist at the dopamine D2 and the serotonin 5-HT1A receptors, and as an antagonist at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor [FDA Label]. The desired outcome of antipsuchotic agents in schizophrenia is to inhibit dopaminergic transmission in the limbic system and enhance dopaminergic transmission in the prefrontal cortex. As a partial agonist at D2 receptors in the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway, aripiprazole acts as a functional antagonist in the mesolimbic dopamine pathway and reduces the extent of dopaminergic pathway activity. This results in reduced positive symptoms in schizophrenia and extrapyramidal motor side effects [A34403]. In contrast, aripiprazole is thought to act as a functional agonist in the mesocortical pathway, where reduced dopamine activity is seen in association with negative symptoms and cognitive impairment [A34403]. Antagonism at 5-HT2A receptors by aripiprazole alleviates the negative symptoms and cognitive impairment of schizophrenia [T28]. 5-HT2A receptors are Gi/Go-coupled that upon activation, produce neuronal inhibition via decreased neuronal excitability and decreased transmitter release at the nerve terminals. In the nigrostriatal pathway, 5-HT2A regulates the release of dopamine. Through antagonism of 5-HT2A receptors, aripiprazole disinhibits the release of dopamine in the striatum and enhance the levels of the transmitters at the nerve terminals [T28]. The combined effects of D2 and 5-HT2A antagonism are thought to counteract the increased dopamine function causing increased extrapyramidal side effects [T28]. Blocking 5-HT2A receptors may also lead to the modulation of glutamate release in the mesocortical circuit, which is a transmitter that plays a role in schizophrenia [A34403]. 5-HT1A receptors are autoreceptors that inhibit 5-HT release upon activation. Aripiprazole is a partial agonist at theses receptors and reduces 5-HT release; this results in potentiated dopamine release in the striatum and prefrontal cortex [T28]. It is reported that therapeutic doses of aripiprazole occupies up to 90% of brain D2 receptors in a dose-dependent manner [A4965].     Apripiprazole targets different receptors that lead to drug-related adverse reactions; for example, the antagonist activity at the alpha-1 adrenergic receptors results in orthostatic hypotension [A34289]. Aripiprazole's antagonism of histamine H1 receptors may explain the somnolence observed with this drug [A34289]."

Mometasone furoate is formulated as a dry powder inhaler, nasal spray, and ointment for its different indications[FDA Label][F4292,F4295].Mometasone is a synthetic corticosteroid with an affinity for glucocorticoid receptors 22 times higher than that of [dexamethasone][A176906]. Mometasone furoate also has a lower affinity to mineralocorticoid receptors than natural corticosteroids, making it more selective in its action[A176906]. Mometasone furoate diffuses across cell membranes to activate pathways responsible for reducing inflammation[FDA Label][A176900,A176906,A176918,F4292,F4295].In asthma, mometasone is believed to inhibit mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, and lymphocytes[A176918]. There is also evidence of inhibition of histamine, leukotrienes, and cytokines[A176918].    Corticosteroids diffuse across cell membranes into the cytosol of cells where they bind to glucocorticoid receptors to produce their activity[A176906]. Mometasone furoate has a particularly high receptor affinity compare to other corticosteroids, 22 times higher than that of [dexamethasone][A176906]. Mometasone furoate binding to a glucocorticoid receptor causes conformational changes in the receptor, separation from chaperones, and the receptor moves to the nucleus[A176918]. Once at the nucleus, receptors dimerize and bind to a DNA sequence known as the glucocorticoid response element which either increases expression of anti-inflammatory molecules or inhibits expression of pro-inflammatory molecules (such as interleukins 4 and 5)[A176918]. Mometasone furoate also reduces inflammation by blocking transcription factors such as activator-protein-1 and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB)[A176906,A176918]."

Also used to treat endocrine (hormonal) disorders (adrenal insufficiency, Addisons disease). It is also used to treat many immune and allergic disorders, such as arthritis, lupus, severe psoriasis, severe asthma, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease.Hydrocortisone is the most important human glucocorticoid. It is essential for life and regulates or supports a variety of important cardiovascular, metabolic, immunologic and homeostatic functions. Topical hydrocortisone is used for its anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive properties to treat inflammation due to corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses. Glucocorticoids are a class of steroid hormones characterised by an ability to bind with the cortisol receptor and trigger a variety of important cardiovascular, metabolic, immunologic and homeostatic effects. Glucocorticoids are distinguished from mineralocorticoids and sex steroids by having different receptors, target cells, and effects. Technically, the term corticosteroid refers to both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, but is often used as a synonym for glucocorticoid. Glucocorticoids suppress cell-mediated immunity. They act by inhibiting genes that code for the cytokines IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha, the most important of which is the IL-2. Reduced cytokine production limits T cell proliferation. Glucocorticoids also suppress humoral immunity, causing B cells to express lower amounts of IL-2 and IL-2 receptors. This diminishes both B cell clonal expansion and antibody synthesis. The diminished amounts of IL-2 also leads to fewer T lymphocyte cells being activated.Hydrocortisone binds to the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor. After binding the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific target genes. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Specifically glucocorticoids induce lipocortin-1 (annexin-1) synthesis, which then binds to cell membranes preventing the phospholipase A2 from coming into contact with its substrate arachidonic acid. This leads to diminished eicosanoid production. The cyclooxygenase (both COX-1 and COX-2) expression is also suppressed, potentiating the effect. In other words, the two main products in inflammation Prostaglandins and Leukotrienes are inhibited by the action of Glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids also stimulate the lipocortin-1 escaping to the extracellular space, where it binds to the leukocyte membrane receptors and inhibits various inflammatory events: epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, respiratory burst and the release of various inflammatory mediators (lysosomal enzymes, cytokines, tissue plasminogen activator, chemokines etc.) from neutrophils, macrophages and mastocytes. Additionally the immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference with antigen-antibody binding."

They act by inhibiting genes that code for the cytokines IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha, the most important of which is the IL-2. Reduced cytokine production limits T cell proliferation. Glucocorticoids also suppress humoral immunity, causing B cells to express lower amounts of IL-2 and IL-2 receptors. This diminishes both B cell clonal expansion and antibody synthesis. The diminished amounts of IL-2 also leads to fewer T lymphocyte cells being activated.Hydrocortisone binds to the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor. After binding the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific target genes. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Specifically glucocorticoids induce lipocortin-1 (annexin-1) synthesis, which then binds to cell membranes preventing the phospholipase A2 from coming into contact with its substrate arachidonic acid. This leads to diminished eicosanoid production. The cyclooxygenase (both COX-1 and COX-2) expression is also suppressed, potentiating the effect. In other words, the two main products in inflammation Prostaglandins and Leukotrienes are inhibited by the action of Glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids also stimulate the lipocortin-1 escaping to the extracellular space, where it binds to the leukocyte membrane receptors and inhibits various inflammatory events: epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, respiratory burst and the release of various inflammatory mediators (lysosomal enzymes, cytokines, tissue plasminogen activator, chemokines etc.) from neutrophils, macrophages and mastocytes. Additionally the immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference with antigen-antibody binding."

1615,"Tedizolid is indicated for the treatment of acute bacterial infections of the skin and skin structure (ABSSSI). To prevent drug resistance, tedizolid should only be used for infections that are caused by susceptible bacteria.[L11232]Drug-resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_, vancomycin-resistant _Enterococcus faecium_, and penicillin-resistant _Streptococcus penumoniae_, represent a massive public health threat.[A199086, A199131] Tedizolid is a member of the oxazolidinone class of antibiotics, which includes the previously approved [linezolid] and is generally effective against multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria. Tedizolid is indicated for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) and is generally more effective and more tolerable than [linezolid].[L11232, A199086, A199050]    Tedizolid was approved by the FDA on June 20, 2014, for sale by Cubist Pharmaceuticals as tedizolid phosphate (SIVEXTRO®). This product is currently available as both an oral tablet and as a powder for intravenous injection.[L11232]Tedizolid is an oxazolidinone antibiotic that works by inhibiting protein synthesis by bacterial ribosomes.[L11232, A199077, A199086] However, oxazolidinone antibiotics can also bind to human mitochondrial, but not cytoplasmic, ribosomes.[A199080, A199092] Mitochondrial protein synthesis inhibition is associated with adverse patient effects such as neurological, hematological, and gastrointestinal toxicity, although tedizolid is tolerated better than the related [linezolid].[A199050] Alternative therapies should be considered when treating neutropenic patients with ABSSSI. _Clostridium difficile_-associated diarrhea has been reported in patients treated with tedizolid.[L11232]Despite renewed efforts to combat the spread of antimicrobial resistance, multidrug-resistant organisms, including gram-positive bacteria such as methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_, remain a threat.[A199131, A199086] Oxazolidinones represent a relatively new class of antibacterials inhibiting protein synthesis that is generally capable of overcoming resistance to other bacterial protein synthesis inhibitors.[L11232, A199086, A199089]    Protein synthesis involves the action of ribosomes, multi-subunit complexes composed of both protein and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) substituents. Translocation along the length of a messenger RNA and concomitant protein synthesis involves the action of the A, P, and E sites of the peptidyltransferase centre (PTC), which accepts charged aminoacyl-tRNAs and catalyzes the formation of peptide bonds between them. The bacterial 70S ribosome comprises a small (30S) and a large (50S) subunit.[A199134]    Early studies into the mechanism of action of oxazolidinone antibiotics suggested that they inhibit a step in the initiation of protein synthesis.[A199083] However, this mechanism was inconsistent with mapped resistance mutations, and later studies involving cross-linking and direct structural determination of the binding site revealed that oxazolidinones, including both [linezolid] and tedizolid, bind in the A site of the PTC by interacting with the 23S rRNA component.[A199080, A199077] The structural studies also revealed that oxazolidinone binding alters the conformation of a conserved nucleotide in the 23S rRNA (U2585 in _Escherichia coli_), which renders the PTC non-productive for peptide bond formation.[A199077] Hence, tedizolid exerts its effect through inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis.[L11232]"

1626,"Vibegron is indicated for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB) with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency in adults.[L28305]Vibegron is a potent, selective beta-3 adrenergic receptor (β3) agonist that relaxes the detrusor smooth muscle of the bladder, thereby increasing bladder capacity.[L28305] Vibegron was first approved in Japan in September 2018 for the treatment of overactive bladder,[A226050] a condition associated with distressing symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency, and reduced quality of life of patients. On December 23, 2020, vibegron was approved for the same indication in adults. It is available as oral tablets under the market name GEMTESA.[L28310]     Vibegron is the second beta-3 adrenergic agonist approved for the treatment of overactive bladder following [mirabegron], which was approved in 2012. Unlike mirabegron, vibegron is less likely to be associated with drug-drug interactions involving the CYP3A4, 2D6, or 2C9 enzymes.[A226065]Vibegron selectivity for beta-3 adrenergic receptors is >9000 times higher than for β1AR or β2AR.[A226065] Vibegron improves clinical symptoms of overactive bladder by increasing bladder capacity without affecting bladder contraction.[A226060] It significantly increases the functional bladder volume in a dose-dependent manner, which results in prolongation of the interval between voids. In clinical studies, vibegron inhibited detrusor bladder contractions in a concentration-dependent manner, reduced voiding pressure, and increased bladder compliance.[A226065] In Japanese clinical studies comprising patients with overactive bladder, vibegron significantly improved the frequency of micturition, urgency, and urgency incontinence episodes.[A226055,A226065]Overactive bladder is characterized by symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency. Bladder filling and emptying are regulated by the coordinated communication between sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. Bladder filling occurs via parasympathetic inhibition and the sympathetic hypogastric nerve releasing norepinephrine, which acts on beta-adrenergic receptors responsible for mediating detrusor muscle relaxation.[A226060, A226080] Symptoms of overactive bladder are thought to be caused by the deterioration of the sensory connections between the bladder, spinal cord and brain, leading to changes in the lower urinary tract and abnormal bladder sensations of the urge to void at small bladder volumes.[A226065]    Beta-3 adrenergic receptors (β3ARs) are expressed in the kidneys and lower urinary tract, including ureters, urethra, prostate, and bladder. Vibegron is a selective agonist at β3AR. One vibegron binds to the receptor, β3AR is stimulated and undergoes a conformation change and activates adenylyl cyclases (AC), which promotes the formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Increased intracellular cAMP concentration leads to the activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), which subsequently phosphorylates myosin light chains that are responsible for inhibiting the interaction of actin with myosin dependent on calcium – calmodulin complex.[A226065,A226080] In clinical trials, vibegron increased cAMP levels in a dose-proportional manner. There is evidence that β3AR agonists may also work via sensory mechanisms without directly affecting detrusor muscle motor function.[A226065]"

1628,"Imlifidase is indicated for desensitization of highly sensitized adult kidney transplant patients with a positive crossmatch against an available deceased donor.[L28001] The treatment is reserved for patients unlikely to receive a transplant under the available kidney allocation system including prioritization programs for highly sensitized patients.[L28001]Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive and irreversible disease that represents a significant burden for both the individual and healthcare system at large.[A225916] Currently available treatments for end-stage renal disease are limited to dialysis and renal transplantation, with the former associated with significant costs and lower quality of life.[A225836,A225916]      Patients who have developed human leukocyte antigen (HLA) sensitization from prior exposure to blood products, pregnancy, or any other circumstance which may have resulted in exposure to non-self HLA antigens, face additional barriers to transplantation.[A225836,A225921] Highly sensitized individuals carry high levels of anti-HLA antibodies and are at significant risk for antibody-mediated rejection which occurs mainly through complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).[A225836] High levels of anti-HLA antibodies also contribute to poor graft survival.[A225836] As a result, highly sensitized individuals experience marked delays on transplant lists due to the challenges associated with procuring an HLA compatible donor graft.[A225836,A225921]    Imlifidase is a cysteine protease and eliminates Fc-dependent effector functions such as CDC and ADCC by cleaving the heavy chains of human immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies.[L28001] As a result, the risk of antibody-mediated rejection is reduced allowing kidney transplantation in highly sensitized patients to proceed.[A225836,L28001]Imlifidase is highly specific to all four human IgG subclasses and does not cleave any other immunoglobulins (IgM, IgA, IgE, IgD).[A225836,L28041] The inactivation of human IgG antibodies occurs rapidly and efficiently after administration of imlifidase, with the effect lasting for several weeks.[A226045]Imlifidase is a cysteine protease derived from _Streptococcus pyogenes_ which degrades immunoglobulin G (IgG) in a multistep process.[A226040,L28001] In the first step, imlifidase cleaves one of the two IgG heavy chains at the lower hinge leaving the other intact, resulting in a single cleaved IgG molecule. In the second step, the second heavy chain is cleaved yielding one homodimeric Fc fragment and one F(ab’)2 fragment.[A226040,A226045,L28001]     This process removes the ability of the F(ab’)2 fragments to participate in Fc-mediated functions including antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).[L28001,L28041] Ultimately, by degrading the entire IgG pool, imlifidase reduces donor-specific antibodies (DSA) and allows transplantation to occur.[A225836,L28001]"
1629,"Vericiguat is indicated in adults with symptomatic, chronic heart failure and an ejection fraction of <45% to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and heart failure-related hospitalization following a hospitalization for heart failure or need for outpatient intravenous diuretics.[L31153]Vericiguat is a direct stimulator of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) used in the management of systolic heart failure to reduce mortality and hospitalizations.[L31153] A key component of the NO-sGC-cGMP signaling pathway that helps to regulate the cardiovascular system, sGC enzymes are intracellular enzymes found in vascular smooth muscle cells (amongst other cell types) that catalyze the synthesis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in response to activation by nitric oxide (NO).[A227458,A227488] Cyclic GMP acts as a second messenger, activating a number of downstream signaling cascades that elicit a broad variety of effects, and these diverse cellular effects have implicated deficiencies in its production (primarily due to insufficient NO bioavailability) in the pathogenesis of various cardiovascular diseases.[A227458] As a direct stimulator of sGC, vericiguat mitigates the need for a functional NO-sGC-cGMP axis and thereby helps to prevent the myocardial and vascular dysfunction associated with decreased sGC activity in heart failure.[L31178]    Vericiguat was approved by the FDA in January 2021 - developed by Merck under the brand name Verquvo - for use in certain patients with systolic heart failure.[L31178] Although not the first sGC stimulator to be granted FDA approval ([riociguat] was approved in 2013 for use in pulmonary hypertension),[L3955] vericiguat is unique amongst its peers in that modifications to its structure have dramatically decreased its susceptibility to oxidative metabolism,[A227458] resulting in a relatively long half-life and allowing for once-daily dosing.By directly stimulating the increased production of intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), vericiguat causes the relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and vasodilation.[L31153] Vericiguat has a relatively long half-life (~30h) that allows for once-daily dosing.[L31153]    Animal reproduction studies have demonstrated the potential for embryo-fetal toxicity when vericiguat is administered to pregnant females - defects in major vessel and heart formation, as well as spontaneous abortions/resorptions, were observed when vericiguat was administered to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis.[L31153] The possibility of pregnancy should be excluded prior to beginning therapy with vericiguat, and adequate contraception should be used throughout therapy and for one month following cessation of treatment.[L31153]Heart failure (HF) involves, amongst other morphologic and physiologic changes, the impaired synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) and decreased activity of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC). Functioning normally, NO binds to sGC and stimulates the synthesis of intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP),[A227488] a second messenger involved in the maintenance of vascular tone, as well as cardiac contractility and remodeling. Defects in this pathway are thought to contribute to the myocardial and vascular dysfunction associated with heart failure and are therefore a desirable target in its treatment.[L31153,A227458]    Vericiguat directly stimulates sGC by binding to a target site on its beta-subunit,[A227488] bypassing the need for NO-mediated activation, and in doing so causes an increase in the production of intracellular cGMP that results in vascular smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation.[L31153]"
1630,"Sotorasib is indicated in the treatment of KRAS G12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in adults who have received at least one prior systemic therapy.[L34288]Sotorasib, also known as AMG-510, is an acrylamide-derived KRAS inhibitor developed by Amgen.[A187547,A187556] It is indicated in the treatment of adult patients with KRAS G12C mutant non-small cell lung cancer.[L34288] This mutation makes up >50% of all KRAS mutations.[A187550] Mutant KRAS discovered in 1982 but was not considered a druggable target until the mid-2010s.[A235168] It is the first experimental KRAS inhibitor.[A187547] The drug [MRTX849] is also currently being developed and has the same target.[A187547]    Sotorasib was granted FDA approval on May 28, 2021,[L34288] followed by the European Commission's approval on January 10, 2022.[L39675]Sotorasib is indicated in the treatment of adults with KRAS G12C mutant non small cell lung cancer.[L34288] It has a moderate duration of action as it is given daily.[L34288] Patients should be counselled regarding the risks of hepatotoxicity, interstitial lung disease and pneumonitis; and to avoid breastfeeding during treatment and up to 1 week after the last dose.[L34288]Normally GTP binds to KRAS, activating the protein and promoting effectors to the MAP kinase pathway.[A187556] GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP, and KRAS is inactivated.[A187559] KRAS G12C mutations impair hydrolysis of GTP, leaving it in the active form.[A187559]    Sotorasib binds to the cysteine residue in KRAS G12C mutations, holding the protein in its inactive form.[A187547] The cysteine residue that sotorasib targets is not present in the wild type KRAS, which prevents off-target effects.[L34288] This mutation is present in 13% of non small cell lung cancer, 3% of colorectal and appendix cancer, and 1-3% of solid tumors.[A187547]"
1631,"Pegcetacoplan is indicated to treat adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).[L34095] It is also indicated to treat geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration.[L45354]Pegcetacoplan is a complement inhibitor indicated in the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).[A235000,L34095] Prior to its FDA approval, patients with PNH were typically treated with the C5 inhibiting monoclonal antibody [eculizumab].[A235000] Patients given eculizumab experienced less hemolysis caused by the membrane attack complex, but were still somewhat susceptible to hemolysis caused by C3b opsonization.[A235000,A235005] Pegcetacoplan was developed out of a need for an inhibitor of complement mediated hemolysis further upstream of C5.[A235000,A235005] Pegcetacoplan is a pegylated C3 inhibitor that can disrupt the processes leading to both forms of hemolysis that threaten patients with PNH.[A235000]    Pegcetacoplan for subcutaneous use was granted FDA approval on 14 May 2021.[L34095] In February 2023, pegcetacoplan for intravitreal use was approved by the FDA for the treatment of geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration.[L45354]Pegcetacoplan is a complement C3 inhibitor that prevents complement-mediated hemolysis of red blood cells in patients with paroxysomal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.[L34095] It has a long duration of action as it is administered twice weekly.[L34095] Patients should be vaccinated against encapsulated bacteria according to the most recent recommendations.[L34095]PNH is due to a mutation in the phosphatidylinositol N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase subunit A (PIGA) gene.[A234975,A235000] The mutation in the PIGA gene prevents an early step in the formation of glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol (GPI).[A234975] Under normal circumstances, GPI connects cell surface proteins to the cell.[A234975,A235000] In patients with PNH, complement inhibiting cell surface proteins, such as CD55 and CD59, are not anchored to the surface of red blood cells.[A234975,A235000] In cases with reduced or absent CD55 and CD59, complement is not appropriately inhibited, leading to activation of the complement system and complement-mediated hemolysis.[A234975,A235000] As a result of complement-mediated hemolysis, patients with PNH may experience anemia, fatigue, asthenia, and dyspnea.[A235000]    The alternative complement system pathway is spontaneously activated due to the absence of CD55, leading to activation of a C3 convertase that that cleaves C3 into C3a and C3b.[A234975] C3b binds to factor B, which is cleaved by factor D into the smaller Ba and larger Bb.[A234980] The resulting C3bBb can bind to other C3 proteins, leading to a positive feedback loop of complement activation.[A234980] C3b proteins can also bind directly to a target cell, marking it as a target for phagocytosis.[A234995] CD55, also known as decay-accelerating factor (DAF) disrupts the formation of C3bBb, preventing spontaneous activation of the alternative complement pathway.[A234980]    C3b cleaves C5 into C5a and C5b.[A234975] C5b combines with complement proteins C6, C7, C8, and C9 to form the membrane attack complex (MAC).[A234980] The MAC is a pore formed in the cell by 16 C9 proteins associated with C5b, C6, C7, and C8.[A234990] Formation of pores destroys the cell membrane leading to cell death.[A234990] CD59 disrupts the formation of the MAC, preventing hemolysis.[A234975]    In patients with PNH, extravascular hemolysis is mediated by C3b marking red blood cells for phagocytosis, and intravascular hemolysis is mediated by the MAC.[A235000,L34095] Pegcetacoplan binds to C3 and C3b, reducing cleavage and activation of complement pathways, reducing both extravascular and intravascular hemolysis.[L34095]"
1632,"Belumosudil is indicated for the treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older following failure of at least two other lines of systemic therapy.[L34749]Belumosudil is used in the treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and has been investigated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension.[A236634] It is an inhibitor of rho-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinases (ROCK), with significantly more selectivity for ROCK2 as compared to ROCK1 (IC50 100 nM vs. 3 μM, respectively).[L34749] In the treatment of GVHD, a condition in which donor T-cells begin to attack recipient tissues following allogeneic hematopoeitic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), belumosudil helps to resolve immune dysregulation by shifting the balance between Th17 cells and T-regulatory cells, thereby dampening the inflammatory cascade that can occasionally be fatal.[A236644,L34759]    Belumosudil was first approved by the FDA in July 2021, under the brand name Rezurock, for the treatment of chronic GVHD in patients who have tried and failed at least two prior lines of systemic therapy.[L34754] In July 2022, Belumosudil was approved by Health Canada under the brand name RHOLISTIQ to treat the same condition in adult and pediatric patients 12 years or older.[L42925]Belumosudil appears to inhibit several pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory processes in order to prevent and treat the damage incurred by graft-versus-host disease. Given its mechanism of action and findings in animal trials, belumosudil is considered to carry embryo-fetal toxicity and may cause significant harm to a developing fetus should a pregnant mother be exposed.[L34749] Female patients of reproductive potential, or male patients with female partners of reproductive potential, should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment with belumosudil and for one week after the last dose.[L34749]Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a life-threatening complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in which the transplanted donor T-cells recognize the recipient's tissues as foreign and mount an immune response.[A236639] During the conditioning regimen prior to stem cell transplantation (e.g. involving irradiation or chemotherapy) the host tissues can become damaged which results in downstream inflammatory responses and the generation of inflammatory mediators like TNF-alpha and IL-1. These cytokines increase the expression of host major histocompatibility (MHC) antigens and adhesion molecules which enhances the ability of mature donor T-cells to recognize these molecules. The activation of these donor T-cells results in the activation of mononuclear phagocytes, whose effector functions are triggered by stimulatory molecules generated by the damage incurred during the conditioning phase of treatment. Activated macrophages and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes begin to directly lyse target cells and/or cause their apoptosis, which eventually leads to local tissue damage and further inflammatory responses.[A236644]    Belumosudil is an inhibitor of Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase 2 (ROCK2), a protein that plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of immune and fibrotic diseases. The inhibition of ROCK2 has been shown to resolve immune dysregulation by down-regulating pro-inflammatory Th17 cells and up-regulating regulatory T-cells by manipulating the phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT5.[L34749,L34759]"
