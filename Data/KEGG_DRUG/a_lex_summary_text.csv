0,"Lepirudin is also indicated for anticoagulation in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and associated thromboembolic disease in order to prevent further thromboembolic complications.Lepirudin is a recombinant hirudin formed by 65 amino acids that acts as a highly specific and direct thrombin inhibitor. A single molecule of lepirudin binds to a molecule of thrombin, blocking its thrombogenic activity. The concomitant use of thrombolytic therapy and lepirudin is not recommended due to the high risk of bleeding that may be life-threatening. Patients with renal impairment have a higher risk of hemorrhagic adverse events.Lepirudin is a direct thrombin inhibitor used as an anticoagulant in patients for whom heparin is contraindicated. This blocks the protease activity of thrombin and inhibits the coagulation process."
1,"Cetuximab is also indicated for K-Ras wild-type, EGFR-expressing;    Cetuximab is not indicated for the treatment of Ras-mutant colorectal cancer or when the results of the Ras mutation tests are unknown.Cetuximab is a recombinant chimeric human/mouse IgG1 monoclonal antibody that competitively binds to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and competitively inhibits the binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF). _In vitro_, cetuximab was shown to mediate anti-tumour effects in numerous cancer cell lines and human tumour xenografts. It has also been investigated in advanced colorectal cancer, EGFR-expressing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and unresectable squamous cell skin cancer.Cetuximab is an anticancer agent that works by inhibiting the growth and survival of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-expressing tumour cells with high specificity and higher affinity than epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-α), which are natural ligands of EGFR. It has been investigated as a therapeutic target for anticancer treatment, as it is often upregulated in cancer types, including head and neck, colon, and rectal cancers. Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the EGFR on both normal and tumour cells to competitively inhibit the binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and other ligands that are produced by normal and tumour tissue epithelial cells."
2,"It is also used to manage signs and symptoms of polyarticular idiopathic arthritis and Juvenile Psoriatic Arthritis in those aged 2 years and older. The Fc component of etanercept contains the CH2 domain, the CH3 domain and hinge region, but not the CH1 domain of IgG1. It is used to treat or manage a variety of inflammatory conditions including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and juvenile idiopathic poly-articular arthritis (JIA).Etanercept binds specifically to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and thereby modulates biological processes that are induced or regulated by TNF. Such processes or molecules affected include the level of adhesion molecules expressed, as well as serum levels of cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases.There are two distinct receptors for TNF (TNFRs), a 55 kilodalton protein (p55) and a 75 kilodalton protein (p75). Increased levels of TNF are found in tissues and fluids of those with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and plaque psoriasis."
3,"For treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and for the prevention of thrombosis. Bivalirudin is indicated for use in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), in patients at moderate to high risk acute coronary syndromes due to unstable angina or non-ST segment elevation in whom a PCI is planned.Bivalirudin is a synthetic 20 residue peptide (thrombin inhibitor) which reversibly inhibits thrombin. Once bound to the active site, thrombin cannot activate fibrinogen into fibrin, the crucial step in the formation of thrombus. Because it can cause blood stagnation, it is important to monitor changes in hematocrit, activated partial thromboplastin time, international normalized ratio and blood pressure.Bivalirudin mediates an inhibitory action on thrombin by directly and specifically binding to both the catalytic site and anion-binding exosite of circulating and clot-bound thrombin. The action of bivalirudin is reversible because thrombin will slowly cleave the thrombin-bivalirudin bond which recovers the active site of thrombin."
4,"It is also used for the treatment of pediatric patients with central precocious puberty (CPP).leuprolide is also indicated for the initial treatment of the symptoms of endometriosis.Leuprolide is a synthetic 9-residue peptide analogue of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). As a GnRH mimic, leuprolide is capable of binding to the GnRH receptor (GnRHR) and inducing downstream modulation of both gonadotropin hormone and sex steroid levels. Prolonged activation of GnRHR results in significant downregulation of sex steroid levels, which is primarily responsible for the clinical efficacy of leuprolide in diverse conditions, including advanced prostate cancer, endometriosis, and central precocious puberty. Leuprolide remains frontline therapy in all conditions for which it is indicated for use.Leuprolide is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue that functions as a GnRH receptor superagonist. As a GnRHR agonist, leuprolide binds to and initially activates downstream LH and FSH release; this initial spike in gonadotropin levels is responsible for some of the adverse effects associated with treatment."
5,"Alteplase is indicated for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and for use in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) for the reduction of mortality and incidence of heart failure. It was first approved by the FDA in 1987 for the management of thromboembolic disease, including acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Alteplase specificity for fibrin is achieved thanks to its high affinity for lysine residues. In the absence of fibrin, alteplase converts a limited amount of plasminogen. However, in the presence of fibrin clots, alteplase binds to fibrin and cleaves the arginine-valine bond at positions 560 and 561 of plasminogen, converting it into its active form, plasmin."
6,"Goserelin is indicated for:    - Use in combination with flutamide for the management of locally confined carcinoma of the prostate  - Palliative treatment of advanced carcinoma of the prostate  - The management of endometriosis  - Use as an endometrial-thinning agent prior to endometrial ablation for dysfunctional uterine bleeding  - Use in the palliative treatment of advanced breast cancer in pre- and perimenopausal womenGoserelin is a synthetic hormone. In men, it stops the production of the hormone testosterone, which may stimulate the growth of cancer cells. In women, goserelin decreases the production of the hormone estradiol (which may stimulate the growth of cancer cells) to levels similar to a postmenopausal state. When the medication is stopped, hormone levels return to normal.The pharmacokinetics of goserelin have been determined in both male and female healthy volunteers and patients. In these studies, goserelin was administered as a single 250µg (aqueous solution) dose and as a single or multiple 3.6 mg depot dose by subcutaneous route.Goserelin is a synthetic decapeptide analogue of LHRH."
7,"Used in the treatment of symptomatic Paget's disease for patients unresponsive to alternate treatments or intolerant to such treatments. In addition, it is used in emergency situations when serum calcium levels must be decreased quickly until the underlying condition is identified. It can also be added to existing therapeutic regimens for hypercalcemia such as intravenous fluids and furosemide, oral phosphate or corticosteroids, or other agents. Synthetic peptide, 32 residues long formulated as a nasal spray.Calcitonin inhibits bone resorption by osteoclasts (bone remodeling cells) and promotes bone formation by osteoblasts. In consequence, there is an increase in the jejunal secretion of water, sodium, potassium, and chloride.Calcitonin binds to the calcitonin receptor (found primarily in osteoclasts) which then enhances the production of vitamin D producing enzymes (25-hydroxyvitamine D-24-hydroxylase), leading to greater calcium retention and enhanced bone density."
8,"Anakinra is also indicated for the treatment of Neonatal-Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (NOMID) and the treatment of Deficiency of Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist (DIRA). Since anakinra is approved for this condition under EUA, the drug should only be used when there are no alternative treatment available.Anakinra is a recombinant human interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) composed of 153 amino acid residues. On November 8, 2022, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) of anakinra for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients who are at risk of progressing to severe respiratory failure.Anakinra is a recombinant human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) that blocks the biologic activity of interleukin-1 (IL-1) by competitively inhibiting its ability to bind to the IL-1 type I receptor (IL-1RI). Anakinra can also be used in the treatment of neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID) and deficiency of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA). Patients with NOMID have spontaneous mutations in CIAS1/NLRP3, a gene that encodes cryopyrin, an inflammasome component."
9,"Typically prescribed for the management of diabetes mellitus, insulin is a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas that promotes glucose metabolism. Insulin is an important treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce or synthesize the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels. Insulin is also used in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), another form of diabetes mellitus that is a slowly progressing metabolic disorder caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors that promote chronically elevated blood sugar levels. Human insulin is also available in an intermediate-acting form as NPH (Neutral Protamine Hagedorn) as the marketed products Novolin N and Humulin N. NPH insulin is provided as a crystalline suspension of insulin with protamine and zinc, resulting in an onset of action in 1 to 3 hours, duration of action up to 24 hours, and peak action from 6 to 8 hours. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC) which play a critical role in metabolism and catabolism."
10,"For treatment of myocardial infarction and lysis of intracoronary emboliTenecteplase is a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) developed from modifications of natural human tPA complementary DNA (cDNA). It is a 527 amino acid with a substitution of threonine 103 with asparagine and substitution of asparagine 117 with glutamine within the kringle 1 domain, and a tetra-alanine substitution at amino acids 296-299 in the protease domain.Tenecteplase is a fibrin-specific tissue-plasminogen activator. It binds to fibrin rich clots and cleaves the Arg/Val bond in plasminogen to form plasmin. Plasmin in turn degrades the fibrin matrix of the thrombus, thereby exerting its thrombolytic action. Plasmin in turn degrades the fibrin matrix of the thrombus, thereby exerting its thrombolytic action."
11,"- Indicated for patients with hemophilia A with factor VIII coagulant activity levels greater than 5% or mild to moderate classic von Willebrand's Disease (Type I) with factor VIII levels greater than 5% during surgical procedures and postoperatively to maintain hemostasis (parenteral).Desmopressin (dDAVP), a synthetic analogue of 8-arginine vasopressin (ADH), is an antidiuretic peptide drug modified by deamination of 1-cysteine and substitution of 8-L-arginine by 8-D-arginine. Desmopressin is indicated for the treatment of polyuric conditions including primary nocturnal enuresis, nocturia, and diabetes insipidus. Nocdurna, or desmopressin acetate, was approved by the FDA on June 21st, 2018 for the treatment of nocturia due to nocturnal polyuria in adults. It is available as a sublingual tablet.By mimicking the actions of endogenous ADH, desmopressin acts as a selective agonist of V2 receptors expressed in the renal collecting duct (CD) to increase water re-absorption and reduce urine production. Desmopressin administered intranasally has an antidiuretic effect about one-tenth that of an equivalent dose administered by injection .Upon binding of desmopressin to V2 receptors in the basolateral membrane of the cells of the distal tubule and collecting ducts of the nephron, adenylyl cyclase is stimulated."
12,"For treatment of hemorrhagic complications in hemophilia A and B.Recombinant human coagulation Factor VIIa (rFVIIa), intended for promoting hemostasis by activating the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade. NovoSeven is a vitamin K-dependent glycoprotein consisting of 406 amino acid residues. Cloned and expressed in hamster kidney cells, the protein is catalytically active in a two-chain form.Used in the treatment of bleeding episodes in hemophilia A or B. NovoSeven is recombinant Factor VIIa and, when complexed with tissue factor can activate coagulation Factor X to Factor Xa, as well as coagulation Factor IX to Factor IXa. Factor Xa, in complex with other factors, then converts prothrombin to thrombin, which leads to the formation of a hemostatic plug by converting fibrinogen to fibrin and thereby inducing local clotting.NovoSeven activates the coagulation or clotting cascade by cleaving Factor IX and Factor X, which activates them and then leads to activation of thrombin and fibrin."
13,"Glucagon is indicated as a diagnostic aid in radiologic exams to temporarily inhibit the movement of the gastrointestinal tract and to treat severe hypoglycemia.Glucagon is a 29 amino acid hormone used as a diagnostic aid in radiologic exams to temporarily inhibit the movement of the gastrointestinal tract and to treat severe hypoglycemia. Glucagon raises blood sugar through activation of hepatic glucagon receptors, stimulating glycogenolysis and the release of glucose. Glucagon was granted FDA approval on 14 November 1960.Glucagon is indicated as a diagnostic aid in radiologic exams to temporarily inhibit the movement of the gastrointestinal tract and severe hypoglycemia. Glucagon raises blood sugar through activation of hepatic glucagon receptors, stimulating glycogenolysis and the release of glucose. Glucagon has a short duration of action."
14,"For the treatment of patients with cervical dystonia to reduce the severity of abnormal head position and neck pain associated with cervical dystonia.Neurotoxin produced by fermentation of clostridium botulinum type B. The protein exists in noncovalent association with hemagglutinin and nonhemagglutinin proteins as a neurotoxin complex. The neurotoxin complex is recovered from the fermentation process and purified through a series of precipitation and chromatography steps.Botulinum Toxin Type B inhibits acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction via a three stage process: 1) Heavy Chain mediated neurospecific binding of the toxin, 2) internalization of the toxin by receptor-mediated endocytosis, and 3) ATP and pH dependent translocation of the Light Chain to the neuronal cytosol where it acts as a zinc-dependent endoprotease cleaving polypeptides essential for neurotransmitter release.Botulinum Toxin Type B binds to and cleaves the synaptic Vesicle Associated Membrane Protein (VAMP, also known as synaptobrevin) which is a component of the protein complex responsible for docking and fusion of the synaptic vesicle to the presynaptic membrane, a necessary step to neurotransmitter release."
15,"Insulin is prescribed for the management of diabetes mellitus to mimic the activity of endogenously produced human insulin, a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas that promotes glucose metabolism. Insulin is released from the pancreas following a meal to promote the uptake of glucose from the blood into internal organs and tissues such as the liver, fat cells, and skeletal muscle. Insulin is an important treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels. Due to its duration of action of around 5 hours, Humalog is considered ""bolus insulin"" as it provides high levels of insulin in a short period of time to mimic the release of endogenous insulin from the pancreas after meals. Its activity peaks 60 minutes following subcutaneous injection and its duration of action is 4-5 hours."
16,"Insulin is typically prescribed for the management of diabetes mellitus to mimic the activity of endogenously produced human insulin, a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas that promotes glucose metabolism. Insulin is released from the pancreas following a meal to promote the uptake of glucose from the blood into internal organs and tissues such as the liver, fat cells, and skeletal muscle. Insulin is an important treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce or synthesize the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels. Available as the brand name product Lantus, insulin glargine has a duration of action up to 24 hours allowing for once-daily dosing, typically at bedtime. The resulting protein is soluble at pH 4 and forms microprecipitates at physiological pH 7.4 allowing for the slow release of small amounts of insulin glargine, giving the drug a long duration of action and no pronounced peak concentration."
17,"For treatment of hyperuricemia, reduces elevated plasma uric acid levels (from chemotherapy)Rasburicase is a recombinant urate-oxidase enzyme produced by a genetically modified <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> strain. The cDNA coding for rasburicase was cloned from a strain of _Aspergillus flavus_.Drugs used to treat lympohoid leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and acute myelogenous leukemia often lead to the accumulation of toxic plasma levels of purine metabolites (i.e. uric acid). The injection of rasburicase reduces levels of uric acid and mitigates the toxic effects of chemotherapy induced tumor lysis.Rasburicase catalyzes enzymatic oxidation of uric acid into an inactive and soluble metabolite (allantoin)."
18,"Abciximab is indicated as an adjunct to percutaneous coronary intervention for the prevention of cardiac ischemic complications in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention and in patients with unstable angina not responding to conventional medical therapy when percutaneous coronary intervention is planned within 24 hours. Abciximab is intended for use with aspirin and heparin and has been studied only in that setting.Abciximab is a Fab fragment of the chimeric human-murine monoclonal antibody 7E3. After two hours post-injection with a dose of 0.25 - 0.30 mg/kg, 80% of the GPIIb/IIIa receptors were blocked and platelet aggregation was prevented. Abciximab binds to the intact platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptor, which is a member of the integrin family of adhesion receptors and the major platelet surface receptor involved in platelet aggregation. By binding to the vitronectin receptor (also known as the αvβ3 integrin), abciximab blocks effects mediated by this integrin which include cell adhesion."
19,"Vasopressin is indicated to increase blood pressure in adults in vasodilatory shock refractory to the application of fluids and catecholamines.Vasopressin (arginine-vasopressin or antidiuretic hormone) is a nonapeptide primarily produced in the hypothalamus that exhibits diverse physiological functions related to diuresis, hemodynamic modulation, and behaviour. Vasopressin release is mediated by sensory pathways, in which either a 2% increase in plasma osmolarity or a 10% decrease in blood pressure causes the release of endogenous vasopressin. Vasopressin binding to V1causes hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate into inositol triphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) and diacylglycerol (DAG) by phospholipase C, which in turn release intracellular calcium and activate protein kinase C (PKC) to open voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) while closing potassium channels. It is also thought that vasopressin, acting through both V1 and oxytocin receptors, causes the cardiac release of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), which has a negative inotropic effect; indeed, vasopressin tends to decrease heart rate and cardiac output, although the opposite effect has been noted with low doses. In these cases, vasopressin acts to depolarize hyperpolarized vascular smooth muscle cells, restore sensitivity to catecholamines, and inhibit excessive nitric oxide production, primarily through acting through V1 receptors."
20,"Interferon beta-1b is a drug used for the treatment of relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis. It has been shown to slow the advance of the disease as well as to decrease the frequency of attacks.Human interferon beta (165 residues), cysteine 17 is substituted with serine. Produced in E. coli, no carbohydrates, MW=18.5kDInterferon beta upregulates the expression of MHC I proteins, allowing for increased presentation of peptides derived from viral antigens. This enhances the activation of CD8+ T cells that are the precursors for cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and makes the macrophage a better target for CTL-mediated killing. Type I interferons also induce the synthesis of several key antiviral mediators including 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase (2'-5' A synthetase), beta-2 microglobulin, neopterin and protein kinase R.Interferon beta binds to type I interferon receptors (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2c) which activate two Jak (Janus kinase) tyrosine kinases (Jak1 and Tyk2)."
21,"Trastuzumab is indicated for subcutaneous administration - in combination with either  or both hyaluronidase and  - for the treatment of adults with HER2-positive breast cancers.Produced in CHO cell cultures, trastuzumab is a recombinant IgG1 kappa, humanized monoclonal antibody  that selectively binds with high affinity in a cell-based assay (Kd = 5 nM) to the extracellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor protein (HER2). It is used as a treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-2+ metastatic breast cancer, where there is a proven amplification of the HER-2 oncogene or over-expression of the HER-2 protein in tumours. In December 2017, FDA approved OGIVRI (trastuzumab-dkst) as a biosimilar to Herceptin (trastuzumab) for the treatment of patients with breast or metastatic stomach cancer (gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma) whose tumors overexpress the HER2 gene (HER2+). While Ogivri is the first biosimilar approved in the U.S. for the treatment of breast cancer or stomach cancer, it is the second biosimilar approved in the U.S. for the treatment of cancer. Further downstream molecular signaling cascades are activated, such as the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt, and the phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ)/protein kinase C (PKC) pathways that promote cell growth and survival and cell cycle progression ."
22,"For treatment of organ transplant recipients, prevention of organ rejectionMurine monoclonal antibody specific to CD3 T-cell lymphocyte antigens. More specifically it is a purified murine (mouse) monoclonal antibody, directed against the CD3 (T3) receptor on the surface of human T-cells (T-lymphocytes) cultured using the murine ascites method. Muromonab is 93% monomeric immune globulin G type 2a (IgG2a).Used in organ transplant prophylaxis, Muromonab or OKT-3 binds specifically to the CD-3 complex, which is involved in antigen recognition and cell stimulation, on the surface of T lymphocytes. Immediately after administration CD-3-positive T lymphocytes are abruptly removed from circulation. It appears to kill CD-3 positive cells by inducing Fc mediated apoptosis, antibody mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity."
23,"Patients should be monitored for CPK levels and, in those with renal impairment, renal function, at least once per week and should consider temporarily suspending the use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. aureus_ bacteremia and endocarditis should be investigated for sequestered foci of infection and the possibility of daptomycin resistance; the dose or treatment regimen may require adjusting. However, no convincing evidence has been presented for any of these models, and an effect on LTA biosynthesis has been ruled out by other studies in _S. Although this lead some to suggest that daptomycin could bind PG to form oligomeric pores in the bacterial membrane, no cell lysis was observed in _S. aureus_, _cls_ in various enterococci, and _pgsA_, PG synthase, and the _dlt_ operon in _E."
24,"Botulinum toxin A is indicated for a variety of conditions, depending on the preparations. A popular use for Botox is the treatment of facial wrinkles and lines, however, there are many uses for the botulinum toxin A in the treatment of dystonia, incontinence, migraine, blepharospasm, and hyperhidrosis.Botulinum toxin A inhibits the release of acetylcholine, relieving muscle contraction and spasm associated with many conditions, such as incontinence and dystonia. Reinnervation of the muscle may occur, reversing muscle denervation caused by botulinum toxin A.Botulinum toxin is a 150-kDa molecular weight protein consisting of a light chain (50 kDa) and heavy chain (100 kDa) linked by a single disulfide bond. The crystal structure reveals 3 lobes - the light chain, the amino-terminal portion of the heavy chain, and the carboxyl-terminal portion of the heavy chain. The light chain specifically interacts with SNAP-25 in the nerve terminals to block binding of acetylcholine vesicles with the cell membrane."
25,"It is also used to prevent bone marrow transplant rejection. Finally, cyclosporine can be used in patients who have chronic transplant rejection and have received previous immunosuppressive therapy and to prevent or treat graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The ophthalmic solution of cyclosporine is indicated to increase tear production in patients suffering from keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Off-label, cyclosporine is commonly used for the treatment of various autoimmune and inflammatory conditions such as atopic dermatitis, blistering disorders, ulcerative colitis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, uveitis, connective tissue diseases, as well as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.Cyclosporine is a calcineurin inhibitor known for its immunomodulatory properties that prevent organ transplant rejection and treat various inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. This complex subsequently inhibits calcineurin, which in turn stops the dephosphorylation as well as the activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) that normally cause inflammatory reactions."
26,"Octreotide by injection is used for the treatment of acromegaly and the reduction of flushing and diarrhea symptoms related to carcinoid tumors and/or vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIPoma) tumors. The delayed-release oral formulation is used for the long-term treatment of acromegaly in patients who tolerate and respond adequately to injectable octreotide and .Acromegaly is a disorder caused by excess growth hormone (GH), increasing the growth of body tissues and causing metabolic dysfunction. Octreotide is a long-acting drug with pharmacologic activities that mimic those of the natural hormone, somatostatin, which inhibits the secretion of growth hormone. Additionally, it is used for the treatment of acromegaly and symptoms arising from various tumors, including carcinoid tumors and vasoactive intestinal tumors (VIPomas). In addition, octreotide relieves the flushing and diarrhea associated with gastrointestinal tumors by reducing splanchnic blood flow and various gastrointestinal hormones associated with diarrhea."
27,"Administration of exogenous oxytocin is indicated in the antepartum period to initiate or improve uterine contractions for vaginal delivery in situations where there is fetal or maternal concern. It should be noted that there are risks associated with oxytocin intervention during childbirth. It plays an important role in pair bonding, social cognition and functioning, and even fear conditioning. The elicited uterine contractions will then stimulate the release of increasing amounts of oxytocin. Since exogenously administered and endogenously secreted oxytocin result in the same effects on the female reproductive system, synthetic oxytocin may be used in specific instances during the antepartum and postpartum period to induce or improve uterine contractions."
28,"Daclizumab is a composite of human (90%) and murine (10%) antibody sequences. On 22 April 2008, Roche Registration Limited chose to voluntarily withdraw the marketing authorization for their product Zenapax (daclizumab), as indicated for the prophylaxis of acute organ rejection in de novo allogeneic renal transplantation and used concomitantly with an immunosuppressive regimen like cyclosporine and corticosteroids in patients who are not hight immunized, for commercial reasons and confirmed that this decision was not related to any safety concerns associated with the use of Zenapax (daclizumab) . Despite being approved for use, Zinbryta (daclizumab)'s complex pre-existing safety profile consisting of its restricted availability through a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program  and its black box warning for possible hepatic injury, autoimmune hepatitis, and other immune mediated disorders  meant its therapeutic usage, adverse effects, and prescribing information was subject to continuous monitoring and updating. Specifically it inhibits IL-2-mediated activation of lymphocytes, a critical pathway in the cellular immune response involved in allograft rejection.Zenepax binds with high-affinity to the Tac subunit of the high-affinity IL-2 receptor complex and inhibits IL-2 binding. The IL-2 receptor (Tac) subunit is expressed on activated but not resting lymphocytes."
29,"For nutritional supplementation and for treating dietary shortage or imbalance.This is the active form of vitamin B6 serving as a coenzyme for synthesis of amino acids, neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine), sphingolipids, aminolevulinic acid. In the liver they are converted to pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) which is a cofactor in many reactions of amino acid metabolism. Pyridoxal phosphate acts as a coenzyme in all transamination reactions, and in some   oxylation and deamination reactions of amino acids. The aldehyde group of pyridoxal phosphate forms a Schiff-base linkage with the epsilon-amino group of a specific lysine group of the aminotransferase enzyme. The alpha-amino group of the amino acid substrate displaces the epsilon-amino group of the active-site lysine residue."
30,"L-histidine may be indicated for use in some with rheumatoid arthritis. It is not indicated for treatment of anemia or uremia or for lowering serum cholesterol.An essential amino acid that is required for the production of histamine.Is found abundantly in hemoglobin; has been used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, allergic diseases, ulcers and anemia. However, some facts are known about L-histidine and some of its metabolites, such as histamine and trans-urocanic acid, which suggest that supplemental L-histidine may one day be shown to have immunomodulatory and/or antioxidant activities. Further, histamine has been shown to down-regulate the production of reactive oxygen species in phagocytic cells, such as monocytes, by binding to the H2 receptors on these cells. Decreased reactive oxygen species production by phagocytes could play antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory roles in such diseases as rheumatoid arthritis."
31,"It has also been suggested to be an effective antiviral agent.A six carbon compound related to glucose. It is found naturally in citrus fruits and many vegetables. Vitamin C is considered an antioxidant.Ascorbic Acid (vitamin C) is a water-soluble vitamin indicated for the prevention and treatment of scurvy, as ascorbic acid deficiency results in scurvy. Collagenous structures are primarily affected, and lesions develop in bones and blood vessels. Administration of ascorbic acid completely reverses the symptoms of ascorbic acid deficiency.In humans, an exogenous source of ascorbic acid is required for collagen formation and tissue repair by acting as a cofactor in the posttranslational formation of 4-hydroxyproline in -Xaa-Pro-Gly- sequences in collagens and other proteins."
32,"Glutamine can then be used as a nitrogen donor in the biosynthesis of many compounds, including other amino acids, purines, and pyrimidines. L-glutamine improves nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) redox potential .Supplemental L-glutamine's possible immunomodulatory role may be accounted for in a number of ways. L-glutamine appears to play a major role in protecting the integrity of the gastrointestinal tract and, in particular, the large intestine. The demand for L-glutamine by the intestine, as well as by cells such as lymphocytes, appears to be much greater than that supplied by skeletal muscle, the major storage tissue for L-glutamine. It can lead to an increased synthesis of glutathione in the intestine, which may also play a role in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal mucosa by ameliorating oxidative stress."
33,"For nutritional supplementation, also for treating dietary shortage or imbalanceAdenosine phosphate, or adenylic acid, is an adenine nucleotide containing one phosphate group esterified to the sugar moiety in the 2&#39;-, 3&#39;-, or 5&#39;-position. Adenosine phosphate was withdrawn by the FDA since it was considered neither safe nor effective for its intended uses as a vasodilator and an anti-inflammatory.Adenosine monophosphate, also known as 5'-adenylic acid and abbreviated AMP, is a nucleotide that is found in RNA. Studies have shown that mice fed a nucleotide-free diet have both impaired humoral and cellular immune responses. The addition of dietary nucleotides normalizes both types of responses. RNA, a delivery form of nucleotides, and ribonucleotides were used in these studies."
34,"Also used in conjunction with calcium in the management and prevention of primary or corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis.Calcitriol is an active metabolite of vitamin D with 3 hydroxyl (OH) groups and is commonly referred to as 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, or 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub>. Various studies demonstrated expression of vitamin D receptors in cancer cell lines, including mouse myeloid leukemia cells . Vitamin D appears to demonstrate both immune-enhancing and immunosuppressive effects.The mechanism of action of calcitriol in the treatment of psoriasis is accounted for by their antiproliferative activity for keratinocytes and their stimulation of epidermal cell differentiation. The anticarcinogenic activity of the active form of Calcitriol appears to be correlated with cellular vitamin D receptor (VDR) levels. The immunomodulatory activity of calcitriol is thought to be mediated by vitamin D receptors (VDRs) which are expressed constitutively in monocytes but induced upon activation of T and B lymphocytes."
35,"It is also essential for the production of niacin, the synthesis of the neurotransmitter serotonin and melatonin. Tryptophan supplements can be used as natural relaxants to help relieve insomnia. Tryptophan also appears to help the immune system and can reduce the risk of cardiac spasms. Tryptopan serves as the precursor for the synthesis of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) and melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine).A number of important side reactions occur during the catabolism of tryptophan on the pathway to acetoacetate. Kynurenine is the first key branch point intermediate in the pathway."
36,"Rickets is a condition produced due to a deficiency in vitamin D, calcium or phosphorus. Ergocalciferol was isolated for the first time from yeast in 1931 and its structure was elucidated in 1932. When compared to its vitamin D counterpart , ergocalciferol has been shown to present a reduced induction of calcidiol and hence, it is less potent. Ergocalciferol supplementation in patients with end-stage renal disease has been shown to generate a significant benefit in lab parameters of bone and mineral metabolism as well as improvement in glycemic control, serum albumin levels and reduced levels of inflammatory markers.For its activity, ergocalciferol is required to be transformed to its major active circulating hydroxylated metabolite and transported to the target organs in order to bind to its target, the vitamin D receptor. The activation of the vitamin D receptor is part of the vitamin D endocrine system and it is described by the production of a change in the transcription rates of the vitamin D receptor target genes."
37,"Folic acid is indicated for the treatment of folic acid deficiency, megaloblastic anemia, and in anemias of nutritional origins, pregnancy, infancy, or childhood.Folic acid, also known as folate or Vitamin B9, is a member of the B vitamin family and an essential cofactor for enzymes involved in DNA and RNA synthesis. More specifically, folic acid is required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. As a result, supplementation with 1-5mg of folic acid is recommended to prevent deficiency and a number of side effects associated with MTX therapy including mouth ulcers and gastrointestinal irritation. Folic acid is typically supplemented during pregnancy to prevent the development of NTDs and in individuals with alcoholism to prevent the development of neurological disorders, for example.Folic acid is a water-soluble B-complex vitamin found in foods such as liver, kidney, yeast, and leafy, green vegetables. More specifically, folic acid is required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein."
38,"For the treatment of vitamin A deficiency.Retinol and derivatives of retinol that play an essential role in metabolic functioning of the retina, the growth of and differentiation of epithelial tissue, the growth of bone, reproduction, and the immune response. It is also important for the maintenance of the proper functioning of the immune system.Vision:Vitamin A (all-trans retinol) is converted in the retina to the 11-cis-isomer of retinaldehyde or 11-cis-retinal. 11-cis-retinal, while attached to opsin in rhodopsin is isomerized to all-trans-retinal by light. All-trans-retinal is then released from opsin and reduced to all-rans-retinol. Epithelial differentiation: The role of Vitamin A in epithelial differentiation, as well as in other physiological processes, involves the binding of Vitamin A to two families of nuclear retinoid receptors (retinoic acid receptors, RARs; and retinoid-X receptors, RXRs)."
39,"Concurrently, as one of the most commonly utilized forms of vitamin D, cholecalciferol is also very frequently used as a supplement in individuals to maintain sufficient vitamin d levels in the body or to treat vitamin D deficiency, as well as various medical conditions that can be associated directly or indirectly with vitamin d insufficiency like osteoporosis and chronic kidney disease, among others .Vitamin D, in general, is a secosteroid generated in the skin when 7-dehydrocholesterol located there interacts with ultraviolet irradiation - like that commonly found in sunlight . These vitamin D metabolites subsequently facilitate the active absorption of calcium and phosphorus in the small intestine, serving to increase serum calcium and phosphate levels sufficiently to allow bone mineralization . Such deficiency is known for resulting in conditions like rickets or osteomalacia, all of which reflect inadequate mineralization of bone, enhanced compensatory skeletal demineralization, resultant decreased calcium ion blood concentrations, and increases in the production and secretion of parathyroid hormone . This final metabolite binds to endogenous vitamin d receptors, which results in a variety of regulatory roles - including maintaining  calcium balance, the regulation of parathyroid hormone, the promotion of the renal reabsorption of calcium, increased intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus, and increased calcium and phosphorus mobilization of calcium and phosphorus from bone to plasma to maintain balanced levels of each in bone and the plasma . Additionally, it is believed that when calcitriol binds with nuclear vitamin D receptors, that this bound complex itself binds to retinoic acid X receptor (RXR) to generate a heterodimeric complex that consequently binds to specific nucleotide sequences in the DNA called vitamin D response elements ."
40,"The primary known function of vitamin K is to assist in the normal clotting of blood, but it may also play a role in normal bone calcification.A synthetic naphthoquinone without the isoprenoid side chain and biological activity, but can be converted to active vitamin K2, menaquinone, after alkylation in vivo.Menadione (Vitamin K3) is a fat-soluble vitamin precursor that is converted into menaquinone in the liver. While a vitamin K deficiency can be dangerous, especially to infants that may easily suffer from extensive hemorrhaging, an overdose can be as equally detrimental. For this reason, K3 is less often utilized medically than it was in former times.Menadione (vitamin K3) is involved as a cofactor in the posttranslational gamma-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues of certain proteins in the body. The two vitamin K-dependent proteins found in bone are osteocalcin, also known as bone G1a (gamma-carboxyglutamate) protein or BGP, and the matrix G1a protein or MGP. Gamma-carboxylation is catalyzed by the vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylases."
41,"For nutritional supplementation, also for treating dietary shortage or imbalanceAn adenine nucleotide containing three phosphate groups esterified to the sugar moiety. In addition to its crucial roles in metabolism adenosine triphosphate is a neurotransmitter.Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the nucleotide known in biochemistry as the ""molecular currency"" of intracellular energy transfer; that is, ATP is able to store and transport chemical energy within cells. The energy used by human cells requires the hydrolysis of 200 to 300 moles of ATP daily. ATP cannot be stored, hence its consumption must closely follow its synthesis.ATP is able to store and transport chemical energy within cells. The energy used by human cells requires the hydrolysis of 200 to 300 moles of ATP daily."
42,"As well, pravastatin can be used as a secondary prevention agent for cardiovascular events in patients with clinically evident coronary heart disease. It was the first statin administered as the active form and not as a prodrug. The manufacturing process is followed by the hydrolysis of the lactone group and the biological hydroxylation with _Streptomyces carbophilus_ to introduce the allylic 6-alcohol group.The action of pravastatin on the 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase produces an increase in the expression of hepatic LDL receptors which in order decreases the plasma levels of LDL cholesterol. In clinical trials with patients with a history of myocardial infarction or angina with high total cholesterol, pravastatin decreased the level of total cholesterol by 18%, decreased of LDL by 27%, decreased of triglycerides by 6% and increased of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) by 4%. When coadministered with , pravastatin can reduce by 50% the levels of LDL and slow the progression of atherosclerosis and the risk of myocardial infarction and death.Pravastatin is a specific inhibitor of the hepatic HMG-CoA reductase in humans."
43,"It is also indicated for the treatment of heart failure (NYHA class II-IV) and for left ventricular dysfunction or failure after myocardial infarction when the use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) is not appropriate.Valsartan belongs to the angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) family of drugs, which also includes , , , , and . Valsartan was initially approved in 1996 in Europe for the treatment of hypertension in adults. Patients with heart failure given valsartan commonly have some reduction in blood pressure, but discontinuation of therapy because of continuing symptomatic hypotension usually is not necessary when dosing instructions are followed. Dosage reduction and/or discontinuation of valsartan may be required.Valsartan belongs to the angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) family of drugs, which selectively bind to angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1) and prevent angiotensin II from binding and exerting its hypertensive effects. The increased plasma levels of angiotensin II following AT1 receptor blockade with valsartan may stimulate the unblocked AT2 receptor."
44,"Ramiprilat is a potent, competitive inhibitor of ACE, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of angiotensin I (ATI) to angiotensin II (ATII). ATII regulates blood pressure and is a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). ADH stimulates further water reabsorption from the kidneys via insertion of aquaporin-2 channels on the apical surface of cells of the DCT and collecting tubules. Inhibiting the deactivation of bradykinin increases bradykinin levels and may sustain the effects of ramiprilat by causing increased vasodilation and decreased blood pressure.Ramipril inhibits the RAAS system by binding to and inhibiting ACE thereby preventing the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. ACE is also responsible for the breakdown of bradykinin."
45,For the management of mild to severe hypertension. May be used to reduce cardiovascular mortality following myocardial infarction in hemodynamically stable individuals who develop clinical signs of congestive heart failure within a few days following myocardial infarction.  To reduce the rate of death
46,"It may also be used to treat patients with spinal cord injuries and other spinal cord diseases. Baclofen was reintroduced in 1971 as a treatment for spasticity and was later approved by the FDA in 1977. It reduces the release of excitatory neurotransmitters in the pre-synaptic neurons and stimulates inhibitory neuronal signals in the post-synaptic neurons. In one cross-section study, intrathecal baclofen was more effective than oral baclofen in relieving spasticity directly at the level of the spinal cord. Baclofen is an agonist at the beta subunit of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors expressed on pre- and post-synaptic neurons."
47,"Amphetamine is indicated for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders (ADHD) as well as for the treatment of central nervous system disorders such as narcolepsy. This use derived into a large overproduction of amphetamine and all the surplus after the war finalized ended up in the black market, producing the initiation of the illicit abuse.From its mechanism of action, it has been demonstrated that amphetamine augments the concentration of noradrenaline in the prefrontal cortex and dopamine in the striatum on a dose and time-dependent manner. The complex of the amphetamine with the ions is actively transported by monoamine reuptake transporters. This activity is not done as an inhibitor per se but more as a competitive substrate and thus, amphetamine is known to be a weak dopamine reuptake inhibitor, moderate noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor and very weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor. This mechanism of action is often overpassed as amphetamine is a weak MAO inhibitor but this mechanism cannot be dismissed."
48,"Nicotine is also important medically because of its presence in tobacco smoke.Nicotine, the primary alkaloid in tobacco products binds stereo-selectively to nicotinic-cholinergic receptors on autonomic ganglia, the adrenal medulla, neuromuscular junctions and in the brain. Nicotine is a highly addictive substance. Nicotine is classified as a stimulant of autonomic ganglia.Nicotine is a stimulant drug that acts as an agonist at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. In the brain, nicotine binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on dopaminergic neurons in the cortico-limbic pathways. Calcium stimulates vesicle trafficking towards the plasma membrane and the release of dopamine into the synapse."
49,"For the treatment of symptoms of dry mouth in patients with Sj&ouml;gren's Syndrome.Cevimeline is a parasympathomimetic agent that act as an agonist at the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors M1 and M3. It is indicated by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of dry mouth associated with Sjögren's syndrome.Cevimeline is a cholinergic agonist which binds to muscarinic receptors. Muscarinic agonists in sufficient dosage can increase secretion of exocrine glands, such as salivary and sweat glands and increase tone of the smooth muscle in the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts.Muscarinic agonists such as cevimeline bind and activate the muscarinic M1 and M3 receptors. The M1 receptors are common in secretory glands (exocrine glands such as salivary and sweat glands), and their activation results in an increase in secretion from the secretory glands. The M3 receptors are found on smooth muscles and in many glands which help to stimulate secretion in salivary glands, and their activation generally results in smooth muscle contraction and increased glandular secretions."
50,"Lorazepam is FDA-approved for the short-term relief of anxiety symptoms related to anxiety disorders and anxiety associated with depressive symptoms such as anxiety-associated insomnia. Some off-label indications of lorazepam include rapid tranquilization of an agitated patient, alcohol withdrawal delirium, alcohol withdrawal syndrome, muscle spasms, insomnia, panic disorder, delirium, chemotherapy-associated anticipatory nausea and vomiting, and psychogenic catatonia.Lorazepam is a short-acting and rapidly cleared benzodiazepine used commonly as a sedative and anxiolytic. It was developed by DJ Richards, presented and marketed initially by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals in the USA in 1977. The first historic FDA label approval is reported in 1985 by the company Mutual Pharm.The effect of lorazepam in GABA-A receptors produces an increase in the frequency of opening of the chloride ion channel. However, for its effect to generate, the neurotransmitter is required."
51,"Also used in noncompensatory sinus tachycardia where the rapid heart rate requires specific intervention.Esmolol, commonly marketed under the trade name Brevibloc, is a cardioselective beta-1 receptor blocker. Esmolol prevents the action of two naturally occurring substances: epinephrine and norepinephrine. The FDA withdrew its approval for the use of all parenteral dosage form drug products containing esmolol hydrochloride that supply 250 milligrams/milliliter of concentrated esmolol per 10-milliliter ampule. Because it predominantly blocks the beta-1 receptors in cardiac tissue, it is said to be cardioselective. At therapeutic dosages, esmolol does not have intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) or membrane-stabilizing (quinidine-like) activity."
52,"The 26S proteasome is a protein complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway: reversible inhibition of the 26S proteasome, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of cancer cells, is thought to be the main mechanism of action of bortezomib. However, multiple mechanisms may be involved in the anticancer activity of bortezomib. In May 2003, bortezomib became the first anticancer proteasome inhibitor that was approved by the FDA under the trade name VELCADE. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is often dysregulated in pathological conditions, leading to aberrant pathway signalling and the formation of malignant cells. In one pharmacodynamic study, more than 75% of proteasome inhibition was observed in whole blood samples within one hour after dosing of bortezomib.The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is a homeostatic proteolytic pathway for intracellular protein degradation: proteins marked with a poly-ubiquitin chain are degraded to small peptides and free ubiquitin by the proteasome, which is a large multimeric protease."
53,"Used for short-term hypnotic therapy in the management of insomnia for periods of up to one week in duration; however, this medication generally has been replaced by other sedative-hypnotic agents.Ethchlorvynol is a sedative and hypnotic drug. It has been used to treat insomnia, but has been largely superseded and is only offered where an intolerance or allergy to other drugs exists.Ethchlorvynol is a sedative drug and schedule IV (USA) controlled substance. It produces cerebral depression, however the exact mechanism of action is not known.Although the exact mechanism of action is unknown, ethchlorvynol appears to depress the central nervous system in a manner similar to that of barbiturates. Barbiturates bind at a distinct binding sites associated with a Cl- ionopore at the GABAA receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl- ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged."
54,"Carbidopa presents a chemical denomination of N-amino-alpha-methyl-3-hydroxy-L-tyrosine monohydrate. It potently inhibits aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (DDC) and due to its chemical properties, it does not cross the blood-brain barrier. The action of carbidopa is very important as  is able to cross the blood-brain barrier while dopamine cannot. Hence the administration of carbidopa is essential to prevent the transformation of external  to dopamine before reaching the main action site in the brain.This effect has been highly observed by a significant reduction in  requirements and a significant reduction in the presence of side effects such as nausea. It has been observed that the effect of carbidopa is not dose-dependent.Carbidopa is an inhibitor of the DDC which in order, inhibits the peripheral metabolism of levodopa."
55,"Phentermine is indicated, alone or in combination with topiramate, as a short-term adjunct, not pass a few weeks, in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modifications and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity for patients with an initial body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 kg/m2 or greater than 27 kg/m2 in presence of other risk factors such as controller hypertension, diabetes or hyperlipidemia. It is an epidemic condition in the United States where over two-thirds of adults are overweight or obese and one in three Americans is obese. It is chemically related to amphetamine and it is commonly referred to as an atypical amphetamine. Some reports have indicated that the weight loss effect is mainly due to the increase in resting energy expenditure. As well, even though it is a derivative of the amphetamines, it has not been registered to produce any of the effects of amphetamine such as central nervous system stimulation, elevation of blood pressure, tachyphylaxis or QTc prolongation.Phentermine is an indirect-acting sympathomimetic agent that acts by releasing noradrenaline from the presynaptic vesicles in the lateral hypothalamus."
56,"Tramadol has also been shown to affect a number of other pain modulators within the central nervous system as well as non-neuronal inflammatory markers and immune mediators. Due to the broad spectrum of targets involved in pain and inflammation, it's not surprising that the evidence has shown that tramadol is effective for a number of pain types including neuropathic pain, post-operative pain, lower back pain, as well as pain associated with labour, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, and cancer. Similar to other opioid medications, tramadol poses a risk for development of tolerance, dependence and abuse.Tramadol modulates the descending pain pathways within the central nervous system through the binding of parent and M1 metabolite to μ-opioid receptors and the weak inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. During tramadol treatment, monitoring for signs and symptoms of hyponatremia is recommended for patients with predisposing risk factors. Particular care should be exercised when administering tramadol to patients who are suspected to be at an increased risk of experiencing torsade de pointes during treatment with a QTc-prolonging drug.Therefore, tramadol should be prescribed and handled with caution.Tramadol is a centrally acting μ-opioid receptor agonist and SNRI (serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake-inhibitor) that is structurally related to  and ."
57,"It has some antineoplastic properties and has broad spectrum activity against DNA viruses in cell cultures and significant antiviral activity against infections caused by a variety of viruses such as the herpes viruses, the vaccinia VIRUS and varicella zoster virus.Vidarabine is a synthetic purine nucleoside analogue with in vitro and in vivo inhibitory activity against herpes simplex virus types 1 (HSV-1), 2 (HSV-2), and varicella-zoster virus (VZV). This viral enzyme converts Vidarabine into Vidarabine monophosphate, a nucleotide analogue. In vitro, Vidarabine triphosphate stops the DNA replication of herpes virus by being incorporated into the DNA strand and preventing the formation of phosphodiester bridges between bases. Vidarabine is sequentially phosphorylated by kinases to the triphosphate ara-ATP, which is the active form of vidarabine that acts as both an inhibitor and a substrate of viral DNA polymerase. By acting as a substrate for viral DNA polymerase, ara-ATP competitively inhibits dATP leading to the formation of ‘faulty�?DNA."
58,"**A note on laboratory testing**    Obtaining specimens for fungal culture and other important laboratory studies such as serology or pathology is advised before starting fluconazole therapy in order to isolate the organisms to be eliminated through treatment. Fluconazole, commonly known as _Diflucan_, is an antifungal drug used for the treatment of both systemic and superficial fungal infections in a variety of tissues. It has been demonstrated as an efficacious treatment for vaginal yeast infections in one single dose.Fluconazole has been demonstrated to show fungistatic activity against the majority of strains of the following microorganisms, curing fungal infections:    _Candida albicans, Candida glabrata (Many strains are intermediately susceptible), Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, Cryptococcus neoformans_    This is achieved through steroidal inhibition in fungal cells, interfering with cell wall synthesis and growth as well as cell adhesion, thereby treating fungal infections and their symptoms. The fungistatic activity of fluconazole has also been shown in normal and immunocompromised animal models with both systemic and intracranial fungal infections caused by _Cryptococcus neoformans_ and for systemic infections caused by Candida albicans. Other studies have shown no significant effects of fluconazole on steroid levels, further confirming these data.Fluconazole is a very selective inhibitor of fungal cytochrome P450 dependent enzyme _lanosterol 14-α-demethylase_."
59,"For the treatment of Type II diabetes mellitus. It is used alone or in combination with a sulfonylurea, metformin, or insulin as an adjunct to diet and exercise.Troglitazone was withdrawn in 2000 due to risk of hepatotoxicity. Troglitazone is not chemically or functionally related to either the sulfonylureas, the biguanides, or the g-glucosidase inhibitors. Troglitazone may be used concomitantly with a sulfonylurea or insulin to improve glycemic control.Troglitazone is a thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agent that lowers blood glucose by improving target cell response to insulin. It has a unique mechanism of action that is dependent on the presence of insulin for activity."
60,"According to FDA prescribing information, oseltamivir is indicated for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated illness due to influenza A and B infection in patients 2 weeks of age and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 48 hours . Oseltamivir (marketed as the product Tamiflu�?, is an antiviral neuraminidase inhibitor used for the treatment and prophylaxis of infection with influenza viruses A (including pandemic H1N1) and B. Oseltamivir exerts its antiviral activity by inhibiting the activity of the viral neuraminidase enzyme found on the surface of the virus, which prevents budding from the host cell, viral replication, and infectivity. The clinical benefit of use of oseltamivir is greatest when administered within 48 hours of the onset of influenza symptoms since effectiveness decreases significantly after that point in time; there is generally no benefit in use beyond 48 hours for healthy, low-risk individuals as influenza is a self-limiting illness. The authors concluded that oseltamivir use in healthy adults had small, non-specific effects on symptoms (where the time to first alleviation of symptoms was only reduced from 7 to 6.3 days), it had no effect on hospitalizations, and that there was no evidence for any reductions in complications of influenza such as pneumonia. Because these events were reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made but they appear to be uncommon based on oseltamivir."
61,"Erythromycin is indicated in the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of various bacteria. The indications for erythromycin have been summarized by body system below:    **Respiratory infections**    Mild to moderate upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Haemophilus influenzae (when used concomitantly with appropriate doses of sulfonamides) can be treated with erythromycin. Clinical studies suggest that erythromycin may aid in the prevention of pertussis infection for individuals who have been exposed to the bacteria. Erythromycin can be used in nongonococcal urethritis can be used when tetracyclines cannot be administered. This results in the control of various bacterial infections."
62,"The second cofactor, Methylcobalamin, is necessary for the conversion of homocysteine to methionine which is essential for the metabolism of folic acid. Deficiency of tetrahydrafolate leads to reduced synthesis of thymidylate resulting in reduced synthesis of DNA which is essential for cell maturation. Vitamin B12 is also concerned in the maintenance of sulphydryl groups in reduced form, deficiency leading to decreased amounts of reduced SH content of erythrocytes and liver cells. Two of these, methylcobalamin and 5-deoxyadenosyl cobalamin, are primarily used by the body. This enzyme is involved in the conversion of the amino acid homocysteine into methionine."
63,"Caffeine is also used in a variety of cosmetic products and can be administered topically, orally, by inhalation, or by injection. One probable mechanism is the inhibition of nucleotide phosphodiesterase enzymes, adenosine receptors, regulation of calcium handling in cells, and participates in adenosine receptor antagonism. **Respiratory**    The exact mechanism of action of caffeine in treating apnea related to prematurity is unknown, however, there are several proposed mechanisms, including respiratory center stimulation in the central nervous system, a reduced threshold to hypercapnia with increased response, and increased consumption of oxygen, among others. Blocking of adenosine receptors promotes catecholamine release, leading to stimulatory effects occurring in the heart and the rest of the body. In the blood vessels, caffeine exerts direct antagonism of adenosine receptors, causing vasodilation."
64,"Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor that is predominantly employed for two primary indications:    (1) the treatment of erectile dysfunction ; and    (2) treatment of pulmonary hypertension, where:  a) the US FDA specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (WHO Group I) in adults to improve exercise ability and delay clinical worsening . After chronic dosing of 80 mg three times a day to patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension no clinically relevant effects on the ECG were reported either . In a study of the hemodynamic effects of a single oral 100 mg dose of sildenafil in 14 patients with severe coronary artery disease (CAD) (> 70 % stenosis of at least one coronary artery), the mean resting systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased by 7 % and 6 % respectively compared to baseline . In the natural setting, i.e. with sexual stimulation, it restores impaired erectile function by increasing blood flow to the penis . When the NO/cGMP pathway is activated, as occurs with sexual stimulation, inhibition of PDE5 by sildenafil results in increased corpus cavernosum levels of cGMP ."
65,"For the maintenance of normal sinus rhythm (delay in time to recurrence of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter ) in patients with atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter of greater than one week duration who have been converted to normal sinus rhythmDofetilide is a class III antiarrhythmic agent that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the maintenance of sinus rhythm in individuals prone to the formation of atrial fibrillation and flutter, and for the chemical cardioversion to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation and flutter.Dofetilide is an antiarrhythmic drug with Class III (cardiac action potential duration prolonging) properties and is indicated for the maintenance of normal sinus rhythm. Dofetilide increases the monophasic action potential duration in a predictable, concentration-dependent manner, primarily due to delayed repolarization. At concentrations covering several orders of magnitude, Dofetilide blocks only IKr with no relevant block of the other repolarizing potassium currents (e.g., IKs, IK1). At clinically relevant concentrations, Dofetilide has no effect on sodium channels (associated with Class I effect), adrenergic alpha-receptors, or adrenergic beta-receptors.The mechanism of action of Dofetilide is a blockade of the cardiac ion channel carrying the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current, IKr. This inhibition of potassium channels results in a prolongation of action potential duration and the effective refractory period of accessory pathways (both anterograde and retrograde conduction in the accessory pathway)."
66,"For the treatment of toxoplasmosis and acute malaria; For the prevention of malaria in areas non-resistant to pyrimethamineOne of the folic acid antagonists that is used as an antimalarial or with a sulfonamide to treat toxoplasmosis.Pyrimethamine is an antiparasitic compound commonly used as an adjunct in the treatment of uncomplicated, chloroquine resistant, P. falciparum malaria. Pyrimethamine possesses blood schizonticidal and some tissue schizonticidal activity against malaria parasites of humans. However, the 4-amino-quinoline compounds are more effective against the erythrocytic schizonts. It does not destroy gametocytes, but arrests sporogony in the mosquito. The action of pyrimethamine against Toxoplasma gondii is greatly enhanced when used in conjunction with sulfonamides.Pyrimethamine inhibits the dihydrofolate reductase of plasmodia and thereby blocks the biosynthesis of purines and pyrimidines, which are essential for DNA synthesis and cell multiplication."
67,"For the treatment of hypertensionAn alkaloid found in the roots of Rauwolfia serpentina and R. vomitoria. Reserpine inhibits the uptake of norepinephrine into storage vesicles resulting in depletion of catecholamines and serotonin from central and peripheral axon terminals. It has been used as an antihypertensive and an antipsychotic as well as a research tool, but its adverse effects limit its clinical use. The FDA withdrew its approval for the use of all oral dosage form drug products containing more than 1 mg of reserpine.Reserpine is an adrenergic blocking agent used to treat mild to moderate hypertension via the disruption of norepinephrine vesicular storage. The antihypertensive actions of Reserpine are a result of its ability to deplete catecholamines from peripheral sympathetic nerve endings."
68,"Used in patients, who have had a stroke or stroke precursors and who cannot take aspirin or aspirin has not worked, to try to prevent another thrombotic stroke. It is a prodrug that is metabolised to an active form, which blocks the ADP receptor that is involved in GPIIb/IIIa receptor activation leading to platelet aggregation. The FDA label includes a black-box warning of neutropenia, aplastic anemia, thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura, and agranulocytosis, so it is necessary to monitor patients' WBC and platelets when they are taking ticlopidine.Ticlopidine is a prodrug that is metabolised to an as yet undetermined metabolite that acts as a platelet aggregation inhibitor. In its prodrug form, ticlopidine has no significant in vitro activity at the concentrations attained in vivo.The active metabolite of ticlopidine prevents binding of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to its platelet receptor, impairing the ADP-mediated activation of the glycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa complex. It is proposed that the inhibition involves a defect in the mobilization from the storage sites of the platelet granules to the outer membrane."
69,"For the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency, detrusor instability and frequency of micturition.Trospium is an antispasmodic agent used to treat the symptoms of overactive bladder, a condition that causes the bladder muscles to contract uncontrollably. An overactive bladder leads to an increased urge to urinate, frequent urination, and sometimes, loss of control over urination. Trospium is manufactured by _Indevus Pharmaceutical Inc._ and was granted FDA approval in 2007.Trospium is an antispasmodic, antimuscarinic agent indicated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency. According to receptor assays, it displays higher affinity towards muscarininc receptors compared to nicotinic receptors at therapeutic concentrations. Trospium antagonizes the effect of acetylcholine on muscarinic receptors in cholinergically innervated organs."
70,"For the treatment of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension (OH).An ethanolamine derivative that is an adrenergic alpha agonist. Administration of midodrine results in a rise in standing, sitting, and supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients with orthostatic hypotension of various etiologies. Standing systolic blood pressure is elevated by approximately 15 to 30 mmHg at 1 hour after a 10-mg dose of midodrine, with some effect persisting for 2 to 3 hours. Desglymidodrine acts as an agonist at the alpha1-adrenergic receptors expressed in the arteriolar and venous vasculature. Desglymidodrine is reported to have negligible effect on the cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors."
71,"**Pantoprazole Injection**:    **Treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease associated with a history of erosive esophagitis**    Pantoprazole for injection is indicated for short-term treatment (7-10 days) of patients having gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with a history of erosive esophagitis, as an alternative to oral medication in patients who are unable to continue taking pantoprazole delayed-release tablets. **Pantoprazole delayed-release oral suspension**:    **Short-Term Treatment of erosive esophagitis associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)**    Indicated in adults and pediatric patients five years of age and above for the short-term treatment (up to 8 weeks) in the healing and symptomatic relief of erosive esophagitis. Pantoprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cell. The enzyme is inactivated, inhibiting gastric acid secretion. The inhibition of gastric acid secretion is stronger with proton pump inhibitors such as pantoprazole and lasts longer than with the H(2) antagonists."
72,"As well, torasemide is approved to be used as an antihypertensive agent either alone or in combination with other antihypertensives.Torasemide is a high-ceiling loop diuretic. This effect is obtained by the increase in the excretion of urinary sodium and chloride. Several reports have indicated that torasemide presents a long-lasting diuresis and less potassium excretion which can be explained by the effect that torasemide has on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Above the aforementioned effect, torasemide presents a dual effect .in which the inhibition of aldosterone which donates torasemide with a potassium-sparing action. This effect is suggested to be related to the decrease in aldosterone which in order has been shown to reduce the production of the enzyme procollagen type I carboxy-terminal proteinase which is known to be overexpressed in heart failure patients.As mentioned above, torasemide is part of the loop diuretics and thus, it acts by reducing the oxygen demand in the medullary thick ascending loop of Henle by inhibiting the Na+/K+/Cl- pump on the luminal cell membrane surface."
73,"Citalopram is an antidepressant belonging to the class of selective _serotonin-reuptake inhibitors_ (SSRIs) widely used to treat the symptoms of depression. Citalopram enhances serotonergic transmission through the inhibition of serotonin reuptake, and among all the SSRIs, citalopram appears to be the most selective toward serotonin reuptake inhibition. Citalopram was approved by the FDA in 1998 for the treatment of depression in adults 18 years or older.Citalopram belongs to a class of antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). It has been found to relieve or manage symptoms of depression, anxiety, eating disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder among other mood disorders. The chronic administration of citalopram has been shown to downregulate central norepinephrine receptors, similar to other drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder."
74,"For the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults.Eletriptan is a second generation triptan drug developed by Pfizer Inc for the treatment of migraine headaches.Eletriptan is a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine 1B/1D receptor agonist. In the anesthetized dog, eletriptan has been shown to reduce carotid arterial blood flow, with only a small increase in arterial blood pressure at high doses. While the effect on blood flow was selective for the carotid arterial bed, decreases in coronary artery diameter were observed. In contrast, eletriptan displays insignificant pharmacological activity at adrenergic alpha1, alpha2, or beta; dopaminergic D1 or D2; muscarinic; or opioid receptors. While the full mechanism of action of 5-HT receptor agonists in relieving migrains is not fully elucidated, it is proposed that the activation of 5-HT1 receptors located on intracranial blood vessels leads to vasoconstriction that correlates with the relief of migraine headaches."
75,"For the treatment of hypertension.A guanidinium antihypertensive agent that acts by blocking adrenergic transmission.Bethanidine is a guanidinium antihypertensive agent that acts by blocking adrenergic transmission. The precise mode of action is not clear. Although bethanidine may produce adverse effects, they are beneficial in severe hypertension and produce fewer side effects than guanethidine.Bethanidine, a guanidine derivative, is a peripherally acting antiadrenergic agent which primarily acts as an alpha2a adrenergic agonist. Bethanidine effectively decreases blood pressure by suppressing renin secretion or interfering with function of the sympathetic nervous system."
76,"Also for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis (pinkeye).Moxifloxacin is a synthetic fluoroquinolone antibiotic agent. Bayer AG developed the drug (initially called BAY 12-8039) and it is marketed worldwide (as the hydrochloride) under the brand name Avelox (in some countries also Avalox) for oral treatment.Moxifloxacin is a quinolone/fluoroquinolone antibiotic. Moxifloxacin can be used to treat infections caused by the following bacteria: Aerobic Gram-positive microorganisms: _Corynebacterium_ species, _Micrococcus luteus_, _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Staphylococcus epidermidis_, _Staphylococcus haemolyticus_, _Staphylococcus hominis_, _Staphylococcus warneri_, _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, and _Streptococcus viridans_ group. Aerobic Gram-negative microorganisms: _Acinetobacter lwoffii_, _Haemophilus influenzae_, and _Haemophilus parainfluenzae_. Moxifloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.The bactericidal action of moxifloxacin results from inhibition of the enzymes topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV."
77,"Nelfinavir inhibits the HIV viral proteinase enzyme which prevents cleavage of the gag-pol polyprotein, resulting in noninfectious, immature viral particles.Nelfinavir is a protease inhibitor with activity against Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1). Protease inhibitors block the part of HIV called protease. This inhibition prevents cleavage of the viral polyproteins resulting in the formation of immature non-infectious viral particles. Protease inhibitors are almost always used in combination with at least two other anti-HIV drugs.HIV viral protease is an important enzyme for HIV maturation and pathogenicity since HIV produces its structural and key proteins in the form of a polyprotein that needs to be cleaved by a protease. Nelfinavir is a competitive inhibitor of the HIV protease by reversibly binding to the active site of the enzyme, preventing it from interacting with its substrate to produce mature and infectious viral particles."
78,"For the treatment of asthma, wheezing, and chronic asthmatic bronchitis.Isoetharine is a relatively selective beta-2 adrenergic agonist. It is a catechol-like agent. Isoetharine is a fast-acting bronchodilator used for emphysema, bronchitis and asthma.Isoetharine is a beta-adrenergic receptor agonist. While it is reported to demonstrate more selectivity towards beta-2 adrenergic receptors, isoetharine still binds to beta-1 adrenergic receptors and thus may be associated with beta-1-mediated adverse events. Isoetharine produces maximal bronchodilation within 15 minutes of inhalation.Isoetharine-induced bronchodilator occurs from an increased activity of adenyl cyclase, which augments the formation of cyclic AMP (cAMP)."
79,"It may also be indicated for use in combination with metformin or insulin to lower blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes whose high blood sugar levels cannot be controlled by diet and exercise in conjunction with an oral hypoglycemic (a drug used to lower blood sugar levels) agent alone.First introduced in 1995, glimepiride is a member of the second-generation sulfonylurea (SU) drug class used for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to improve glycemic control. Glimepiride works by stimulating the secretion of insulin granules from pancreatic islet beta cells by blocking ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K<SUB>ATP</SUB> channels) and causing depolarization of the beta cells. In this study, there was a reduction in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) by 46 mg/dL, post-prandial glucose (PPG) by 72 mg/dL, and HbA1c by 1.4% more than the placebo. The 4- and 8-mg doses of glimepiride were more effective than the 1-mg dose; however, the 4-mg dose provided a nearly maximal antihyperglycemic effect.ATP-sensitive potassium channels on pancreatic beta cells that are gated by intracellular ATP and ADP. In contrast, increased uptake of glucose into the cell leads to elevated intracellular ATP:ADP ratio, leading to the closure of channels and membrane depolarization."
80,"Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Diflorasone is a potent topical corticosteroid that should not be used with occlusive dressings. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2."
81,"Lovastatin is indicated to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and the need for coronary revascularization procedures in individuals without symptomatic cardiovascular disease, average to moderately elevated total-C and LDL-C, and below average HDL-C. Lovastatin is also indicated to slow the progression of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with coronary heart disease as part of a treatment strategy to lower total-C and LDL-C to target levels. While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint,  is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg  per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decrease in LDL cholesterol levels, while lovastatin has been found to have an average decrease in LDL-C of 25-40%. Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors coadministered with , and caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing these two medications together. The overall effect is a decrease in plasma LDL and VLDL and a significant reduction in the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality."
82,"Low concentrations of enflurane can also be used as an adjunct to general anesthetic drugs during delivery by Cesarean section.Enflurane is a halogenated inhalational anesthetic initially approved by the FDA in 1972. Studies on rats indicate that enflurane binds to GABAA and glycine receptors, causing depressant effects at the ventral neural horn. It has been reported that 30% of the central nervous system depressant effects on the spinal cord after enflurane is administered are caused by the (GABA-A) receptor while binding to glycine receptors is responsible for about 20 % of the depressant effects. Other studies have found that enflurane binds to the calcium channels in the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum causing cardio depressant effects. Other studies support that this drug potentiates glycine receptors, which results in central nervous system depressant effects."
83,For treatment of severe infections caused by susceptible bacteria.One of the cephalosporins that has a broad spectrum of activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms.Cefotiam is a third generation beta-lactam cephalosporin antibiotic that works by inhibiting bacterial cell wall biosynthesis. It is a broad spectrum antibiotic that is effective against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria.The bactericidal activity of cefotiam results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs).
84,"Pregabalin is indicated for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury, and as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients 1 month of age and older.Pregabalin is structurally similar to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) - an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Pregabalin is marketed by Pfizer under the trade name Lyrica and Lyrica Cr (extended release). It may have dependence liability if misused but the risk appears to be highest in patients with current or past substance use disorders.Although the structure of pregabalin is similar to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), it does not bind to GABA receptors. Although the mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated, studies involving structurally related drugs suggest that presynaptic binding of pregabalin to voltage-gated calcium channels is key to the antiseizure and antinociceptive effects observed in animal models. Although pregabalin is a structural derivative of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), it does not bind directly to GABA or benzodiazepine receptors."
85,"Although the chemical synthesis of temazepam was established by 1965 , mainstream contemporary use of the medication did not occur until it's legitimate use as treatment for insomnia was accepted and approved later on. Temazepam increases the affinity of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) for GABA receptors by binding to benzodiazepine receptors . Conversely, if half-lives are short, the drug and metabolites would be cleared before the next dose is ingested, and carry-over effects related to sedation or CNS depression should be minimal or not present at all . However, during nightly use and for an extended period, pharmacodynamic tolerance or adaptation to some effects of benzodiazepine hypnotics may develop - which may also contribute to the possibility of 'rebound insomnia' . Combined with the notion that such benzodiazepine receptor associated GABA(a) receptors exist both peripherally and in the CNS, this activity consequently facilitates various effects like sedation, hypnosis, skeletal muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, and anxiolytic action ."
86,"(From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p825)Methyclothiazide, a diuretic-antihypertensive agent, is a member of the benzothiadiazine (thiazide) class of drugs. Methyclothiazide has a per mg natriuretic activity approximately 100 times that of the prototype thiazide, chlorothiazide. Like other benzothiadiazines, methyclothiazide also has antihypertensive properties, and may be used for this purpose either alone or to enhance the antihypertensive action of other drugs.Methyclothiazide appears to block the active reabsorption of chloride and possibly sodium in the ascending loop of Henle, altering electrolyte transfer in the proximal tubule. This results in excretion of sodium, chloride, and water and, hence, diuresis. As a diuretic, methyclothiazide inhibits active chloride reabsorption at the early distal tubule via the Na-Cl cotransporter, resulting in an increase in the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water."
87,"The sodium salt of the drug is better tolerated than the free acid.The two major considerations in the clinical pharmacology of aminosalicylic acid are the prompt production of a toxic inactive metabolite under acid conditions and the short serum half life of one hour for the free drug. Aminosalicylic acid is bacteriostatic against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (prevents the multiplying of bacteria without destroying them). It also inhibits the onset of bacterial resistance to streptomycin and isoniazid.There are two mechanisms responsible for aminosalicylic acid's bacteriostatic action against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The binding of para-aminobenzoic acid to pteridine synthetase acts as the first step in folic acid synthesis. Aminosalicylic acid binds pteridine synthetase with greater affinity than para-aminobenzoic acid, effectively inhibiting the synthesis of folic acid."
88,"Milrinone is indicated for the short-term (48 hours or less) treatment of patients with acute decompensated heart failure. Often the result of long-term myocardial ischemia, cardiomyopathy, or other cardiac insults, heart failure results from an inability of the heart to perfuse peripheral tissues with sufficient oxygen and metabolites, resulting in complex systemic pathologies. Heart failure is underpinned by numerous physiological changes, including alteration in β-adrenergic signalling and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production, which affects the heart's contractile function and cardiac output. As a PDE-III inhibitor, milrinone results in increased cAMP levels and improves cardiac function and peripheral vasodilation in acute decongested heart failure. It was approved by the FDA on December 31, 1987, and was marketed under the trademark PRIMACOR® by Sanofi-Aventis US before being discontinued.Milrinone is a bipyridine derivative with positive inotropic and lusitropic effects that also results in peripheral vasodilation with minimal chronotropic effects over a therapeutic range of 100 to 300 ng/mL."
89,"For the treatment of polycythaemia vera and refractory chronic myeloid leukaemia.An antineoplastic agent that acts by alkylation.Pipobroman is an antineoplastic agent. Specifically, it is a piperazine derivative with a chemical structure close to that of many DNA alkylating agents. Pipobroman has well-documented clinical activity against polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia.The mechanism of action is uncertain, but due to the structural similarity with other DNA alkylating agents, pipobroman is thought to alkylate DNA leading to disruption of DNA synthesis and eventual cell death."
90,"Butabarbital should not be used to treat insomnia for longer than 2 weeks.Butabarbital, or Butisol, is a fast onset barbiturate with short duration of action compared to other barbiturates. This makes butabarbital a useful drug for treating severe insomnia and pre-operative anxiety. Butabarbital was granted FDA approval on 5 June 1939.Butabarbital potentiates GABAergic neurons while inhibiting neuronal acetylcholine and glutamate receptors to produce sedation. Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of worsening insomnia, drowsiness, falls, and complex behaviour while not fully awake.Barbiturates like butabarbital potentiate GABA-A receptors and inhibit receptors for neuronal acetylcholine, and kainate. Inhibition of neuronal acetylcholine receptors and glutamate receptors of the kainate subtype desensitize their respective neurons, producing sedation."
91,"A potent, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) used in combination with nucleoside analogues for treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) infection and AIDS. Structurally, nevirapine belongs to the dipyridodiazepinone chemical class.Nevirapine is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (nNRTI) with activity against Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1). HIV-2 RT and eukaryotic DNA polymerases (such as human DNA polymerases alpha, beta, or sigma) are not inhibited by nevirapine. Nevirapine is, in general, only prescribed after the immune system has declined and infections have become evident. It is always taken with at least one other HIV medication such as Retrovir or Videx."
92,"It is marketed under the brand names Oxistat and Oxistat, and is used in the treatment of various skin infections such as athlete's foot, jock itch and ringworm.Oxiconazole is a broad-spectrum imidazole derivative whose antifungal activity is derived primarily from the inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis, which is critical for cellular membrane integrity. It has fungicidal or fungistatic activity in vitro against a number of pathogenic fungi including the following dermatophytes, and yeasts: T. rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, T. violaceum, E. floccosum, M. canis,M. It acts to destabilize the fungal cyctochrome P450 51 enzyme (also known as Lanosterol 14-alpha demethylase). Its inhibition leads to cell lysis. Oxiconazole has also been shown in inhibit DNA synthesis and suppress intracellular concentrations of ATP."
93,"Alclometasone is a selective glucocorticoid receptor agonist.The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2. This complex migrates to the nucleus where it binds to different glucocorticoid response elements on the DNA."
94,"It is a short-to-intermediate acting member of barbiturates that exhibit muscle-relaxing and anti-anxiety properties that produce central nervous system (CNS) depression that ranges from mild sedation to general anesthesia. Butalbital‐containing analgesics can also produce a drug‐induced headache in addition to tolerance and dependence. Due to these risks, the use of butalbital-containing combination products is typically limited for use only in cases where other medications are deemed ineffective and such usage is advised to be carefully monitored.Butalbital is a short to intermediate-acting barbiturate that reversibly depresses the activity of excitable tissues, including the central nervous system in a nonselective manner. While butalbital is expected to mediate similar actions as other members of the barbiturate drug class, the effects of butalbital in isolation are not well understood. It is also proposed that barbiturates and opioids may potentiate the analgesic effects of each other when co-administered, although there are inconsistencies across preclinical data."
95,"For the treatment of active hairy cell leukemia (leukemic reticuloendotheliosis) as defined by clinically significant anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or disease-related symptoms. Also used as an alternative agent for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.An antineoplastic agent used in the treatment of lymphoproliferative diseases including hairy-cell leukemia.Cladribine is a synthetic purine nucleoside that acts as an antineoplastic agent with immunosuppressive effects. Cladribine differs structurally from deoxyadenosine only by the presence of a chlorine atom at position 2 of the purine ring, which results in resistance to enzymatic degradation by adenosine deaminase. Due to this resistance, cladribine exhibits a more prolonged cytotoxic effect than deoxyadenosine against resting and proliferating lymphocytes. Although the exact mechanism of action has not been fully determined, evidence shows that cladribine is phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase to the nucleotidecladribine triphosphate (CdATP; 2-chloro-2�?deoxyadenosine 5�?triphosphate), which accumulates and is incorporated into DNA in cells such as lymphocytes that contain high levels of deoxycytidine kinase and low levels of deoxynucleotidase, resulting in DNA strand breakage and inhibition of DNA synthesis and repair."
96,"Mesalazine is indicated for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in adults and patients 5 years or older.. Mesalazine is also indicated for the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis in adults and maintenance of remission of Crohn's ileocolitis. An anti-inflammatory agent, structurally related to the salicylates and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like acetylsalicylic acid, which is active in inflammatory bowel disease . Although demonstrably effective in treating and maintaining remission for ulcerative colitis, mesalazine has historically faced a number of issues regarding its lack of stability as a pharmaceutical agent . Throughout the late seventies and the eighties, important research initiatives developed stable mesalazine formulations like the eudragit-S coating of Asacol brand mesalazine and the Pentasa brand's encapsulation of mesalazine within microgranules . Moreover, since increased leukocyte migration, abnormal cytokine production, increased production of arachidonic acid metabolites, particularly leukotriene B4, and increased free radical formation in the inflamed intestinal tissue are all present in patients with inflammatory bowel disease it is also believed that mesalazine has in-vitro and in-vivo pharmacological effects that inhibit leukocyte chemotaxis, decrease cytokine and leukotriene production and scavenge for free radicals."
97,"Parkinsonism is a general term that refers to the group of neurological disorders that produce symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease such as tremors, slow movement, and stiffness. Reports have indicated that benztropine has a very large sedative effect. The antihistaminic effect of benztropine is very similar to the effect found in  and the anticholinergic activity was found to be equal to  _ex vivo_ and of about 50% activity _in vivo_.Benztropine is an agent with anti-muscarinic and antihistaminic effects. Its main mechanism of action is presented by the selective inhibition of dopamine transporters but it also presents affinity for histamine and muscarine receptors. As well, it is known to be an analog of atropine and hence, it has a large affinity for muscarinic receptors M1 in the human brain."
98,"In its oral form, ziprasidone is approved for the treatment of schizophrenia, as monotherapy for acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes related to bipolar I disorder, and as adjunctive therapy to lithium or valproate for maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder. The injectable formulation is approved only for treatment of acute agitation in schizophrenia.Disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder can significantly impair mood, cognition, and behavior. It can effectively reduce the rate and time of relapses in schizophrenia, and can be used to treat manic episodes in bipolar disorder although the mechanism of action is unknown. Although ziprasidone is classified as an atypical antipsychotic, it appears to have a lower incidence of metabolic adverse effects compared to other medications in the same class.Ziprasidone is classified as a ""second generation"" or ""atypical"" antipsychotic and is a dopamine and 5HT2A receptor antagonist with a unique receptor binding profile. Ziprasidone binds to serotonin-2A (5-HT2A) and dopamine D2 receptors in a similar fashion to other atypical antipsychotics; however, one key difference is that ziprasidone has a higher 5-HT2A/D2 receptor affinity ratio when compared to other antipsychotics such as olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and aripiprazole."
99,"For the treatment of vascular headacheAn ergot derivative that is a congener of lysergic acid diethylamide. It antagonizes the effects of serotonin in blood vessels and gastrointestinal smooth muscle, but has few of the properties of other ergot alkaloids. Methysergide is used prophylactically in migraine and other vascular headaches and to antagonize serotonin in the carcinoid syndrome.Methysergide has been shown,in vitro and in vivo, to inhibit or block the effects of serotonin, a substance which may be involved in the mechanism of vascular headaches. Serotonin has been variously described as a central neurohumoral agent or chemical mediator, as a ""headache substance"" acting directly or indirectly to lower pain threshold, as an intrinsic ""motor hormone"" of the gastrointestinal tract, and as a ""hormone"" involved in connective tissue reparative processes.Methysergide is serotonin antagonists acts on central nervous system (CNS), which directly stimulates the smooth muscle leading to vasoconstriction. Some alpha-adrenergic blocking activity has been reported."
100,It is used to treat hyperprolactinemic disorders and Parkinsonian Syndrome. High dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway of the brain causes hallucinations and delusions; these side effects of dopamine agonists are manifestations seen in patients with schizophrenia who have overractivity in this area of the brain. The hallucinogenic side effects of dopamine agonists may also be due to 5-HT2A agonism. Stimulation of dopamine D2 receptors in the nigrostriatal pathway leads to improvements in coordinated muscle activity in those with movement disorders. Cabergoline is a long-acting dopamine receptor agonist with a high affinity for D2 receptors.
101,"For the treatment and management of leprosy and dermatitis herpetiformis.A sulfone active against a wide range of bacteria but mainly employed for its actions against mycobacterium leprae. Its mechanism of action is probably similar to that of the sulfonamides which involves inhibition of folic acid synthesis in susceptible organisms. As an anti-infective agent, it is also used for treating malaria and, recently, for Pneumocystic carinii pneumonia in AIDS patients. Dapsone is absorbed rapidly and nearly completely from the gastrointestinal tract. Dapsone is distributed throughout total body water and is present in all tissues."
102,"This drug is available in cream and suppository forms and both have demonstrated high levels of safety, efficacy, and tolerability in clinical trials. It is structurally related to imidazole-derivative antifungal agents, although terconazole and other triazoles have 3 nitrogens in the azole ring. By inhibiting the 14-alpha-demethylase (lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase), Terconazole inhibits ergosterol synthesis. Terconazole and other triazole antifungal agents inhibit cytochrome P450 14-alpha-demethylase in susceptible fungi, which leads to the accumulation of lanosterol and other methylated sterols and a decrease in ergosterol concentration. Depletion of ergosterol in the membrane disrupts the structure and function of the fungal cell leading to a decrease or inhibition of fungal growth."
103,"Injectable phenytoin and , which is the phosphate ester prodrug formulation of phenytoin, are indicated to treat tonic-clonic status epilepticus, and for the prevention and treatment of seizures occurring during neurosurgery.Phenytoin is classified as a hydantoin derivative and despite its narrow therapeutic index, it is one of the most commonly used anticonvulsants. Since it's introduction about 80 years ago, phenytoin has not only been established as an effective anti-epileptic, but has also been investigated for several other indications such as bipolar disorder, retina protection, and wound healing. Although the recommended therapeutic range is cited to be between 10-20 mg/L, differences in albumin levels, genetics, comorbidities, and body composition can make achieving an ideal phenytoin dose challenging. For example, studies have confirmed that phenytoin metabolism is impacted by CYP2C9 genotype polymorphisms and possibly by CYP2C19 genotype polymorphisms (the latter has not been as extensively studied). Although phenytoin first appeared in the literature in 1946, it has taken decades for the mechanism of action to be more specifically elucidated."
104,"For the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis, vernal conjunctivitis, episcleritis, and epinephrine sensitivity.Medrysone is a corticosteroid used in ophthalmology.Medrysone is a topical anti-inflammatory corticoidsteroids for ophthalmic use. In patients with increased intraocular pressure and in those susceptible to a rise in intraocular pressure, there is less effect on pressure with medrysone than with dexamethasone or betamethasone. Corticoidsteroids inhibit the edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, and phagocytic migration of the acute inflammatory response, as well as capillary proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation.There is no generally accepted explanation for the mechanism of action of ocular corticosteroids. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid."
105,Second-generation tetracyclines exhibit lesser toxicity than first-generation tetracyclines. Doxycycline is used to treat a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections. It is also used to treat acne and malaria.Doxycycline and other tetracyclines are mainly bacteriostatic and are thought to exert antimicrobial effects by the inhibition of protein synthesis. Doxycycline inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by allosterically binding to the 30S prokaryotic ribosomal subunit. Doxycycline ultimately impedes the elongation phase of protein synthesis and halts the production of essential proteins for bacterial survival and functioning.
106,"Some of the infections that can be treated with lymecycline include upper respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, bronchitis, chlamydial infections, and rickettsial infections.Lymecycline is a broad-spectrum second-generation tetracycline antibiotic used for the treatment of acne and other susceptible bacterial infections. Lymecycline was initially discovered in 1961. Lymecycline is not marketed in the USA, however, equivalent drugs are available, such as minocycline and .Lymecycline, like other tetracyclines, exerts bacteriostatic actions on intracellular and extracellular bacteria, treating susceptible bacterial infections. It has been shown to be safe and effective in the  treatment of moderate to severe acne. It is not recommended to administer this drug in patients with renal disease or severe hepatic disease.Normally, the ribosome synthesizes proteins through the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex."
107,"It is also indicated as a prophylactic drug to reduce the incidence of oropharyngeal candidiasis in patients immunocompromised by conditions such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or steroid therapy utilized in the treatment of leukemia, solid tumors, or renal transplantation . Troche preparations are not indicated for the treatment of any systemic mycoses .This drug is a broad spectrum antimycotic or antifungal agent. Clotrimazole causes inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis, an essential constituent of fungal cell membranes. If ergosterol synthesis is either completely or partially inhibited, the cell is no longer able to construct an intact and functional cell membrane ,. Though decreased ergosterol, due to the inhibition of lanosterol 14-demethylase (also known as _CYP51_)  is accepted to be primarily responsible for the antimycotic properties of clotrimazole, this drug also shows other pharmacological effects."
108,"Calcium acetate is one of a number of calcium salts used to treat hyperphosphatemia (too much phosphate in the blood) in patients with kidney disease.The chemical compound calcium acetate is the calcium salt of acetic acid. It has been commonly referred to as the acetate of lime. The anhydrous form is very hygroscopic, therefore the monohydrate is the common form.Patients with advanced renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min) exhibit phosphate retention and some degree of hyperphosphatemia. The rate of removal of phosphate by dietary manipulation or by dialysis is insufficient. Dialysis patients absorb 40% to 80% of dietary phosphorus."
109,"For the treatment of vulvovaginitis caused by Candida albicans.Sulfanilamide is a molecule containing the sulfonamide functional group attached to an aniline.Sulfanilamide is a sulfonamide antibiotic. Sulfonamides inhibit multiplication of bacteria by acting as competitive inhibitors of p-aminobenzoic acid in the folic acid metabolism cycle. Bacterial sensitivity is the same for the various sulfonamides, and resistance to one sulfonamide indicates resistance to all. However, parenteral administration is difficult, since the soluble sulfonamide salts are highly alkaline and irritating to the tissues. The inhibited reaction is normally necessary in these organisms for the synthesis of folic acid."
110,"Anagrelide is indicated for the treatment of thrombocythemia, secondary to malignant neoplasms, to reduce platelet count and the associated risk of thrombosis. It is an oral imidazoquinazoline that was first approved for use in the US in 1997. It appears to carry a better response rate than other thrombocythemia treatments (e.g. , ) and may be better tolerated.Anagrelide decreases platelet counts by suppressing transcription factors necessary for the synthesis and maturation of platelet-producing cells. The drug itself appears to have a relatively short residence time in the body necessitating twice or four times daily dosing. Evidence from animal studies suggests anagrelide may impair female fertility."
111,"It is used in the treatment of brain tumors and various other malignant neoplasms. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p462) This substance may reasonably be anticipated to be a carcinogen according to the Fourth Annual Report on Carcinogens (NTP 85-002, 1985). (From Merck Index, 11th ed)Carmustine is one of the nitrosoureas indicated as palliative therapy as a single agent or in established combination therapy with other approved chemotherapeutic agents in treatment of brain tumors, multiple myeloma, Hodgkin's disease, and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Carmustine also binds to and modifies (carbamoylates) glutathione reductase. This leads to cell death."
112,"For the treatment of severe, repeated, or long-lasting urinary tract infections, meningococcal meningitis, acute otitis media, trachoma, inclusion conjunctivitis, nocardiosis, chancroid, toxoplasmosis, malaria and other bacterial infections.A short-acting sulfonamide antibacterial with activity against a wide range of gram- negative and gram-positive organisms.Sulfisoxazole is a sulfonamide antibiotic. The sulfonamides are synthetic bacteriostatic antibiotics with a wide spectrum against most gram-positive and many gram-negative organisms. However, many strains of an individual species may be resistant. Bacterial sensitivity is the same for the various sulfonamides, and resistance to one sulfonamide indicates resistance to all. Their antibacterial action is inhibited by pus.Sulfisoxazole is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase."
113,"Metoprolol is indicated for the treatment of angina, heart failure, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter and hypertension. Some off-label uses of metoprolol include supraventricular tachycardia and thyroid storm. All the indications of metoprolol are part of cardiovascular diseases. These conditions correspond to a number of diseases that involve the function of the heart and blood vessels. As well, in clinical trials performed in 1990, metoprolol reduces mortality and re-infarction in 17% of the individuals when administered chronically after an episode of myocardial infarction.Metoprolol is a beta-1-adrenergic receptor inhibitor specific to cardiac cells with negligible effect on beta-2 receptors."
114,"It is used as an oral anticoagulant and acts by inhibiting the hepatic synthesis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors (prothrombin and factors VII, IX, and X). Dicumarol inhibits vitamin K reductase, resulting in depletion of the reduced form of vitamin K (vitamin KH2). The synthesis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X and anticoagulant proteins C and S is inhibited. Depression of three of the four vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors (factors II, VII, and X) results in decresed prothrombin levels and a decrease in the amount of thrombin generated and bound to fibrin. This reduces the thrombogenicity of clots."
115,"Used to treat female gynecologic and obstetric infections caused by susceptible aerobic (including the gonococcus) and anaerobic bacteria.Cefmenoxime is a novel broad-spectrum and third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic that is typically used in the treatment of female gynecologic and obstetric infections. It is reported to exhibit high activity against a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.Cefmenoxime is a semisynthetic beta-lactam cephalosporin antibiotic with activity similar to that of cefotaxime. It has broad spectrum activity against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria.The bactericidal activity of cefmenoxime results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Cefmenoxime is stable in the presence of a variety of b-lactamases, including penicillinases and some cephalosporinases."
116,"For the treatment of the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease and for the treatment of primary moderate-severe restless legs syndrome .Ropinirole, also known as _ReQuip_, is a non-ergoline dopamine agonist used in Parkinson's disease and restless legs syndrome , . **Effects on Parkinson's and restless leg syndrome**    This drug promotes the relief or improvement of symptoms of Parkinson's or restless leg syndrome by stimulatory actions on dopamine receptors, which regulate movement. **Effects on QT interval**    Ropinirole had no dose- or exposure-related effect on average QT intervals in healthy male and female volunteers at doses up to 4 mg/day. The exact mechanism of action of ropinirole as a treatment for Parkinson’s disease is unknown, however, it is believed to be related to its ability to selectively stimulate dopamine D2 receptors within the caudate-putamen system in the brain. Ropinirole has no affinity at the D1-like receptors, benzodiazepine or GABA receptors ."
117,"Used to treat symptoms of menopause, deficiencies in ovary function (including underdevelopment of female sexual characteristics and some types of infertility), and in rare cases, prostate cancer. Chlorotrianisene may also be used to prevent breast engorgement following childbirth.A powerful synthetic, non-steroidal estrogen. After menopause, when the body no longer produces estrogen, chlorotrianisene is used as a simple replacement of estrogen. The estrogen-stimulated endometrium may bleed within 48-72 hours after discontinuance of estrogen therapy. The benefit derived from estrogen therapy in the prevention of postpartum breast engorgement must be carefully weighed against the potential&nbsp;increased risk of puerperal thromboembolism&nbsp;associated with the use of large doses of estrogens.Chlorotrianisene binds to the estrogen receptor on various estrogen receptor bearing cells."
118,"Isradipine binds to calcium channels with high affinity and specificity and inhibits calcium flux into cardiac and arterial smooth muscle cells. It exhibits greater selectivity towards arterial smooth muscle cells owing to alternative splicing of the alpha-1 subunit of the channel and increased prevalence of inactive channels in smooth muscle cells. Isradipine may be used to treat mild to moderate essential hypertension.Isradipine decreases arterial smooth muscle contractility and subsequent vasoconstriction by inhibiting the influx of calcium ions through L-type calcium channels. Isradipine belongs to the dihydropyridine (DHP) class of calcium channel blockers (CCBs), the most widely used class of CCBs. Since arterial smooth muscle depolarizations are longer in duration than cardiac muscle depolarizations, inactive channels are more prevalent in smooth muscle cells."
119,"It can be used for imaging the gastrointestinal tract in patients allergic to barium.A commonly used x-ray contrast medium. As diatrizoate meglumine and as Diatrizoate sodium, it is used for gastrointestinal studies, angiography, and urography.Diatrizoate is the most commonly used water-soluble, iodinated, radiopaque x-ray contrast medium. They contain iodine, which blocks x-rays. The resulting high level of iodine allows the x-rays to make a ""picture"" of the area. The areas of the body in which the radiopaque agent localizes will appear white on the x-ray film."
120,"Topiramate is indicated  for the following conditions: 1)Monotherapy for partial onset or primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures for patients 2 years of age and above 2)Adjunctive therapy for partial onset seizures or primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures for both adult and pediatric patients above 2 years old 3)Adjunctive therapy for seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in patients above 2 years of age 4)Prophylaxis of migraine in children 12 years of age and older and adults. Topiramate is also used off-label as an adjunct therapy for weight management and for mood disorders.Topiramate is a anti-epileptic drug used to manage seizures and prevent migraines. In 2004, topiramate was approved for the prevention of migraine in adults. A seizure is an abnormal and unregulated electrical discharge occurring in the brain. Topiramate has been observed to exert actions on voltage-dependent sodium channels, GABA receptors, and glutamate receptors."
121,"For the treatment of infections caused by susceptible organisms.A semisynthetic cephamycin antibiotic with a broad spectrum of activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. It has a high rate of efficacy in many types of infection and to date no severe side effects have been noted.Cefmetazole is a second-generation cephalosporin. The cephalosporins are bactericidal drugs with both gram-positive and gram-negative activity. They inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis in a way similar to the penicillins. Cefmetazole is more active than 1st-generation cephalosporins against indole-positive Proteus,Serratia, anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (including B. fragilis), and some E. coli, Klebsiella, and P. mirabilis, but is less active than cefoxitin or cefotetan against most gram-negative bacilli.The bactericidal activity of cefmetazole results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs)."
122,"ARBs selectively bind to angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1) and prevent the protein angiotensin II from binding and exerting its hypertensive effects, which include vasoconstriction, stimulation and synthesis of aldosterone and ADH, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium, among others. **Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients**    In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, such as volume-and/or salt-depleted patients (e.g., those being treated with high doses of diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may be anticipated after initiation of treatment with olmesartan. In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system (e.g., patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and rarely with acute renal failure and/or death. There has been no long-term use of olmesartan medoxomil in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but similar results may be expected. ARBs selectively bind to angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1) and prevent the protein angiotensin II from binding and exerting its hypertensive effects."
123,"For treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia.Aminoacridine derivative that is a potent intercalating antineoplastic agent. It is effective in the treatment of acute leukemias and malignant lymphomas, but has poor activity in the treatment of solid tumors. It is effective in the treatment of acute leukemias and malignant lymphomas, but has poor activity in the treatment of solid tumors. It produces consistent but acceptable myelosuppression and cardiotoxic effects.Amsacrine binds to DNA through intercalation and external binding. Rapidly dividing cells are two to four times more sensitive to amsacrine than are resting cells."
124,"For the treatment of the symptoms and reversible airflow obstruction associated with chronic asthma and other chronic lung diseases, such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis.A methylxanthine derivative from tea with diuretic, smooth muscle relaxant, bronchial dilation, cardiac and central nervous system stimulant activities. Mechanistically, theophylline acts as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, adenosine receptor blocker, and histone deacetylase activator. Theophylline is marketed under several brand names such as Uniphyl and Theochron, and it is indicated mainly for asthma, bronchospasm, and COPD.Theophylline, an xanthine derivative chemically similar to caffeine and theobromine, is used to treat asthma and bronchospasm. Theophylline has two distinct actions in the airways of patients with reversible (asthmatic) obstruction; smooth muscle relaxation (i.e., bronchodilation) and suppression of the response of the airways to stimuli (i.e., non-bronchodilator prophylactic effects).Theophylline relaxes the smooth muscle of the bronchial airways and pulmonary blood vessels and reduces airway responsiveness to histamine, methacholine, adenosine, and allergen. Theophylline competitively inhibits type III and type IV phosphodiesterase (PDE), the enzyme responsible for breaking down cyclic AMP in smooth muscle cells, possibly resulting in bronchodilation."
125,"For the treatment of documented ventricular arrhythmias, such as sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular pre-excitation and cardiac dysrhythmias. It is a Class Ia antiarrhythmic drug.A class I anti-arrhythmic agent (one that interferes directly with the depolarization of the cardiac membrane and thus serves as a membrane-stabilizing agent) with a depressant action on the heart similar to that of guanidine. It also possesses some anticholinergic and local anesthetic properties.Disopyramide is an anti-arrhythmic drug indicated for the treatment of documented ventricular arrhythmias, such as sustained ventricular tachycardia that are life-threatening. At therapeutic plasma levels, disopyramide shortens the sinus node recovery time, lengthens the effective refractory period of the atrium, and has a minimal effect on the effective refractory period of the AV node. Little effect has been shown on AV-nodal and His-Purkinje conduction times or QRS duration."
126,"In particular, lidocaine's principal mode of action in acting as a local anesthetic that numbs the sensations of tissues means the agent is indicated for facilitating local anesthesia for a large variety of surgical procedures . As a result, lidocaine is also considered a class Ib anti-arrhythmic agent . With central neural blockade these changes may be attributable to the block of autonomic fibers, a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system, and/or the beta-adrenergic receptor stimulating action of epinephrine when present . In particular, such cardiac effects are likely associated with the principal effect that lidocaine elicits when it binds and blocks sodium channels, inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of electrical action potential impulses necessary to facilitate muscle contraction . Subsequently, in cardiac myocytes, lidocaine can potentially block or otherwise slow the rise of cardiac action potentials and their associated cardiac myocyte contractions, resulting in possible effects like hypotension, bradycardia, myocardial depression, cardiac arrhythmias, and perhaps cardiac arrest or circulatory collapse ."
127,"Pamidronic acid was first described in the literature in 1977. Pamidronic acid was granted FDA approval on 31 October 1991.Pamidronic acid is a second generation, nitrogen containing bisphosphonate that inhibits osteoclast mediated bone loss It has a wide therapeutic index and a long duration of action as it can be given every 3-4 weeks for certain indications. Bone resorption by osteoclasts causes local acidification, releasing the bisphosphonate, which is taken into the osteoclast by fluid-phase endocytosis. Disruption of the podosomes causes osteoclasts to detach from bones, preventing bone resorption. The lack of prenylation of these proteins interferes with their function, and in the case of Rap1, leads to apoptosis."
128,"Used as self-medication for temporary relief of symptoms associated with the common cold.An ethanolamine-derivative, first generation histamine H1 antagonist used in hay fever, rhinitis, allergic skin conditions, and pruritus. It causes drowsiness.Clemastine is an antihistamine that also induces anticholinergic and sedative effects. Antihistamines competitively antagonize various physiological effects of histamine including increased capillary permeability and dilatation, the formation of edema, the ""flare"" and ""itch"" response, and gastrointestinal and respiratory smooth muscle constriction. Within the vascular tree, H1- receptor antagonists inhibit both the vasoconstrictor and vasodilator effects of histamine. Depending on the dose, H1- receptor antagonists can produce CNS stimulation or depression."
129,"Acarbose is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.Acarbose is a complex oligosaccharide that acts as an inhibitor of several enzymes responsible for the breakdown of complex carbohydrates in the intestines. It inhibits both pancreatic alpha-amylase and membrane-bound alpha-glucosidases - including intestinal glucoamylase, sucrase, maltase, and isomaltase - which are responsible for the metabolism of complex starches and oligo-, tri-, and disaccharides into absorbable simple sugars. Acarbose is one of only two approved alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (the other being ), receiving its first FDA approval in 1995 under the brand name Precose (since discontinued). This class of antidiabetic therapy is not widely used due to their relatively modest impact on A1c, their requirement for thrice-daily dosing, and the potential for significant gastrointestinal adverse effects.Acarbose is a complex oligosaccharide that competitively inhibits the ability of brush-border alpha-glucosidase enzymes to break down ingested carbohydrates into absorbable monosaccharides, reducing carbohydrate absorption and subsequent postprandial insulin levels. There have been rare post-marketing reports of the development of pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis following treatment with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors - patients experiencing significant diarrhea/constipation, mucus discharge, and/or rectal bleeding should be investigated and, if pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis is suspected, should discontinue therapy.Alpha-glucosidase enzymes are located in the brush-border of the intestinal mucosa and serve to metabolize oligo-, tri-, and disaccharides (e.g. sucrose) into smaller monosaccharides (e.g. glucose, fructose) which are more readily absorbed."
130,"Venlafaxine is indicated for the management of major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), and panic disorder.Venlafaxine is an antidepressant and a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). Its active metabolite, , works by blocking the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, which are key neurotransmitters in mood regulation. The immediate formulation of the drug, marketed as Effexor, was first approved by the FDA in 1993 and the extended-release formulation, Effexor XR, was later introduced in 1997. Venlafaxine was also investigated in off-label uses for the prophylaxis of migraine headaches, for reduction of vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause, and for the management of neuropathic pain (although there is only minimal evidence of efficacy for this condition).Venlafaxine is an antidepressant agent that works to ameliorate the symptoms of various psychiatric disorders by increasing the level of neurotransmitters in the synapse. Venlafaxine does not mediate muscarinic, histaminergic, or adrenergic effects.The exact mechanism of action of venlafaxine in the treatment of various psychiatric conditions has not been fully elucidated; however, it is understood that venlafaxine and its active metabolite O-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV) potently and selectively inhibits the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine at the presynaptic terminal."
131,"- Treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy due to menopause. The conjugated estrogens are noncrystalline mixtures of purified female sex hormones obtained either by its isolation from the urine of pregnant mares or by synthetic generation from vegetal material. The currently approved product of conjugated estrogens was developed by Wyeth Ayerst and FDA approved in 2003.The binding of estrogens to the estrogen receptor produces the activation of nuclear receptors in order to bind to estrogen response elements in certain target genes. It has also been tested and confirmed that conjugated estrogens present a selective estrogen receptor modulator profile which allows it to have a large beneficial effect on the bone and cardiovascular system. In the hormonal area, it is shown to inhibit luteinizing hormone and decrease the serum concentration of testosterone.The conjugated estrogens, equally to the normal physiological estrogen, work by agonistically binding to the estrogen receptors alpha and beta."
132,"Travoprost is indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Unlike other prostaglandin analogues, travoprost demonstrates full agonism and high selectivity at the prostanoid receptor, reporting a higher efficacy in reducing intraocular pressure and a reduced risk for developing off-target side effects.Travoprost demonstrates preferential affinity and full agonist activity for the prostaglandin FP receptor in the nanomolar range. Significant lowering of intraocular pressure can be maintained for periods exceeding 24 hours with a single dose.Travoprost is a prodrug. Upon administration, travoprost is absorbed through the cornea and hydrolyzed to its active metabolite, travoprost free acid. By binding to the FP receptor, travoprost free acid increases the outflow of aqueous humour via the trabecular meshwork and uveoscleral pathways, thereby reducing the intraocular pressure."
133,"The topical corticosteroids constitute a class of primarily synthetic steroids used as anti-inflammatory and antipruritic agents. Amcinonide reduces or inhibits the actions of chemicals in the body that cause inflammation, redness, and swelling. There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in man. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2."
134,"This is beneficial in the treatment of ADHD as DA activation in the subcortical NA and striatum is associated with many stimulant-associated side effects and an increase in abuse potential, which is a limiting factor associated with the use of stimulant medications such as , , and . Concerns about abuse potential have spurred research into medications with fewer effects on DA and the use of non-stimulant ADHD medications including atomoxetine,  and . The non-stimulant norepinephrine/dopamine reuptake inhibitor  (commonly used for the treatment of depression and for smoking cessation) has also been shown to be effective in the treatment of ADHD.Atomoxetine is a selective norepinephrine (NE) reuptake inhibitor used for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Atomoxetine should be used with caution in patients whose underlying medical conditions could be worsened by increases in blood pressure or heart rate such as certain patients with hypertension, tachycardia, or cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. Atomoxetine should be discontinued in patients with jaundice or laboratory evidence of liver injury, and should not be restarted."
135,"For treatment of chronic lymphatic (lymphocytic) leukemia,  childhood minimal-change nephrotic syndrome, and malignant lymphomas including lymphosarcoma, giant follicular lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease,  non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia.A nitrogen mustard alkylating agent used as antineoplastic agent for the treatment of various malignant and nonmalignant diseases. Although it is less toxic than most other nitrogen mustards, it has been listed as a known carcinogen in the Fourth Annual Report on Carcinogens (NTP 85-002, 1985). (Merck Index, 11th ed)Chlorambucil is an antineoplastic in the class of alkylating agents that is used to treat various forms of cancer. Alkylating agents are so named because of their ability to add alkyl groups to many electronegative groups under conditions present in cells. Alkylating agents work by three different mechanisms all of which achieve the same end result - disruption of DNA function and cell death.Alkylating agents work by three different mechanisms: 1) attachment of alkyl groups to DNA bases, resulting in the DNA being fragmented by repair enzymes in their attempts to replace the alkylated bases, preventing DNA synthesis and RNA transcription from the affected DNA, 2) DNA damage via the formation of cross-links (bonds between atoms in the DNA) which prevents DNA from being separated for synthesis or transcription, and 3) the induction of mispairing of the nucleotides leading to mutations."
136,"Used in the induction of general anesthesia.Imidazole derivative anesthetic and hypnotic with little effect on blood gases, ventilation, or the cardiovascular system. It has been proposed as an induction anesthetic.Etomidate is a non-barbiturate hypnotic that acts at the level of the reticular-activating system to produce anesthesia. Like the barbiturates and propofol, etomidate is does not induce analgesia. Etomidate induces unconsciousness within one circulation time. Recovery is rapid as a result of extensive redistribution and rapid metabolism.Etomidate binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl- ionopore at the GABAA receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl- ionopore is open."
137,"It is used to treat cancer of the colon and rectum. It may also be used to treat other kinds of cancer, as determined by your doctor. Raltitrexed blocks an enzyme needed by the cell to live. This interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Other effects, like hair loss, may not be serious but may cause concern.Raltitrexed is an antineoplastic Agents and folic acid antagonists."
138,"Morphine is used for the management of chronic, moderate to severe pain. Opiods, including morphine, are effective for the short term management of pain. Patients taking opioids long term may need to be monitored for the development of physical dependence, addiction disorder, and drug abuse.Morphine, the main alkaloid of opium, was first obtained from poppy seeds in 1805. It is a potent analgesic, though its use is limited due to tolerance, withdrawal, and the risk of abuse. Morphine was granted FDA approval in 1941.Morphine binding to opioid receptors blocks transmission of nociceptive signals, signals pain-modulating neurons in the spinal cord, and inhibits primary afferent nociceptors to the dorsal horn sensory projection cells."
139,"Used to treat bacterial infection by susceptible microorganisms.Antibiotic analog of .Flucloxacillin is a penicillin beta-lactam antibiotic used in the treatment of bacterial infections caused by susceptible, usually gram-positive, organisms. The name ""penicillin"" can either refer to several variants of penicillin available, or to the group of antibiotics derived from the penicillins. Flucloxacillin has <i>in vitro</i> activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The bactericidal activity of Flucloxacillin results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis and is mediated through flucloxacillin binding to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). Flucloxacillin is stable against hydrolysis by a variety of beta-lactamases, including penicillinases, and cephalosporinases and extended spectrum beta-lactamases.By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, flucloxacillin inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis."
140,"Taken orally, tranexamic acid is indicated for the treatment of hereditary angioedema, cyclic heavy menstrual bleeding in premenopausal females, and other instances of significant bleeding in the context of hyperfibrinolysis. It possesses a similar mechanism of action to  but is approximately 10-fold more potent. At much higher concentrations it behaves as a noncompetitive inhibitor of plasmin similar to , a similar antifibrinolytic which is 10-fold less potent. Tranexamic acid binds more strongly than aminocaproic acid to both the strong and weak receptor sites of the plasminogen molecule in a ratio corresponding to the difference in potency between the compounds. Consider EEG monitoring of patients with a history of seizure.Tranexamic acid competitively and reversibly inhibits the activation of plasminogen via binding at several distinct sites, including four or five low-affinity sites and one high-affinity site, the latter of which is involved in its binding to fibrin."
141,"- Complicated urinary tract infections, including pyelonephritis. - Acute pelvic infections, including postpartum endomyometritis, septic abortion and post-surgical gynecologic infections. Shown to be effective against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, ertapenem is used to treat various bacterial infections.Ertapenem is a carbapenem antibiotic with time-dependent bactericidal activity.

142,"Oral desogestrel is used in combination with  as a contraceptive agent for the prevention of pregnancy. It was firstly generated from a study that showed that 11-beta and 11-alkylidene substituent in nortestosterone can enhance the biological activity. The first approved drug containing desogestrel was developed by Organon USA Inc in 1972 and FDA approved in 1992.The effects of desogestrel are divided on reproductive including modification of luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone, declines on the onset of menstruation, and increases the viscosity of the vaginal fluid; and on metabolic that includes increase insulin secretion and resistance, increased lipase activity, and increased fat deposition. Desogestrel main therapeutic effect due to its mechanism of action is known to be related to the inhibition of the ovulation in 97% of the cycles. Desogestrel has been widely confirmed to be related to an increase in the risk of venous thromboembolism due to the driven increased in blood coagulation factors, leading to a pronounced prothrombotic state."
143,"For treatment of malignant neoplasm of lip, oral cavity, pharynx, digestive organs, peritoneum, female breast, and urinary bladder. Also used as an adjunct to ab externo glaucoma surgery. It is an alkylating agent that inhibits DNA synthesis (and, at higher concentrations, RNA and protein synthesis) by cross-linking the complementary strands of the DNA double helix. Mitomycin's cross-linking activity has resulted in its approval for the treatment of a variety of cancers - the most recent of which is an April 2020 approval for its use in low-grade Upper Tract Urothelial Cancer (LG-UTUC) - as well as adjunctly to _ab externo_ glaucoma surgeries.Mitomycin is one of the older chemotherapy drugs, which has been around and in use for decades.

146,"Indicated for the rapid conversion of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter of recent onset to sinus rhythm.Ibutilide is a Class III antiarrhythmic agent available in intravenous formulations. It is indicated for the conversion of acute atrial flutter and recent onset atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm (NSR).Ibutilide prolongs the action potential duration and increases both atrial and ventricular refractoriness in vivo, i.e., class III electrophysiologic effects. Voltage clamp studies indicate that ibutilide, at nanomolar concentrations, delays repolarization by activation of a slow, inward current (predominantly sodium), rather than by blocking outward potassium currents, which is the mechanism by which most other class III antiarrhythmics act.Ibutilide is a 'pure' class III antiarrhythmic drug, used intravenously against atrial flutter and fibrillation. At a cellular level it exerts two main actions: induction of a persistent Na+ current sensitive to dihydropyridine Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blockers and potent inhibition of the cardiac rapid delayed rectifier K<sup>+</sup> current, by binding within potassium channel pores. In other words, Ibutilide binds to and alters the activity of hERG potassium channels, delayed inward rectifier potassium (IKr) channels and L-type (dihydropyridine sensitive) calcium channels"
147,"For the treatment of acute leukaemia, malignant lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, acute erythraemia and acute panmyelosisVinblastine derivative with antineoplastic activity against cancer. Major side effects are myelosuppression and neurotoxicity. Vindesine is used extensively in chemotherapy protocols (antineoplastic combined chemotherapy protocols).Vindesine is indicated for the treatment of acute lymphocytic leukemia of childhood that is resistant to vincristine and non-oat cell lung cancer. Vindesine causes the arrest of cells in metaphase mitosis. Unlike vinblastine, vindesine produces very few postmetaphase cells."
148,"Chlorthalidone has also been found useful in edema due to various forms of renal dysfunction, such as nephrotic syndrome, acute glomerulonephritis, and chronic renal failure.Chlorthalidone is a thiazide-like diuretic used for the treatment of hypertension and for management of edema caused by conditions such as heart failure or renal impairment. Chlorthalidone is considered first-line therapy for management of uncomplicated hypertension as there is strong evidence from meta-analyses that thiazide diuretics such as chlorthalidone reduce the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and cardiovascular all-cause mortality in patients with hypertension. Chlorthalidone has been shown to have a number of pleiotropic effects that differentiate it from other diuretics such as . These pathways may play a role in chlorthalidone's cardiovascular risk reduction effects.Chlorthalidone prevents reabsorption of sodium and chloride through inhibition of the Na+/Cl- symporter in the cortical diluting segment of the ascending limb of the loop of Henle. Reduction of sodium reabsorption subsequently reduces extracellular fluid and plasma volume via an osmotic, sodium-driven diuresis."
149,"For use in the treatment of duodenal ulcers, as a diuretic, and in the treatment of glaucoma, and may also be useful in the treatment of seizures associated with epilepsy.Ethoxzolamide is a sulfonamide used as diuretic and in glaucoma. It inhibits carbonic anhydrase activity in proximal renal tubules to decrease reabsorption of water, sodium, potassium, bicarbonate. Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the eye contributes to its effect of reducing intraocular pressure and decreasing aqueous humor. Ethoxzolamide binds to and inhibits carbonic anhydrase I, which plays an essential role in facilitating the transport of CO2 and H+ in the intracellular space, across biological membranes, and in the layers of the extracellular space. Through inhibition of the enzyme, the balance of applicable membrane equilibrium systems are affected."
150,"For the short-term treatment of insomnia.A short-acting barbiturate that is effective as a sedative and hypnotic (but not as an anti-anxiety) agent and is usually given orally. It is prescribed more frequently for sleep induction than for sedation but, like similar agents, may lose its effectiveness by the second week of continued administration. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1994, p236)Pentobarbital, a barbiturate, is used for the treatment of short term insomnia. It belongs to a group of medicines called central nervous system (CNS) depressants that induce drowsiness and relieve tension or nervousness. Little analgesia is conferred by barbiturates; their use in the presence of pain may result in excitation.Pentobarbital binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl- ionopore at the GABAA receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl- ionopore is open."
151,"4) Acute management of mania associated with bipolar disorder. It is also thought that valproate exerts a neuroprotective effect preventing damage and neural degeneration in epilepsy, migraines, and bipolar disorder. The FDA labeling contains a warning regarding HIV reactivation during valproate use..The exact mechanisms by which valproate exerts it's effects on epilepsy, migraine headaches, and bipolar disorder are unknown however several pathways exist which may contribute to the drug's action. The inhibition of the PKC pathway may also be a contributor to migraine prophylaxis. Histone hyperacetylation at the BDNF gene, increasing BDNF expression, post-seizure is known to occur and is thought to be a neuroprotective mechanism which valproate may strengthen or prolong."
152,"Used in the treatment of tuberculosis in combination with other drugs.Cyclic peptide antibiotic similar to viomycin. It is produced by Streptomyces capreolus.Capreomycin is a member of the aminoglycoside family of antibiotics. These antibiotics have the ability to kill a wide variety of bacteria, including bacteria responsible for causing tuberculosis (TB).Little is known about capreomycin's exact mechanism of action, but it is thought to inhibit protein synthesis by binding to the 70S ribosomal unit. Capreomycin also binds to components in the bacterial cell which result in the production of abnormal proteins. Therefore the production of these abnormal proteins is ultimately fatal to the bacteria."
153,"Zolmitriptan is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without auras in patients aged 18 and over.Zolmitriptan is a member of the triptan class of 5-hydroxytryptamine(5-HT)1B/1D/(1F) receptor agonists used to treat acute migraine. It is through the downstream effects of 5-HT1B/1D activation that triptans are proposed to provide acute relief of migraines. In addition, neurological deficits, collectively termed migraine aura, may precede the headache phase. The head pain associated with migraine is thought to be a consequence of activation of the nociceptive nerves comprising the trigeminocervical complex (TCC). Although triptans are classically described solely in terms of their effects on 5-HT1B/1D receptors, they also act as 5-HT1F agonists as well."
154,"In general, acetaminophen is used for the treatment of mild to moderate pain and reduction of fever. It is available over the counter in various forms, the most common being oral forms. As opposed to the _salicylate_ drug class, acetaminophen does not disrupt tubular secretion of uric acid and does not affect acid-base balance if taken at the recommended doses. According to its FDA labeling, acetaminophen's exact mechanism of action has not been fully established - despite this, it is often categorized alongside NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) due to its ability to inhibit the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathways. Acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, therefore, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory effects."
155,"For the continued treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after failure of either platinum-based or docetaxel chemotherapies.Gefitinib (originally coded ZD1839) is a drug used in the treatment of certain types of cancer. Acting in a similar manner to erlotinib (marketed as Tarceva), gefitinib selectively targets the mutant proteins in malignant cells. EGFR is expressed on the cell surface of many normal cells and cancer cells.Gefitinib is an inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase that binds to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding site of the enzyme. EGFR is often shown to be overexpressed in certain human carcinoma cells, such as lung and breast cancer cells. By inhibiting EGFR tyrosine kinase, the downstream signaling cascades are also inhibited, resulting in inhibited malignant cell proliferation."
156,"Codeine, an opioid analgesic, was originally approved in the US in 1950 and is a drug used to decrease pain by increasing the threshold for pain without impairing consciousness or altering other sensory functions. **Effects on intestinal motility**    Codeine may reduce intestinal motility through both a local and possibly central mechanism of action . **Effects on the central nervous system**    Codeine phosphate is an opioid analgesic with uses similar to those of morphine, but is much less potent as an analgesic. **Effects on chronic cancer pain and other types of pain**    Codeine is an opioid analgesic with similar indications to those of morphine, however, is much less potent in its pain alleviating properties. Other hypotheses also postulate that codeine-6-glucuronide, the main metabolite of codeine, mediates the analgesic effect of codeine as it not only has an affinity to the mu receptors as codeine but also can be metabolized to morphine-6-glucuronide, which was observed to be more potent than morphine."
157,"For the treatment of polymicrobial infections.Semisynthetic, broad-spectrum, ampicillin derived ureidopenicillin antibiotic proposed for pseudomonas infections. Piperacillin has <i>in vitro</i> activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The bactericidal activity of Piperacillin results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis and is mediated through Piperacillin binding to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). Piperacillin is stable against hydrolysis by a variety of beta-lactamases, including penicillinases, and cephalosporinases and extended spectrum beta-lactamases.By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, Piperacillin inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that Piperacillin interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."
158,"The recently approved Precision Olfactory Delivery technology developed by Impel Neuropharma technology has correlated with an increase of 3-fold in Cmax and 4-fold in AUC despite the solution formulated at 75% of the strength of the existing intranasal product.DHE is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine headaches with or without aura and the acute treatment of cluster headache episodes. It is thought to exert its therapeutic effect through both neurological and vascular mechanisms. The same serotonin agonist activity also contributes to vasoconstriction, producing both the characteristic side effect of chest tightness and potentially contributing to a therapeutic effect by counteracting the vasodilation due to calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) release in migraine attacks.DHE has several proposed mechanisms which may contribute to its therapeutic efficacy as an abortive therapy in migraines. Further action on 5-HT1b and 5-HT1d receptors with the addition of agonist activity on 5-HT1f in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis decreases afferent signalling to trigeminal sensory neurons which contributes to central sensitization. Lastly, action at 5-HT1d receptors on trigeminal nerve terminals inhibits the release of vasoactive neuropeptides thought to contribute to pain and inflammation during a migraine attack."
159,"This product should only be prescribed by a healthcare professional with expertise in the management of persistent enuresis     Off-label uses: irritable bowel syndrome, sleep disorders, diabetic neuropathy, agitation, fibromyalgia, and insomnia Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that has been used to treat depression for decades. Amitriptyline has been investigated in the treatment of pain-related conditions, attributed to its analgesic properties. **Effects in pain and depression**    Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant and an analgesic. **Cardiovascular and Anticholinergic Effects**    Amitriptyline has strong anticholinergic properties and may cause ECG changes and quinidine-like effects on the heart . This drug counteracts these mechanisms, and this may be the mechanism of amitriptyline in improving depressive symptoms."
160,"For palliative management of gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma metastatic to the liver, when given by continuous regional intra-arterial infusion in carefully selected patients who are considered incurable by surgery or other means. When administered by slow, continuous, intra-arterial infusion, it is converted to floxuridine monophosphate. Floxuridine rapidly undergoes catabolism to form 5-fluorouracil, which is the active component of the drug. 5-Fluorouracil primarily works by interfering with DNA synthesis; however, it may also inhibit the formation of fraudulent RNA via physical incorporation into the RNA. Floxuridine can also form 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-phosphate (FUDR-MP), which is the monophosphate of floxuridine that inhibits thymidylate synthetase that plays a role in the methylation of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid during DNA synthesis."
161,"This drug is generally reserved for patients with parkinsonian syndrome receiving levodopa/carbidopa who are experiencing symptom fluctuations and are not responding adequately to or are not candidates for other adjunctive therapies.Tolcapone is a drug that inhibits the enzyme catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT). It is a yellow, odorless, non-hygroscopic, crystalline compound. In humans, COMT is distributed throughout various organs. When tolcapone is given in conjunction with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbidopa, plasma levels of levodopa are more sustained than after administration of levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor alone. It is believed that these sustained plasma levels of levodopa result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, leading to greater effects on the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease in patients as well as increased levodopa adverse effects, sometimes requiring a decrease in the dose of levodopa.The precise mechanism of action of tolcapone is unknown, but it is believed to be related to its ability to inhibit COMT and alter the plasma pharmacokinetics of levodopa, resulting in an increase in plasma levodopa concentrations."
162,"For the ophthalmic treatment of corticosteroid-responsive inflammation of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea and anterior segment of the globe.A glucocorticoid employed, usually as eye drops, in the treatment of allergic and inflammatory conditions of the eye. It has also been used topically in the treatment of various skin disorders. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p732)Corticosteroids such as fluorometholone inhibit the inflammatory response to a variety of inciting agents and probably delay or slow healing. They inhibit the edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation associated with inflammation.There is no generally accepted explanation for the mechanism of action of ocular corticosteroids. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2."
163,"The body needs calcium to make strong bones. Calcium is also needed for the heart, muscles, and nervous system to work properly.Calcium supplements such as calcium gluceptate are taken by individuals who are unable to get enough calcium in their regular diet or who have a need for more calcium. The body needs calcium to make strong bones. They are continuously giving up calcium to the bloodstream and then replacing it as the body's need for calcium changes from day to day. When there is not enough calcium in the blood to be used by the heart and other organs, your body will take the needed calcium from the bones."
164,"The pharmacological effect of indometacin is not fully understood, however, it is thought to be mediated through potent and nonselective inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), which is the main enzyme responsible for catalyzes the rate-limiting step in prostaglandin and thromboxane biosynthesis via the arachidonic acid (AA) pathway. Since then, indometacin has been extensively studied in clinical trials as one of the most potent NSAIDs in blocking prostaglandin synthesis and was among the first NSAIDs to be used in the symptomatic treatment of migraine and for headaches that eventually became known as “indomethacin-responsive�?headache disorders. Most commonly used in rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritis, acute shoulder pains, and acute gouty arthritis, indometacin is currently available as oral capsules as well as other methods of administration, including rectal and intravenous formulations. Although deemed effective in reducing ocular inflammation in clinical studies, topical NSAIDs were also associated with a potential reduction in corneal sensitivity accompanied by an increased risk of superficial punctate keratitis and subjective symptoms of discomfort, including pain, burning or pricking, or a tingling sensation after instillation into the cul‐de‐sac.Indometacin is an NSAID with analgesic and antipyretic properties that exerts its pharmacological effects by inhibiting the synthesis of factors involved in pain, fever, and inflammation. The exact mechanism of action of indometacin in inducing closure of a patent ductus arteriosus is not fully understood; however, it is thought to be through inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis."
165,"Ethambutol was first described in the literature in 1961. It has a long duration of action as it is administered daily, and a moderate therapeutic window. Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of optic neuritis and hepatic toxicity.Ethambutol diffuses into _Mycobacterium_ cells. Once inside the cell, ethambutol inhibits the arabinosyltransferases (embA, embB, and embC), preventing formation of the cell wall components arabinogalactan and lipoarabinomannan, and preventing cell division. Lipoarabinomannan is a component of a cell surface molecule involved in the interaction with host cells."
166,"Fasting plasma glucose is also a useful and important measure of glycemic control. Metformin decreases blood glucose levels by decreasing hepatic glucose production (also called gluconeogenesis), decreasing the intestinal absorption of glucose, and increasing insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. It is well established that metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I activity, and it has since been generally postulated that its potent antidiabetic effects occur through this mechanism. The above processes lead to a decrease in blood glucose, managing type II diabetes and exerting positive effects on glycemic control. In addition to the above pathway, the mechanism of action of metformin may be explained by other ways, and its exact mechanism of action has been under extensive study in recent years."
167,"Methadone is also indicated for detoxification treatment of opioid addiction (heroin or other morphine-like drugs), and for maintenance substitution treatment for opioid dependence in adults in conjunction with appropriate social and medical services.Methadone is a potent synthetic analgesic that works as a full µ-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. Methadone shares similar effects and risks of other opioids such as , , , and . These effects make methadone a good option for the treatment of severe pain and addiction as fewer doses are needed to maintain analgesia and prevent opioid withdrawal symptoms. Deaths have been reported during conversion from chronic, high-dose treatment with other opioid agonists. While agonism of the µ-opioid receptor is the primary mechanism of action for the treatment of pain, methadone also acts as an agonist of κ- and σ-opioid receptors within the central and peripheral nervous systems."
168,"Olanzapine is also approved for the management of psychomotor agitation associated with schizophrenia and bipolar I mania. This characteristic significantly reduces the presence of side effects. Clinical trials for the original use of olanzapine demonstrated significant effectiveness in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in adults and acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar disorder in adolescents. In a high-level study of the effect of olanzapine for this condition, a complete response on the delay phase was observed in 84% of the individual and control of emesis of over 80% despite the phase.The activity of olanzapine is achieved by the antagonism of multiple neuronal receptors including the dopamine receptor D1, D2, D3 and D4 in the brain, the serotonin receptors 5HT2A, 5HT2C, 5HT3 and 5HT6, the alpha-1 adrenergic receptor, the histamine receptor H1 and multiple muscarinic receptors. The binding of olanzapine to the dopamine D2 receptors is easily dissociable and hence, it allows for a certain degree of dopamine neurotransmission."
169,"2) Management of heart failure. The use of atenolol may need to be based on more patient factors than hypertension alone.Atenolol is a cardio-selective beta-blocker and as such exerts most of its effects on the heart. It acts as an antagonist to sympathetic innervation and prevents increases in heart rate, electrical conductivity, and contractility in the heart due to increased release of norepinephrine from the peripheral nervous system. The effects of atenolol on blood pressure have been established, although it is less effective than alternative beta-blockers, but the mechanism has not yet been characterized. Unlike some other beta-blocker drugs, atenolol does not have intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilizing activity nor does it produce changes in glycemic control.Atenolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker, called such because it selectively binds to the β1-adrenergic receptor as an antagonist up to a reported 26 fold more than β2 receptors."
170,"Omeprazole, according to the FDA label  is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) used for the following purposes:    �?Treatment of active duodenal ulcer in adults     �?Eradication of Helicobacter pylori to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer  recurrence in adults     �?Treatment of active benign gastric ulcer in adults     �?Reduction of risk of upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding in critically ill adult patients. **Effects on gastric acid secretion**    This drug decreases gastric acid secretion . **Effects on serum gastrin**    In studies of 200 or more patients, serum gastrin levels increased during the first 1-2 weeks of daily administration of therapeutic doses of omeprazole. Omeprazole is a member of a class of antisecretory compounds, the substituted _benzimidazoles_, that stop gastric acid secretion by selective inhibition of the _H+/K+ ATPase_ enzyme system. The treatment of H. pylori infection may include the addition of omeprazole or other proton pump inhibitors as part of the treatment regimen , ."
171,"In vitro and in vivo, the drug is active only at a slightly acid pH. This interferes with the bacteriums ability to synthesize new fatty acids, required for growth and replication.Pyrazinamide diffuses into active _M. Pyrazinoic acid was thought to inhibit the enzyme fatty acid synthase (FAS) I, which is required by the bacterium to synthesise fatty acids. However, further studies reproduced the results of FAS I inhibition as the putative mechanism first in whole cell assay of replicating M. tuberculosis bacilli which have shown that pyrazinoic acid and its ester inhibit the synthesis of fatty acids. This study was followed by in vitro assay of tuberculous FAS I enzyme that tested the activity with pyrazinamide, pyrazinoic acid and several classes of pyrazinamide analogs."
172,"Used for the symptomatic treatment of parkinsonism.Metixene (or methixene) is a anticholinergic used as an antiparkinsonian agent.Metixene is a tertiary antimuscarinic with actions similar to those of atropine; it also has antihistaminic and direct antispasmodic properties. It is used for the symptomatic treatment of parkinsonism, including the alleviation of the extrapyramidal syndrome induced by other drugs such as phenothiazines, but, like other antimuscarinics, it is of no value against tardive dyskinesias. Metixene has been discontinued.Parkinsonism is thought to result from an imbalance between the excitatory (cholinergic) and inhibitory (dopaminergic) systems in the corpus striatum. The mechanism of action of centrally active anticholinergic drugs such as metixene is considered to relate to competitive antagonism of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors in the corpus striatum, which then restores the balance."
173,"For the treatment of allergic rhinitis, hay fever, and allergic skin disorders.In the U.S., Terfenadine was superseded by fexofenadine in the 1990s due to the risk of cardiac arrhythmia caused by QT interval prolongation.Terfenadine, an H1-receptor antagonist antihistamine, is similar in structure to astemizole and haloperidol, a butyrophenone antipsychotic. The active metabolite of terfenadine is fexofenadine.Terfenadine competes with histamine for binding at H1-receptor sites in the GI tract, uterus, large blood vessels, and bronchial muscle. This reversible binding of terfenadine to H1-receptors suppresses the formation of edema, flare, and pruritus resulting from histaminic activity. As the drug does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier, CNS depression is minimal."
174,"Being a potent vasodilator, diltiazem is used clinically as an antihypertensive, anti-arrhythmic, and as an anti-anginal agent  for the management of cardiovascular conditions such as hypertension, chronic stable angina, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter. As the magnitude of blood pressure reduction is related to the degree of hypertension, the antihypertensive effect of diltiazem is most pronounced in individuals with hypertension. It is proposed that this cation influx may also trigger the release of additional calcium ions from intracellular storage sites. Through its actions on reducing calcium levels in cardiac and vascular smooth muscles, diltiazem causes a reduction in the contractile processes of the myocardial smooth muscle cells and vasodilation of the coronary and systemic arteries, including epicardial and subendocardial. Diltiazem lowers myocardial oxygen demand through a reduction in heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac contractility; this leads to a therapeutic effect in improving exercise tolerance in chronic stable angina."
175,"In depressed individuals, protriptyline exerts a positive effect on mood. TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. The antidepressant effects of TCAs are thought to be due to an overall increase in serotonergic neurotransmission. TCAs also block histamine H1 receptors, alpha1-adrenergic receptors and muscarinic receptors, which accounts for their sedative, hypotensive and anticholinergic effects (e.g. blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention), respectively.Protriptyline may be used for the treatment of depression.Protriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant. The effectiveness of antidepressants appear after approximately two weeks following recommended adminsitration schedule."
176,"Alfuzosin is used to treat the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The prevalence of BPH is as high as 50%-60% for males in their 60's, and this prevalence increases to 80%-90% of those over 70. It was initially approved by the FDA in 2003 and is marketed by several pharmaceutical companies.By selectively inhibiting alpha adrenergic receptors in the lower urinary tract, alfuzosin causes smooth muscle relaxation in the bladder neck and prostate, improving urine flow, thereby reducing BPH symptoms. Additionally, alfuzosin reduces the vasoconstrictor effect of catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine), leading to peripheral vasodilation. This leads to the relaxation of smooth muscle in both the prostate and bladder neck, resulting in the improvement in urine flow and a reduction of urinary symptoms."
177,"Used in the control of absence (petit mal) seizures that are refractory to treatment with other medications.An anticonvulsant effective in absence seizures, but generally reserved for refractory cases because of its toxicity. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1994, p378)Paramethadione and trimethadione are anticonvulsants indicated in the control of absence (petit mal) seizures that are refractory to treatment with other medications. Dione anticonvulsants are used in the treatment of epilepsy. They act on the central nervous system (CNS) to reduce the number of seizures.Dione anticonvulsants reduce T-type calcium currents in thalamic neurons, including thalamic relay neurons. It does so via the inhibition of voltage dependent T-type calcium channels."
178,"Clobazam is indicated for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients 2 years of age or older. Clobazam belongs to the 1,5-benzodiazepine class of drugs and is marketed under different names, Onfi, Frisium, Urbanyl, and others.. Clobazam was first synthesized in 1966 and first published in 1969, following the incidental synthesis and discovery of the first benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide in the 1950s. Unlike older 1,4-benzodiazepines, clobazam has a better side-effects profile, particularly less sedative and amnesic effects. Specifically, clobazam binds to the interface of the α<sub>2</sub> and γ<sub>2</sub>-subunit of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor. It has a great affinity for the α<sub>2</sub> subunit than the α<sub>1</sub> subunit compared to other 1,4‐benzodiazepines.Binding of clobazam to the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor causes chloride channels to open, resulting in an influx of chloride and thus hyperpolarization of neurons."
179,"For the treatment of severe hypertension and in the topical treatment (regrowth) of androgenic alopecia in males and females and stabilisation of hair loss in patients with androgenic alopecia.A potent direct-acting peripheral vasodilator (vasodilator agents) that reduces peripheral resistance and produces a fall in blood pressure.Minoxidil is an orally effective direct acting peripheral vasodilator that reduces elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure by decreasing peripheral vascular resistance. Minoxidil is also used topically to treat androgenetic alopecia. In man, forearm and renal vascular resistance decline; forearm blood flow increases while renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate are preserved. The predominant site of minoxidil action is arterial. The antihypertensive activity of minoxidil is due to its sulphate metabolite, minoxidil sulfate.Minoxidil is thought to promote the survival of human dermal papillary cells (DPCs) or hair cells by activating both extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt and by preventing cell death by increasing the ratio of BCl-2/Bax."
180,"As the acetate, it is more potent than progesterone both as a progestagen and as an ovulation inhibitor. It has also been used in the palliative treatment of breast cancer.Megestrol is a synthetic progestin and has the same physiologic effects as natural progesterone. Mestrogel has slight glucocorticoid activity and very slight mineralocorticoid activity. Initially developed as a contraceptive, it was first evaluated in breast cancer treatment in 1967.The precise mechanism by which megestrol acetate produces effects in anorexia and cachexia is unknown at the present time, but its progestin antitumour activity may involve suppression of luteinizing hormone by inhibition of pituitary function. It has also been suggested that megestrol may alter metabolic pathyways via interferences with the production or action of mediators such as cachectin, a hormone that inhibits adipocyte lipogenic enzymes."
181,"For remission induction and remission consolidation treatment of acute nonlymphocytic leukemias.An antineoplastic compound which also has antimetabolite action. TGMP interferes with the synthesis of guanine nucleotides by its inhibition of purine biosynthesis by pseudofeedback inhibition of glutamine-5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase, the first enzyme unique to the de novo pathway of purine ribonucleotide synthesis. Thioguanine nucleotides are incorporated into both the DNA and the RNA by phosphodiester linkages, and some studies have shown that incorporation of such false bases contributes to the cytotoxicity of thioguanine. Its tumor inhibitory properties may be due to one or more of its effects on feedback inhibition of de novo purine synthesis; inhibition of purine nucleotide interconversions; or incorporation into the DNA and RNA. The overall result of its action is a sequential blockade of the utilization and synthesis of the purine nucleotides."
182,"For the prevention and control of excessive bleeding following vaginal childbirthA homolog of ergonovine containing one more CH2 group. (Merck Index, 11th ed)Methylergometrine is a semisynthetic ergot alkaloid and a derivative of ergonovine and is used for the prevention and control of postpartum and post-abortion hemorrhage. In general, the effects of all the ergot alkaloids appear to results from their actions as partial agonists or antagonists at adrenergic, dopaminergic, and tryptaminergic receptors. The spectrum of effects depends on the agent, dosage, species, tissue, and experimental or physiological conditions. All of the alkaloids of ergot significantly increase the motor activity of the uterus."
183,"For prevention and treatment of nausea, vomiting, and dizziness associated with motion sickness and vertigo (dizziness caused by other medical problems).Buclizine is an antihistamine medication with both antiemetic and anticholinergic effects , belonging to the _piperazine derivative_ family of drugs. Buclizine is used in the prevention and treatment of nausea, vomiting, and dizziness associated with motion sickness. The vomiting centre possesses neurons which are rich in muscarinic cholinergic and histamine containing synapses. These types of neurons are especially involved in transmission from the vestibular apparatus to the vomiting centre. Hence the action of buclizine which acts to block the histamine receptors in the vomiting centre and thus reduce activity along these pathways."
184,"Aztreonam exhibits potent and specific activity in vitro against a wide spectrum of gram-negative aerobic pathogens including <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. It has no useful activity against gram-positive bacteria or anaerobes, but has very broad spectrum against gram-negative aerobes, including <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. Aztreonam, unlike the majority of beta-lactam antibiotics, does not induce beta-lactamase activity and its molecular structure confers a high degree of resistance to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases (such as penicillinases and cephalosporinases) produced by most gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens; it is, therefore, usually active against gram-negative aerobic microorganisms that are resistant to antibiotics hydrolyzed by beta-lactamases. Aztreonam maintains its antimicrobial activity over a pH range of 6 to 8 in vitro, as well as in the presence of human serum and under anaerobic conditions.The bactericidal action of aztreonam results from the inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis due to a high affinity of aztreonam for penicillin binding protein 3 (PBP3). It is possible that aztreonam interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."
185,"For the relief of discomfort associated with acute painful musculoskeletal conditions.A centrally acting central muscle relaxant with sedative properties. It is claimed to inhibit muscle spasm by exerting an effect primarily at the level of the spinal cord and subcortical areas of the brain. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoea, 30th ed, p1202)Chlorzoxazone is a centrally-acting agent for painful musculoskeletal conditions. The clinical result is a reduction of the skeletal muscle spasm with relief of pain and increased mobility of the involved muscles.Chlorzoxazone inhibits degranulation of mast cells, subsequently preventing the release of histamine and slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A), mediators of type I allergic reactions. Chlorzoxazone also may reduce the release of inflammatory leukotrienes."
186,"Mefloquine is also indicated for the prophylaxis of malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, including chloroquine-resistant forms of Plasmodium falciparum. Malaria is a protozoan disease that places an enormous burden on human health in endemic areas around the world. The 2020 World Health Organization malaria report indicates a 60% decrease in the global malaria fatality rate between 2000 to 2019. Despite this, malaria remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality; 90% of deaths from malaria occur in Africa. Mefloquine, commonly known as Lariam, is an antimalarial drug used for the prevention and treatment of malaria caused by infection with Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum."
187,"The sulfonamides are synthetic bacteriostatic antibiotics with a wide spectrum against most gram-positive and many gram-negative organisms. However, many strains of an individual species may be resistant. Bacterial sensitivity is the same for the various sulfonamides, and resistance to one sulfonamide indicates resistance to all. Most sulfonamides are readily absorbed orally. Their antibacterial action is inhibited by pus.Sulfadiazine is a competitive inhibitor of the bacterial enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase."
188,"Vinorelbine tartrate is indicated for adults in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as a single therapy or in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs . Vinorelbine is an anti-mitotic chemotherapy drug that is used in the treatment of several types of malignancies, including breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) . This structural modification contributes to unique pharmacologic properties.The antitumor activity of vinorelbine tartrate is believed to be owed to the inhibition of mitosis at metaphase via its interaction with tubulin . Vinorelbine is a mitotic spindle poison that interferes with chromosomal segregation during mitosis, also known as cell division. Microtubules, which are derived from polymers of tubulin, are the main target of vinorelbine."
189,"Due to its severe adverse effects profile, clozapine is only available through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Clozapine REMS Program.Clozapine is a psychotropic agent belonging to the chemical class of benzisoxazole derivatives that is universally regarded as the treatment of choice for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Although it is thought to mediate its pharmacological effect through antagonism of the dopamine type 2 (D<sub>2) and the serotonin type 2A (5-HT2A>) receptors, research have shown that clozapine can act on various types of receptors. Testing is initially completed at one-week intervals but is expanded to two-week intervals at six months, and then four-week intervals at twelve months if lab results have been within an appropriate range. If myocarditis occurs, the patient should not be re-challenged with clozapine. Antagonism at receptors other than dopamine and 5HT2 with similar receptor affinities may explain some of the other therapeutic and side effects of clozapine."
190,"Histamine H1 antagonist with pronounced sedative properties. Doxylamine has also been administered in veterinary applications and was formerly used in parkinsonism.Doxylamine is an antihistamine commonly used as a sleep aid. Doxylamine is a member of the ethanolamine class of antihistamines and has anti-allergy power far superior to virtually every other antihistamine on the market, with the exception of diphenhydramine (Benadryl). Doxylamine is also a potent anticholinergic.Like other antihistamines, doxylamine acts by competitively inhibiting histamine at H1&nbsp;receptors. It also has substantial sedative and anticholinergic effects."
191,"This levonorgestrel-only form of contraception is not indicated for regular contraception and must be taken as soon as possible within 72 hours after intercourse. Also known as Plan B, it is used as a single agent in emergency contraception, and as a hormonal contraceptive released from an intrauterine device, commonly referred to as an IUD. The levonorgestrel-only containing emergency contraceptive tablet is 89% effective if it is used according to prescribing information within 72 hours after intercourse. Levonorgestrel has been proven to be more effective when administered before ovulation. Interestingly, recent evidence has refuted the commonly believed notion that levonorgestrel changes the consistency of cervical mucus when it is taken over a short-term period, as in emergency contraception."
192,Mainly used to treat patients in vasodilatory shock states such as septic shock and neurogenic shock and has shown a survival benefit over dopamine. Also used as a vasopressor medication for patients with critical hypotension.Precursor of epinephrine that is secreted by the adrenal medulla and is a widespread central and autonomic neurotransmitter. Norepinephrine is the principal transmitter of most postganglionic sympathetic fibers and of the diffuse projection system in the brain arising from the locus ceruleus. It is also found in plants and is used pharmacologically as a sympathomimetic.Noradrenaline acts on both alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors to cause vasoconstriction. Its effect in-vitro is often limited to the increasing of blood pressure through antagonising alpha-1 and alpha-2 receptors and causing a resultant increase in systemic vascular resistance.Norepinephrine functions as a peripheral vasoconstrictor by acting on alpha-adrenergic receptors.
193,"In addition to its beneficial effects in depression, mirtazapine has been reported to be efficacious in the off-label management of various other conditions. In a clinical trial, women with depression experienced a clinically significant mean increase in body weight, fat mass, and concentrations of leptin when treated with mirtazapine for a 6-week period, with a lack of effect on glucose homeostasis. **Summary**    The mechanism of action of mirtazapine is not fully understood but may be explained by its effects on central adrenergic and serotonergic activity. **Effects on various receptors**    It has been shown that both noradrenergic and serotonergic activity increase following mirtazapine administration. The pain-relieving effects of mirtazapine may be explained by its effects on opioid receptors."
194,"It is used in the treatment of anxiety disorders, and also for the short-term management of insomnia but has largely been superseded by the benzodiazepines. Meprobamate has most of the pharmacological effects and dangers of the barbiturates (though it was marketed as being safer) but it is less sedating at effective doses. Meprobamate exhibits some anticonvulsant effects in absence seizures; however, it is reported to potentially exacerbate generalized tonic-clonic seizures. However, its is currently only licensed as an anxiolytic and it is a third or fourth-order choice.Meprobamate's mechanism of action is not fully understood; in animal studies, meprobamate is reported to act at multiple sites in the central nervous system, such as the thalamus and limbic system. It binds to the GABAA receptors, leading to inhibitory effects on the neurons transmitting signals in the reticular formation and spinal cord."
195,"For the treatment or relief of nausea and vomiting.A dopamine antagonist that is particularly useful in treating the nausea and vomiting associated with anesthesia, mildly emetic cancer chemotherapy agents, radiation therapy, and toxins. This piperazine phenothiazine does not prevent vertigo or motion sickness. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1994, p457)Thiethylperazine, an atypical antipsychotic agent, is used to treat both negative and positive symptoms of schizophrenia, acute mania with bipolar disorder, agitation, and psychotic symptoms in dementia. Future uses may include the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder and severe behavioral disorders in autism. Structurally and pharmacologically similar to clozapine, Thiethylperazine binds to alpha(1), dopamine, histamine H1, muscarinic, and serotonin type 2 (5-HT2) receptors.Thiethylperazine is an antagonist at types 1, 2, and 4 dopamine receptors, 5-HT receptor types 2A and 2C, muscarinic receptors 1 through 5, alpha(1)-receptors, and histamine H1-receptors."
196,"Tihexyphenidyl is indicated as an adjunct in the treatment of parkinsonism, an adjuvant in the treatment of parkinsonism with levodopa, and in the control of extrapyramidal disorders caused by central nervous system drugs.Trihexyphenidyl is a centrally acting muscarinic antagonist used for treatment of parkinsonism and drug-induced extrapyramidal disorders. Its discovery was published in 1949 in a study looking for drugs with antispasmodic activity. Trihexyphenidyl was granted FDA approval on 13 May 1949.Trihexyphenidyl is an antimuscarinic indicated as an adjunct in the treatment of parkinsonism or as a treatment for drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms. It has a long duration of action as it does not need to be given every day. Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of anhidrosis and hyperthermia.Trihexyphenidyl is a non-selective muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist but binds with higher affinity to the M1 subtype."
197,"For the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, as well as prevention of acute nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy. It is the most effective of the 5-HT3 antagonists in controlling delayed CINV nausea and vomiting that appear more than 24 hours after the first dose of a course of chemotherapy and is the only drug of its class approved for this use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The serotonin then stimulates the vagal and splanchnic nerve receptors that project to the medullary vomiting center, as well as the 5-HT3 receptors in the area postrema, thus initiating the vomiting reflex, causing nausea and vomiting.Palonosetron is a selective serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. The antiemetic activity of the drug is brought about through the inhibition of 5-HT3 receptors present both centrally (medullary chemoreceptor zone) and peripherally (GI tract). It has been hypothesized that palonosetron's potency and long plasma half-life may contribute to its observed efficacy in preventing delayed nausea and vomiting caused by moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy."
198,"Also used to prevent natural abortion in patients who have a history of habitual abortions.A synthetic progestational hormone with no androgenic or estrogenic properties. Unlike many other progestational compounds, dydrogesterone produces no increase in temperature and does not inhibit ovulation.Dydrogesterone is an orally active progestogen which acts directly on the uterus, producing a complete secretory endometrium in an estrogen-primed uterus. At therapeutic levels, dydrogesterone has no contraceptive effect as it does not inhibit or interfere with ovulation or the corpus luteum. Furthermore, dydrogesterone is non-androgenic, non-estrogenic, non-corticoid, non-anabolic and is not excreted as pregnanediol. Therefore, it may be useful in the treatment of menstrual disorders such as absent, irregular or painful menstrual periods, infertility, premenstrual syndrome and endometriosis.Dydrogesterone is a progestogen that works by regulating the healthy growth and normal shedding of the womb lining by acting on progesterone receptors in the uterus."
199,"The Food and Drug Administration has designated dexrazoxane as an orphan drug for use in the prevention or reduction in the incidence and severity of anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy.Dexrazoxane is a cardioprotective agent for use in conjunction with doxorubicin indicated for reducing the incidence and severity of cardiomyopathy associated with doxorubicin administration in women with metastatic breast cancer who have received a cumulative doxorubicin dose. Although the exact mechanism of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is not known, it has shown to exert a variety of actions that may result in the development of cardiotoxicity. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the main cause of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is associated with free-radical damage to DNA. Chelation of metal ions, particularly iron, by anthracyclines results in an anthracycline-metal complex that catalyzes the generation of reactive oxygen free radicals. Results of laboratory studies suggest that dexrazoxane (a prodrug) is converted intracellularly to a ring-opened bidentate chelating agent that chelates to free iron and interferes with iron-mediated free radical generation thought to be responsible, in part, for anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy."
200,"The option for single daily dosing of amlodipine is an attractive feature of this drug . Acute intravenous administration of amlodipine reduces arterial blood pressure and increases heart rate in patients with chronic stable angina, however, chronic oral administration of amlodipine in clinical studies did not cause clinically significant alterations in heart rate or blood pressures in patients diagnosed with angina and normal blood pressure. In clinical trials in which amlodipine was given in combination with beta-blockers to patients diagnosed with hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic parameters were noted. **Mechanism of action on blood pressure**    Amlodipine is considered a peripheral arterial vasodilator that exerts its action directly on vascular smooth muscle to lead to a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance, causing a decrease in blood pressure. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (calcium ion antagonist or slow-channel blocker) that inhibits the influx of calcium ions into both vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle."
201,"For the palliative treatment of mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer's type.A centerally active cholinesterase inhibitor that has been used to counter the effects of muscle relaxants, as a respiratory stimulant, and in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other central nervous system disorders. An early pathophysiological feature of Alzheimer's disease that is associated with memory loss and cognitive deficits is a deficiency of acetylcholine as a result of selective loss of cholinergic neurons in the cerebral cortex, nucleus basalis, and hippocampus. This is accomplished by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses through reversible inhibition of its hydrolysis by acetylcholinesterase. If this proposed mechanism of action is correct, tacrine's effect may lessen as the disease progresses and fewer cholinergic neurons remain functionally intact. There is no evidence that tacrine alters the course of the underlying dementing process.The mechanism of tacrine is not fully known, but it is suggested that the drug is an anticholinesterase agent which reversibly binds with and inactivates cholinesterases."
202,"For the treatment of peptic ulcer disease and the relief of smooth muscle spasms in gastrointestinal disorders.Oxyphencyclimine is an anticholinergic drug (trade name Daricon) used in treating peptic ulcers.Oxyphencyclimine is a synthetic anticholinergic agent which has been shown in experimental and clinical studies to have a pronounced antispasmodic and antisecretory effect on the gastrointestinal tract. Oxyphencyclimine is an antimuscarinic, anticholinergic drug.Oxyphencyclimine binds the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. It may block all three types of muscarinic receptors including M-1 receptors in the CNS and ganglia, M-2 receptors in the heart (vagus) and M-3 receptors at the parasympathetic NEJ system. The muscarinic acetylcholine receptors mediate various cellular responses, including inhibition of adenylate cyclase, breakdown of phosphoinositides and modulation of potassium channels through the action of G proteins. Oxphencyclimine inhibits vagally mediated reflexes by antagonizing the action of acetylcholine."
203,"It works by promoting the excretion of sodium ions and water while decreasing the potassium excretion in the distal part of the nephron in the kidneys by working on the lumenal side. Currently, triamterene is used in the treatment of edema associated with various conditions as monotherapy and is approved for use with other diuretics to enhance diuretic and potassium-sparing effects. It is also found in a combination product with hydrochlorothiazide that is used for the management of hypertension or treatment of edema in patients who develop hypokalemia on hydrochlorothiazide alone.Triamterene, a relatively weak, potassium-sparing diuretic and antihypertensive, is used in the management of hypertension and edema. Triamterene exerts a diuretic effect on the distal renal tubule to inhibit the reabsorption of sodium ions in exchange for potassium and hydrogen ions and its natriuretic activity is limited by the amount of sodium reaching its site of action. Triamterene maintains or increases sodium excretion, thereby increasing the excretion of water, and reducing the excess loss of potassium, hydrogen, and chloride ions by inhibiting the distal tubular exchange mechanism."
204,"For the treatment of all forms of Parkinson's Disease, as well as control of extrapyramidal reactions induced by antipsychotic agents.A muscarinic antagonist that crosses the blood-brain barrier and is used in the treatment of drug-induced extrapyramidal disorders and in parkinsonism.Procyclidine has an atropine-like action on parasympathetic-innervated peripheral structures including smooth muscle. It's antispasmodic effects are thought to be related to the blockage of central cholinergic receptors M1, M2 and M4. It is used to treat symptomatic Parkinsonism and extrapyramidal dysfunction caused by antipsychotic agents.The mechanism of action is unknown. It is thought that Procyclidine acts by blocking central cholinergic receptors, and thus balancing cholinergic and dopaminergic activity in the basal ganglia. Procyclidine exerts an antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle, and may produce mydriasis and reduction in salivation."
205,"The ophthalmic formulation is indicated to induce mydriasis  and conjunctival vasoconstriction. Off-label uses include priapism and induction of local vasoconstriction.Phenylephrine is an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonist used to treat hypotension, dilate the pupil, and induce local vasoconstriction. The action of phenylephrine, or neo-synephrine, was first described in literature in the 1930s. Phenylephrine was granted FDA approval in 1939.Phenylephrine is an alpha-1 adrenergic agonist that raises blood pressure, dilates the pupils, and causes local vasoconstriction. Patients taking an intravenous formulation should be counselled regarding the risk of bradycardia, allergic reactions, extravasation causing necrosis or tissue sloughing, and the concomitant use of oxytocic drugs.Phenylephrine is an alpha-1 adrenergic agonist that mediates vasoconstriction and mydriasis depending on the route and location of administration."
206,"For the treatment of hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis. It is also used to prepare patients for thyroidectomy.An imidazole antithyroid agent. Carbimazole is metabolized to methimazole, which is responsible for the antithyroid activity.Carbimazole is a carbethoxy derivative of methimazole. Its antithyroid action is due to its conversion to methimazole after absorption. It is used to treat hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis.Carbimazole is an aitithyroid agent that decreases the uptake and concentration of inorganic iodine by thyroid, it also reduces the formation of di-iodotyrosine and thyroxine."
207,"3) To maintain control ventricular rate in adult patients diagnosed with chronic atrial fibrillation. It is a common agent used to manage atrial fibrillation and the symptoms of heart failure. They were one of the first to prescribe cardiac glycosides, according to ancient literature dating as early as the 1250s.Digoxin is a positive inotropic and negative chronotropic drug, meaning that it increases the force of the heartbeat and decreases the heart rate. Cardiac arrest as a result of ventricular fibrillation is fatal. Digoxin exerts hemodynamic, electrophysiologic, and neurohormonal effects on the cardiovascular system."
208,"Sulpiride is indicated for the treatment of acute and chronic schizophrenia.Sulpiride first appeared in published literature in 1967. Clinical studies show a greater effect on treating the negative symptoms of schizophrenia rather than positive symptoms at low doses, though the effects are more equal at higher doses. It has a short duration of action as it is given twice daily, and a wide therapeutic window as patients have survived single doses as high as 16g. Patients should be counselled regarding increased motor agitation, extrapyramidal reactions, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome.Sulpiride is a selective dopamine D2 and D3 receptor antagonist. It is estimated that D2 receptors should be 65-80% occupied for optimal treatment and minimal adverse effects."
209,"It is sold under the trade name Parsitan in Canada. In the US, the marketing of profenamine has been discontinued.Profenamine, a phenothiazine and antidyskinetic, is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Profenamine also has a slight antihistaminic and local anesthetic effect.Profenamine's anti-Parkinson action can be attributed to its anticholinergic properties. Profenamine's local anesthetic effect is due to its antagonism of the NMDA glutamate receptor. Glutamate is recognized as an important transmitter in nociceptive pathways, and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of the glutamate receptor, in particular, has been implicated in the mediation of neuropathic pain."
210,"For use as an adjunct to improve neurologic outcome following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) from ruptured intracranial berry aneurysms by reducing the incidence and severity of ischemic deficits.Nimodipine is a 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. By inhibiting the influx of calcium in smooth muscle cells, nimodipine prevents calcium-dependent smooth muscle contraction and subsequent vasoconstriction. Nimodipine inhibits calcium ion transfer into these cells and thus inhibits contractions of vascular smooth muscle. In animal experiments, nimodipine had a greater effect on cerebral arteries than on arteries elsewhere in the body perhaps because it is highly lipophilic, allowing it to cross the blood brain barrier. By specifically binding to L-type voltage-gated calcium channels, nimodipine inhibits the calcium ion transfer, resulting in the inhibition of vascular smooth muscle contraction."
211,"Indicated for the relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses in patients 13 years of age and older. Formulations for oral inhalation, intranasal, and topical use are available for beclomethasone dipropionate. When inhaled, it is proposed that beclomethasone dipropionate remains active locally in the lung without causing significant side effects associated with systemic corticosteroids. Although inhaled corticosteroids, including beclomethasone dipropionate, are reported to mainly act locally in the lungs, systemic effects such as disruption of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function, bone turnover, osteoporosis, and growth suppression may still be observed with chronic use or high dose administration. Corticosteroids were also shown to inhibit the expression of multiple genes that encode pro-inflammatory factors, such as cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules, that are activated during the chronic inflammatory process."
212,"**Important limitations of use** :    �?Should only be used for acute treatment periods up to two or three weeks     �?Adequate evidence of effectiveness for more prolonged use has not been established     �?Not recommended in pediatric patients less than 16 years of ageOriginally approved by the FDA in 1959 , carisoprodol is a centrally acting muscle relaxant used in painful musculoskeletal conditions in conjunction with physical therapy and other medications . In January 2012, this drug was classified as a Schedule IV substance under the controlled substances act in several US states due to alarming rates of abuse  despite having a low potential for abuse in addition to a low risk of dependence .Carisoprodol is a centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant that does not act directly on skeletal muscle but acts directly on the central nervous system (CNS). Clinical studies have shown that this drug causes impairment of psychomotor performance in neuropsychological tests.The mechanism of action of carisoprodol in relieving discomfort associated with acute painful musculoskeletal conditions has not been confirmed. This drug has been shown to modulate a variety of GABAA receptor subunits. GABAA receptor modulation can lead to anxiolysis due to inhibitory effects on neurotransmission."
213,"The lower concentration progesterone gel (4%) is used in the treatment of secondary amenorrhea, with the use of the 8% concentration if there is no therapeutic response to the 4% gel . **Vaginal insert**    This form is indicated to support embryo implantation and early pregnancy by supplementation of corpus luteal function as part of an Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) treatment program for infertile women . Progesterone is used in various contraceptive preparations to prevent ovulation and fertilization ,  as well as in other formulations to promote and support pregnancy. It acts on the uterus by changing the proliferative phase to the secretory phase of the endometrium (inner mucous lining of the uterus). This hormone, stimulated by a hormone called _luteinizing hormone_ (LH) is the main hormone during the secretory phase to prepare the corpus luteum and the endometrium for implantation of a fertilized ovum."
214,"Sorafenib is indicated for the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and advanced renal cell carcinoma. It targets cell surface tyrosine kinase receptors and downstream intracellular kinases that are implicated in tumour cell proliferation and tumour angiogenesis. First approved by the FDA and European Commission in 2007 for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, sorafenib is also indicated to treat renal carcinoma and differentiated thyroid carcinoma.Sorafenib decreases tumour cell proliferation _in vitro_. It attenuated tumour growth of human tumour xenografts in immunocompromised mice, reduced tumour angiogenesis, and increased tumour apoptosis in models of hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, and differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Some studies suggest that sorafenib induces apoptosis in several tumour cell lines, although this effect is inconsistent across cell lines."
215,"Zoledronic acid is also indicated for the prevention of osteoporosis in post menopausal women and glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis.Zoledronic acid, or CGP 42'446, is a third generation, nitrogen containing bisphosphonate similar to , , and . Zoledronic acid was granted FDA approval on 20 August 2001.Zoledronic acid is a third generation, nitrogen containing bisphosphonate that inhibits osteoclast function and prevents bone resorption. Bone resorption by osteoclasts causes local acidification, releasing the bisphosphonate, which is taken into the osteoclast by fluid-phase endocytosis. Endocytic vesicles become acidified, releasing bisphosphonates into the cytosol of osteoclasts where they act. Disruption of the podosomes causes osteoclasts to detach from bones, preventing bone resorption."
216,"Griseofulvin may be given by mouth in the treatment of tinea infections.Griseofulvin is a mycotoxic metabolic product of Penicillium spp.It was the first available oral agent for the treatment of dermatophytoses and has now been used for more than forty years. Griseofulvin is fungistatic with in vitro activity against various species of Microsporum Epidermophyton, and Trichophyton. It has no effect on bacteria or on other genera of fungi. Once the keratin-Griseofulvin complex reaches the skin site of action, it binds to fungal microtubules (tubulin) thus altering fungal mitosis.Griseofulvin is fungistatic, however the exact mechanism by which it inhibits the growth of dermatophytes is not clear. It binds to keratin in human cells, then once it reaches the fungal site of action, it binds to fungal microtubes thus altering the fungal process of mitosis."
217,"For the treatment of hypertension.Nisoldipine is a 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. It acts primarily on vascular smooth muscle cells by stabilizing voltage-gated L-type calcium channels in their inactive conformation. Nisoldipine may be used in alone or in combination with other agents in the management of hypertension.Nisoldipine, a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker, is used alone or with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, to treat hypertension, chronic stable angina pectoris, and Prinzmetal's variant angina. Nisoldipine is similar to other peripheral vasodilators. Nisoldipine inhibits the influx of extra cellular calcium across the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes possibly by deforming the channel, inhibiting ion-control gating mechanisms, and/or interfering with the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum."
218,"Alprazolam was given FDA approval on October 16, 1981.Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine that binds γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type-A receptors (GABAARs) to enhance their inhibitory effect on neurotransmission, specifically in the brain; Patients with pre-existing impaired respiratory function are at increased risk of adverse effects including death during treatment with benzodiazepines. As CYP3A is required for the initial step in alprazolam metabolism, alprazolam is contraindicated in patients taking strong CYP3A inhibitors, such as ketoconazole and itraconazole; milder CYP3A inhibitors still necessitate alprazolam dosage adjustments. The most prevalent GABAARs _in vivo_ are the α1β2γ2 receptors, which contain both GABA (β+/α-) and benzodiazepine (BZD, α+/γ-) binding sites in the intersubunit interfaces of the relevant subunits. The binding of alprazolam in the high-affinity BZD site stabilizes the α+/γ- interface and facilitates the conformational changes that lead to pore opening, hence functioning as a positive allosteric modulator. Earlier studies suggested that the primary factor was the α subunit composition, with α1-containing receptors mediating the sedative effects, α2/3-containing receptors the anxiolytic effects, and α5-containing receptors the memory effects of benzodiazepines."
219,"For prevention of deep vein thrombosis, which may result in pulmonary embolism, following knee surgery.Ardeparin, marketed under the US trade name Normiflo, is a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) anticoagulant used for the prevention of postoperative venous thrombosis. Ardeparin is derived via peroxide degradation of heparin extracted from porcine intestinal mucosa. Its molecular weight ranges from 2000 to 15,000 with an average molecular weight of 5500 to 6500. It acts at multiple sites in the normal coagulation system to inhibit reactions that lead to the clotting of blood and the formation of fibrin clots both in vitro and in vivo.Ardeparin binds to antithrombin III, accelerating its activity in inactivating factor Xa and thrombin, thereby inhibiting thrombosis. Ardeparin does not effect prothrombin time (PT) assays and may prolong activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT)."
220,"For the management of the manifestations of psychotic disorders such as schizophreniaAn antipsychotic agent used in schizophrenia. Loxapine, a dibenzoxazepine compound, represents a subclass of tricyclic antipsychotic agents, chemically distinct from the thioxanthenes, butyrophenones, and phenothiazines. Pharmacologically, Loxapine is a tranquilizer for which the exact mode of action has not been established, however, it is believed that by antagonising dopamine and serotonin receptors, there is a marked cortical inhibition which can manifest as tranquilization and suppression of aggression.Loxapine is a dopamine antagonist, and also a serotonin 5-HT2 blocker. The exact mode of action of Loxapine has not been established, however changes in the level of excitability of subcortical inhibitory areas have been observed in several animal species in association with such manifestations of tranquilization as calming effects and suppression of aggressive behavior."
221,"Carbamoylcholine is indicated to induce miosis for surgery and to reduce intraocular pressure elevations in the first 24 hours after cataract surgery.Carbamoylcholine, also known as carbachol, is a muscarinic agonist discovered in 1932. Carbamoylcholine was initially used as a treatment for migraines, induction of diuresis, and other parasympathetic effects. Carbamoylcholine was granted FDA approval on 28 September 1972.Carbamoylcholine is a parasympathomimetic that acts as an agonist of muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. It is more resistant to hydrolysis by acetylcholinesterase than other choline esters leading to a longer duration of action, with significant effects 24 hours after administration. Data regarding the therapeutic index of carbamoylcholine is not readily available."
222,"Like other thiazolidinediones, the mechanism of action of rosiglitazone is by activation of the intracellular receptor class of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), specifically PPARγ. Rosiglitazone is a selective ligand of PPARγ, and has no PPARα-binding action. This is the subject of a clinical trial currently underway.When rosiglitazone is used as monotherapy, it is associated with increases in total cholesterol, LDL, and HDL. As a result, the LDL/HDL ratio peaked after 2 months of therapy and then appeared to decrease over time. Rosiglitazone acts as a highly selective and potent agonist at peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPAR) in target tissues for insulin action such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver."
223,"This drug can be administered as monotherapy or in conjunction with levodopa. In addition to the above FDA approval for Parkinson's Disease, pramipexole was also approved by the FDA in 2006 for the treatment of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) . The motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease occur partly due to a reduction of dopamine in the substantia nigra of the brain . The exact mechanism of action of pramipexole as a treatment for Parkinson's disease is unknown at this time. Pramipexole is considered a non-ergot dopamine agonist that shows specificity and strong activity at the D2 subfamily of dopamine receptors in vitro, binding selectively and dopamine D2 receptors and showing a preference for the dopamine D3 receptor subtype rather than other subtypes ."
224,"Acetohexamide has been discontinued in the US market.Acetohexamide is an intermediate-acting, first-generation oral sulfonylurea. It lowers blood sugar by stimulating the pancreatic beta cells to secrete insulin and by helping the body use insulin efficiently. Due to its primary action on the pancreatic beta cells, the drug is only effective when there are functional pancreatic beta cells that can produce insulin granules. Acetohexamide has one-third the potency of chlorpropamide, and twice the potency of tolbutamide; however, similar hypoglycemic efficacy occurs with equipotent dosage of sulfonylureas.Sulfonylureas such as acetohexamide bind to an ATP-dependent K+ channel on the cell membrane of pancreatic beta cells. This inhibits a tonic, hyperpolarizing outflux of potassium, which causes the electric potential over the membrane to become more positive."
225,"For treatment of infection (Respiratory, GI, UTI and meningitis) due to E. coli, P. mirabilis, enterococci, Shigella, S. typhosa and other Salmonella, nonpenicillinase-producing N. gononhoeae, H. influenzae, staphylococci, streptococci including streptocAmpicillin is a semi-synthetic derivative of penicillin that functions as an orally active broad-spectrum antibiotic.Ampicillin is a penicillin beta-lactam antibiotic used in the treatment of bacterial infections caused by susceptible, usually gram-positive, organisms. The name ""penicillin"" can either refer to several variants of penicillin available, or to the group of antibiotics derived from the penicillins. Ampicillin has <i>in vitro</i> activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The bactericidal activity of Ampicillin results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis and is mediated through Ampicillin binding to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). Ampicillin is stable against hydrolysis by a variety of beta-lactamases, including penicillinases, and cephalosporinases and extended spectrum beta-lactamases.By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, Ampicillin inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis."
226,"Indicated for the treatment of mild to moderately severe infections due to penicillin G­-sensitive microorganisms, with the use of bacteriological studies (including sensitivity tests) and clinical response. Phenoxymethylpenicillin may be used for the treatment of:     - mild to moderate infections of the upper respiratory tract, scarlet fever, and mild erysipelas caused by Streptococcus without bacteremia  - mild to moderately severe infections of the respiratory tract caused by Pneumococcus  - mild infections of the skin and soft tissues caused by penicillin G-sensitive Staphylococcus  - mild to moderately severe infections of the oropharynx caused by Fusospirochetosis, including Vincent’s gingivitis and pharyngitis, usually respond to oral penicillin therapy    **Off-label**    Indicated for use as prophylaxis against bacterial endocarditis in patients with congenital heart disease or rheumatic or other acquired valvular heart disease when they undergo dental procedures and surgical procedures of the upper respiratory tract.Phenoxymethylpenicillin is a narrow spectrum antibiotic also commonly referred to as Penicillin V or Penicillin VK. An orally active naturally penicillin, phenoxymethylpenicillin is used to treat mild to moderate infections in the respiratory tract, skin, and soft tissues caused by penicillin G­-sensitive microorganisms. Phenoxymethylpenicillin has also be used in some cases as prophylaxis against susceptible organisms. This disrupts the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis."
227,"For the Short-term treatment of intractable insomnia for patients habituated to barbituratesSecobarbital (marketed by Eli Lilly and Company under the brand names Seconal and Tuinal) is a barbiturate derivative drug with anaesthetic, anticonvulsant, sedative and hypnotic properties. It is commonly known as quinalbarbitone in the United Kingdom.Secobarbital, a barbiturate, is used for the induction of anesthesia prior to the use of other general anesthetic agents and for induction of anesthesia for short surgical, diagnostic, or therapeutic procedures associated with minimal painful stimuli. Little analgesia is conferred by barbiturates; their use in the presence of pain may result in excitation.Secobarbital binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl- ionopore at the GABAAreceptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl- ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged."
228,"Also used to treat agitation or restlessness in the elderly.A phenothiazine with actions similar to chlorpromazine but with less antipsychotic activity. When there is an excess amount of dopamine in the brain it causes over-stimulation of dopamine receptors. Promazine has weak extrapyramidal and autonomic side effects which lead to its use in the elderly, for restless or psychotic patients. Its anti-psychotic effect is also weaker and it is not useful in general psychiatry.Promazine is an antagonist at types 1, 2, and 4 dopamine receptors, 5-HT receptor types 2A and 2C, muscarinic receptors 1 through 5, alpha(1)-receptors, and histamine H1-receptors. Promazine's antipsychotic effect is due to antagonism at dopamine and serotonin type 2 receptors, with greater activity at serotonin 5-HT2 receptors than at dopamine type-2 receptors."
229,"Spironolactone is indicated for the treatment of the following conditions:    - NYHA Class III-IV heart failure and reduced ejection fraction to increase survival, manage edema, and reduce the need for hospitalization for heart failure. As spironolactone has antiandrogenic activity, its off-label uses include the treatment of hirsutism, female pattern hair loss, and adult acne vulgaris.Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic. It is indicated to treat several conditions, including heart failure, edema, hyperaldosteronism, and hypertension. Spironolactone was developed in 1957, marketed in 1959, and approved by the FDA on January 21, 1960.Spironolactone has a potassium-sparing diuretic effect. By binding to the mineralocorticoid receptor at the distal tubules and collecting duct, it causes sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion, increases vascular stiffness and remodelling, and activates pro-inflammatory pathways."
230,"Spironolactone is indicated for the treatment of the following conditions:    - NYHA Class III-IV heart failure and reduced ejection fraction to increase survival, manage edema, and reduce the need for hospitalization for heart failure. - Short-term preoperative treatment of patients with primary hyperaldosteronism.

Spironolactone was developed in 1957, marketed in 1959, and approved by the FDA on January 21, 1960.Spironolactone has a potassium-sparing diuretic effect. By binding to the mineralocorticoid receptor at the distal tubules and collecting duct, it causes sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion, increases vascular stiffness and remodelling, and activates pro-inflammatory pathways."
231,"In Canada, methocarbamol containing oral formulations are sold over the counter for pain associated with muscle spasm. However, if these combination formulations include codeine, they are prescription only.Methocarbamol was developed in the early 1950s as a treatment for muscle spasticity and the associated pain. It is a guaiacol glyceryl ether. In Canada, methocarbamol can be sold as an over the counter oral medicine at a lower dose that may be combined with  or . Methacarbamol has been shown to block spinal polysynaptic reflexes, decrease nerve transmission in spinal and supraspinal polysynaptic pathways, and prolong the refractory period of muscle cells."
232,"As a drug that is not FDA approved, hyscyamine has no official indications. Intravenous hysocyamine has been used to reduce gastric motility, reduce pancreatic pain and secretions, to facilitate imaging of the gastrointestinal tract, treat anticholinesterase toxicity, treat certain cases of partial heart block, improve visualization of the kidneys, and for symptomatic relief of biliary and renal colic. Intravenous hyoscyamine is also used pre-operatively to reduce secretions of the mouth and respiratory tract to facilitate intubation. It is commonly extracted from plants in the _Solanaceae_ or nightshade family. Patients should be counselled regarding the risks and signs of anticholinergic toxicity.Hyoscyamine competitively and non-selectively antagonises muscarinic receptors in the smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, sino-atrial node, atrioventricular node, exocrine nodes, gastrointestinal tract, and respiratory tract."
233,"For the treatment of acute herpes zoster (shingles). Also for the treatment or suppression of recurrent genital herpes in immunocompetent patients and treatment of recurrent mucocutaneous herpes simplex infections in HIV infected patients.Famciclovir, marketed as Famvir by Novartis, is a guanine analogue used to treat herpes virus infections. It is most commonly used to treat herpes zoster (shingles). Therefore, herpes viral DNA synthesis and replication are selectively inhibited.Famciclovir undergoes rapid biotransformation to the active antiviral compound penciclovir, which has inhibitory activity against herpes simplex virus types 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2) and varicella zoster virus (VZV). In cells infected with HSV-1, HSV-2 or VZV, viral thymidine kinase phosphorylates penciclovir to a monophosphate form that, in turn, is converted to penciclovir triphosphate by cellular kinases."
234,"Also used in combination with other agents for the symptomatic relief of symptoms associated with the common cold.First generation histamine H1 antagonist used in allergic rhinitis; asthma; and urticaria. It is a component of cough and cold medicines. It may cause drowsiness.In allergic reactions an allergen interacts with and cross-links surface IgE antibodies on mast cells and basophils. Once released, histamine can react with local or widespread tissues through histamine receptors. Triprolidine, is a histamine H1 antagonist that competes with histamine for the normal H1-receptor sites on effector cells of the gastrointestinal tract, blood vessels and respiratory tract."
235,"It is used as an antineoplastic agent and to induce diabetes in experimental animals.Streptozocin is an antitumour antibiotic consisting of a nitrosourea moiety interposed between a methyl group and a glucosamine. Streptozocin is indicated in the treatment of metastatic islet cell carcinoma of the pancreas. Streptozocin inhibits DNA synthesis in bacterial and mammalian cells. Although streptozocin inhibits the progression of cells into mitosis, no specific phase of the cell cycle is particularly sensitive to its lethal effects.Although its mechanism of action is not completely clear, streptozocin is known to inhibit DNA synthesis, interfere with biochemical reactions of NAD and NADH, and inhibit some enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis. Its activity appears to occur as a result of formation of methylcarbonium ions, which alkylate or bind with many intracellular molecular structures including nucleic acids."
236,Inadvertent or spontaneous rupture of membranes in the presence of a previable fetus and absence of adequate activity for expulsion. Also for the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony which has not responded to conventional methods of management.A nonsteroidal abortifacient agent that is effective in both the first and second trimesters of pregnancy.Carboprost tromethamine administered intramuscularly stimulates in the gravid uterus myometrial contractions similar to labor contractions at the end of a full term pregnancy. This activity may produce the vomiting or diarrhea or both that is common when carbo-prost tromethamine is used to terminate pregnancy and for use postpartum. In laboratory animals and also in humans carboprost tromethamine can elevate body temperature. In laboratory animals and also in humans carboprost tromethamine can elevate body temperature.
237,"For treatment of severe infections caused by susceptible bacteria such as P. aeruginosa.Cefpiramide is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic.Cefpiramide is a cephalosporin active against <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. It has a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. Cefpiramide works by inhibiting bacterial cell wall biosynthesis. The plasma half-lives of cefpiramide in rabbits, dogs, and rhesus monkeys were much longer than those of cefoperazone and cefazolin.The bactericidal activity of cefpiramide results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs)."
238,"The use of prochlorperazine for the management of generalized non-psychotic anxiety is typically not a first-line therapy and should be limited to doses of less than 20 mg per day or for shorter than 12 weeks. Prochlorperazine, also known as compazine, is a piperazine phenothiazine and first-generation antipsychotic drug that is used for the treatment of severe nausea and vomiting, as well as short-term management of psychotic disorders such as generalized non-psychotic anxiety and schizophrenia. It also exerts its anti-emetic actions via anti-dopaminergic effects, where it displays similar efficacy as ondansteron, a 5HT-3 receptor antagonist and anti-emetic, in preventing delayed nausea and vomiting. Inhibition of D2 receptor signaling results in the blockade of postsynaptic dopamine receptors in the mesolimbic system  and an increased dopamine turnover. Prochlorperazine exerts antiemetic effects and was shown to inhibit apomorphine-induced vomiting by blocking D2 dopamine receptors in the CTZ.."
239,"This gas is an important signaling molecule in the body of mammals including humans and is an extremely important intermediate in the chemical industry. Nitric oxide (NO) should not be confused with nitrous oxide (N2O), a general anaesthetic, or with nitrogen dioxide (NO2) which is another poisonous air pollutant. The nitric oxide molecule is a free radical, which is relevant to understanding its high reactivity. It reacts with the ozone in air to form nitrogen dioxide, signalled by the appearance of the reddish-brown color.Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) occurs as a primary developmental defect or as a condition secondary to other diseases such as meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS), pneumonia, sepsis, hyaline membrane disease, congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), and pulmonary hypoplasia. In these states, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is high, which results in hypoxemia secondary to right-to-left shunting of blood through the patent ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale."
240,"For the treatment of high blood pressure and management of edema related to heart failure.A thiazide diuretic with actions and uses similar to those of hydrochlorothiazide. Thiazides are often used to treat hypertension, but their hypotensive effects are not necessarily due to their diuretic activity. Thiazides cause vasodilation by activating calcium-activated potassium channels (large conductance) in vascular smooth muscles and inhibiting various carbonic anhydrases in vascular tissue.As a diuretic, bendroflumethiazide inhibits active chloride reabsorption at the early distal tubule via the Na-Cl cotransporter, resulting in an increase in the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water. Thiazides like bendroflumethiazide also inhibit sodium ion transport across the renal tubular epithelium through binding to the thiazide sensitive sodium-chloride transporter. The antihypertensive mechanism of bendroflumethiazide is less well understood although it may be mediated through its action on carbonic anhydrases in the smooth muscle or through its action on the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (KCa) channel, also found in the smooth muscle."
241,"Allopurinol is indicated in :    1) the management of patients with signs and symptoms of primary or secondary gout (acute attacks, tophi, joint destruction, uric acid lithiasis, and/or nephropathy). 2) the management of patients with leukemia, lymphoma and malignancies who are receiving cancer therapy which causes elevations of serum and urinary uric acid levels. Allopurinol and its active metabolite inhibit xanthine oxidase, the enzyme that converts hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid. Accompanying the reduction of serum uric acid by allopurinol is an increase in the serum and urine concentrations of hypoxanthine and xanthine (due to inhibition of xanthine oxidase). Although the levels of hypoxanthine and xanthine are found to be increased after allopurinol ingestion, the risk of deposition in renal tissues is less than that of uric acid, as they become more soluble and are rapidly excreted by the kidney ."
242,"In all cases, to mitigate the risk of bacterial resistance and preserve clinical efficacy, ceftazidime should only be used for infections that are confirmed or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacterial strains.Bacteria possess a cell wall comprising a glycopeptide polymer commonly known as peptidoglycan, which is synthesized and remodelled through the action of a family of enzymes known as ""penicillin-binding proteins"" (PBPs). β-lactam antibiotics, including cephalosporins, are PBP inhibitors that, through inhibition of essential PBPs, result in impaired cell wall homeostasis, loss of cell integrity, and ultimately bacterial cell death. Ceftazidime has confirmed activity against clinically relevant Gram-negative bacteria including _Citrobacter_ spp., _Enterobacter_ spp., _Klebsiella_ spp., _Proteus_ spp., _Serratia spp., _Escherichia coli_, _Haemophilus influenzae_, _Neisseria meningitidis_, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, and some Gram-positive bacteria including _Staphylococcus_ spp. There are also _in vitro_ data for ceftazidime efficacy against a wide variety of other bacteria, such as _Acinetobacter baumannii_ and _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_, but no clear clinical studies to support the use of ceftazidime for infections caused by these bacteria. _In vitro_ experiments in Gram-negative bacteria such as _Escherichia coli_, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, _Acinetobacter baumannii_, and _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ suggest that ceftazidime primarily binds to PBP3, with weaker binding to PBP1a/1b and PBP2 as well; although binding to other PBPs, such as PBP4, is detectable, the concentrations required are much greater than those achieved clinically."
243,"mirabilis_, and coagulase-negative _Staphylococcus_ species. Trimethoprim is available as an ophthalmic solution in combination with  for the treatment of acute bacterial conjunctivitis, blepharitis, and blepharoconjunctivitis caused by susceptible bacteria.Trimethoprim is an antifolate antibacterial agent that inhibits bacterial dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), a critical enzyme that catalyzes the formation of tetrahydrofolic acid (THF) - in doing so, it prevents the synthesis of bacterial DNA and ultimately continued bacterial survival. Trimethoprim is often used in combination with  due to their complementary and synergistic mechanisms but may be used as a monotherapy in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of urinary tract infections. Trimethoprim is often given in combination with sulfamethoxazole, which inhibits the preceding step in bacterial protein synthesis - given together, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim inhibit two consecutive steps in the biosynthesis of bacterial nucleic acids and proteins. As a monotherapy trimethoprim is considered bacteriostatic, but in combination with sulfamethoxazole is thought to exert bactericidal activity."
244,"Gemcitabine is indicated for patients previously treated with .Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analog and a chemotherapeutic agent. As a prodrug, gemcitabine is transformed into its active metabolites that work by replacing the building blocks of nucleic acids during DNA elongation, arresting tumour growth and promoting apoptosis of malignant cells. It is also being investigated in other cancer and tumour types.Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analog that mediates its antitumour effects by promoting apoptosis of malignant cells undergoing DNA synthesis. In patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, objective response rates in patients ranged from 5.to 12%, with a median survival duration of 3.9 to 6.3 months. In Phase II trials involving patients with metastatic breast cancer, treatment with gemcitabine alone or with adjuvant chemotherapies resulted in response rate ranging from 13 to 42% and median survival duration ranging from 11.5 to 17.8 months."
245,"As a member of the corticosteroid family, betamethasone is indicated for the treatment of several inflammatory conditions. Betamethasone has potent glucocorticoid activity and negligible mineralocorticoid activity.Corticosteroids bind to the glucocorticoid receptor inhibiting pro-inflammatory signals, while promoting anti-inflammatory signals. Corticosteroids have a wide therapeutic window as patients may require doses that are multiples of what the body naturally produces. In addition, glucocorticoids promote anti-inflammatory genes like interleukin-10. Corticosteroids like betamethasone can act through nongenomic and genomic pathways."
246,"Teniposide is used for the treatment of refractory acute lymphoblastic leukaemiaTeniposide is a semisynthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin that exhibits antitumor activity. Teniposide inhibits DNA synthesis by forming a complex with topoisomerase II and DNA. This complex induces breaks in double stranded DNA and prevents repair by topoisomerase II binding. Accumulated breaks in DNA prevent cells from entering into the mitotic phase of the cell cycle, and lead to cell death. Teniposide acts primarily in the G2 and S phases of the cycle.Teniposide is a phase-specific cytotoxic drug, acting in the late S or early G 2 phase of the cell cycle."
247,"It is effective against tetracycline-resistant vibrios. It is also used in eye drops or ointment to treat bacterial conjunctivitis.An antibiotic first isolated from cultures of _Streptomyces venezuelae_ in 1947 but now produced synthetically. It acts by interfering with bacterial protein synthesis and is mainly bacteriostatic. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 29th ed, p106)    The FDA has withdrawn all oral drug products containing chloramphenicol, due to the high risk of fatal aplastic anemia associated with this specific route of administration.Chloramphenicol is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that was derived from the bacterium Streptomyces venezuelae and is now produced synthetically. Chloramphenicol stops bacterial growth by binding to the bacterial ribosome (blocking peptidyl transferase) and inhibiting protein synthesis.Chloramphenicol is lipid-soluble, allowing it to diffuse through the bacterial cell membrane."
248,"Used to treat upper respiratory tract bacterial infections, chronic bronchitis, pneumonia, sinusitis, pharyntitis and tonsillitis, skin absceses, urinary tract infections and pyelonephritis caused by E. coli, S. pyogenes, S. aureus,S. saprphyticus, S. penumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis.Loracarbef is a carbacephem antibiotic sometimes grouped together with the second-generation cephalosporin antibiotics. It is marketed under the trade name Lorabid.Loracarbef is considered a second generation cephalosporin antibiotic. Loracarbef has a spectrum of activity similar to that of the second generation cephalosporins. It is structurally identical to cefaclor except for a sulfur atom that has been replaced by a methylene group."
249,"Lansoprazole is used to reduce gastric acid secretion and is approved for short term treatment of active gastric ulcers, active duodenal ulcers, erosive reflux oesophagitis, symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) induced gastric and duodenal ulcers. It may be used in the maintenance and healing of several gastric conditions including duodenal ulcers, NSAID related gastric ulcers, and erosive esophagitis. Lansoprazole is effective at eradicating H. pylori when used in conjunction with amoxicillin and clarithromycin (triple therapy) or with amoxicillin alone (dual therapy). Conveniently, lansoprazole administered any time of day is able to inhibit both daytime and nocturnal acid secretion. The result is that lansoprazole is effective at healing duodenal ulcers, reduces ulcer-related pain, and offers relief from symptoms of heartburn   Lansoprazole also reduces pepsin secretion, making it a useful treatment option for hypersecretory conditions such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.As a PPI, lansoprazole is a prodrug and requires protonation via an acidic environment to become activated."
250,"Dipivefrin is a prodrug which is used as initial therapy for the control of intraocular pressure in chronic open-angle glaucoma.Dipivefrin is a prodrug of adrenaline, which is used to treat glaucoma. It is available as ophthalmic solution (eye drops).Dipivefrin is a member of a class of drugs known as prodrugs. Prodrugs are usually not active in themselves and require biotransformation to the parent compound before therapeutic activity is seen. The addition of pivaloyl groups to the epinephrine molecule enhances its lipophilic character and, as a consequence, its penetration into the anterior chamber.Dipivefrin is a prodrug with little or no pharmacologically activity until it is hydrolyzed into epinephrine inside the human eye. The dipivefrin prodrug delivery system is a more efficient way of delivering the therapeutic effects of epinephrine, with fewer side effects than are associated with conventional epinephrine therapy."
251,"Droperidol is used to produce tranquilization and to reduce the incidence of nausea and vomiting in surgical and diagnostic procedures.A butyrophenone with general properties similar to those of haloperidol. It is used in conjunction with an opioid analgesic such as fentanyl to maintain the patient in a calm state of neuroleptanalgesia with indifference to surroundings but still able to cooperate with the surgeon. (From Martindale, The Extra  Pharmacopoeia, 29th ed, p593)Droperidol produces marked tranquilization and sedation. Droperidol potentiates other CNS depressants. It can produce hypotension and decreased peripheral vascular resistance and may decrease pulmonary arterial pressure (particularly if it is abnormally high)."
252,"While T4 is the major product secreted by the thyroid gland,  T3 exerts the majority of the physiological effects of the thyroid hormones; T4and T3 have a relative potency of ~1:4 (T4:T3). TSH levels should be monitored at least yearly to avoid over-treating with levothyroxine which can result in hyperthyroidism (TSH <0.1mIU/L) and symptoms of increased heart rate, diarrhea, tremor, hypercalcemia, and weakness to name a few. As many cardiac functions including heart rate, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance are closely linked to thyroid status, over-treatment with levothyroxine may result in increases in heart rate, cardiac wall thickness, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease and in elderly patients. In populations with any cardiac concerns, levothyroxine should be initiated at lower doses than those recommended in younger individuals or in patients without cardiac disease. Thyroxine is released from its precursor protein thyroglobulin through proteolysis and secreted into the blood where is it then peripherally deiodinated to form triiodothyronine (T3）which exerts a broad spectrum of stimulatory effects on cell metabolism."
253,"For the treatment of bacterial blepharitis, bacterial bonjunctivitis, corneal injuries, corneal ulcers and meibomianitis. For the prophylaxis of ocular infections following foreign body removalA component of neomycin that is produced by Streptomyces fradiae. On hydrolysis it yields neamine and neobiosamine B. Framycetin works by binding to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit, causing misreading of t-RNA, leaving the bacterium unable to synthesize proteins vital to its growth. This interferes with decoding site in the vicinity of nucleotide 1400 in 16S rRNA of 30S subunit."
254,"For the treatment and management of Brucellosis, mycoplasma infection, acne vulgaris, chlamydial infection;Chronic bronchitisClomocycline is a tetracycline used to treat bacterial infections.Clomocycline is a tetracycline antibiotic that is commonly prescribed by medical doctors for infections and to treat acne. It binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit and prevents the amino-acyl tRNA from binding to the A site of the ribosome. In efflux, a resistance gene encodes a membrane protein that actively pumps Clomocycline out of the cell. In ribosomal protection, a resistance gene encodes a protein which binds to the ribosome and prevents Clomocycline from acting on the ribosome.Clomocycline inhibits cell growth by inhibiting translation. It binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit and prevents the amino-acyl tRNA from binding to the A site of the ribosome."
255,"Meperidine is recommended for relief of moderate to severe acute pain and has the unique ability to interrupt postoperative shivering and shaking chills induced by amphotericin B. Meperidine has also been used for intravenous regional anesthesia, peripheral nerve blocks and intraarticular, epidural and spinal analgesia. Meperidine is considered a second-line agent for the treatment of acute pain.Meperidine is primarily a kappa-opiate receptor agonist and also has local anesthetic effects. Meperidine has more affinity for the kappa-receptor than morphine. Opiate receptors are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as both positive and negative regulators of synaptic transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex."
256,"A lack of sedative and CNS adverse effects make loratadine, along with other second generation antihistamines, preferable over their 1st generation counterparts in many clinical situations.Like other 2nd generation antihistamines, loratadine is selective for peripheral H1 receptors. Loratadine does not penetrate effectively into the central nervous system and has poor affinity for CNS H1-receptors. As a result, loratadine exerts it's effect by targeting H1 histamine receptors. Loratadine binds to H1 histamine receptors found on the surface of epithelial cells, endothelial cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, airway cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells among others. Histamine binding to the H1-receptor facilitates cross linking between transmembrane domains III and V, stabilizing the active form of the receptor."
257,"Used to prevent infection during surgery and to treat many kinds of infections of the blood, bone or joints, respiratory tract, skin, and urinary tract.Cefalotin is a cephalosporin antibiotic.Cefalotin (INN) or cephalothin (USAN) is a semisynthetic first generation cephalosporin having a broad spectrum of antibiotic activity that is administered parenterally.The bactericidal activity of cefalotin results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). The PBPs are transpeptidases which are vital in peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Therefore, their inhibition prevents this vital cell wall compenent from being properly synthesized."
258,"**Effects on blood pressure**    The pharmacodynamic and therapeutic effect of this drug includes is a decrease in blood pressure as well as clinically significant decreases in cardiac output, heart rate, blood flow to the kidney, and glomerular filtration rate. Many of the above effects are due to vasodilation of blood vessels caused by prazosin, resulting in decreased peripheral resistance , . As the blood vessels constrict (narrow), the resistance increases and as they dilate (widen), and peripheral resistance decreases, lowering blood pressure . Alpha-1 receptors are postsynaptic (located after the nerve junction, or space between a nerve fiber and target tissue). Through blood vessel constriction by adrenergic receptor activation, epinephrine and norepinephrine normally act to increase blood pressure ."
259,"May also be used off-label to manage panic disorders with or without agoraphobia, as a second line agent for ADHD in children and adolescents, to manage bulimia nervosa, for short-term management of acute depressive episodes in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, for the treatment of acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder, and for symptomatic treatment of postherpetic neuralgia and painful diabetic neuropathy . TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Unlabeled indications include chronic and neuropathic pain (including diabetic neuropathy), panic disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) .Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant with general pharmacological properties similar to those of structurally related tricyclic antidepressant drugs such as amitriptyline and doxepin. Serotonin reuptake targeting agents may also produce a down-regulation in β-adrenergic receptors in the brain .Imipramine works by inhibiting the neuronal reuptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin . Slowing the reuptake of these neurotransmitters increases their concentration in the synaptic cleft, producing knock-on effects in protein kinase signalling which is thought to contribute to changes in neurotransmission and brain physiology which relieves symptoms of depression ."
260,"Verteporfin accumulates in these abnormal blood vessels and, when stimulated by nonthermal red light with a wavelength of 693 nm in the presence of oxygen, produces highly reactive short-lived singlet oxygen and other reactive oxygen radicals, resulting in local damage to the endothelium and blockage of the vessels.Verteporfin, otherwise known as benzoporphyrin derivative, is a medication used in conjunction with laser treatment to eliminate the abnormal blood vessels in the eye associated with conditions such as the wet form of macular degeneration. Verteporfin accumulates in these abnormal blood vessels and, when stimulated by nonthermal red light with a wavelength of 693 nm in the presence of oxygen, produces highly reactive short-lived singlet oxygen and other reactive oxygen radicals, resulting in local damage to the endothelium and blockage of the vessels.Verteporfin is transported in the plasma primarily by lipoproteins. Verteporfin appears to somewhat preferentially accumulate in neovasculature, including choroidal neovasculature. However, animal models indicate that the drug is also present in the retina. As singlet oxygen and reactive oxygen radicals are cytotoxic, Verteporfin can also be used to destroy tumor cells."
261,"This sensitization occurs through reducing the action potential threshold in peripheral neurons, reducing the intensity of painful stimuli needed to produce a painful sensation. PGE<sub>2</sub> activates the G<sub>q</sub>-coupled EP<sub>1</sub> receptor leading to increased activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C pathway. Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EP<sub>2</sub> receptor which couples to G<sub>s</sub>. PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation through IP, EP<sub>2</sub>, and EP<sub>4</sub> receptors which is believed to be an important activity in the pathology of arthritic conditions. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation."
262,"Also used to treat nausea and vomiting due to motion sickness.A muscarinic antagonist used to study binding characteristics of muscarinic cholinergic receptors.Methscopolamine is a muscarinic antagonist structurally similar to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and acts by blocking the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and is thus classified as an anticholinergic. It is not clear how Methscopolamine prevents nausea and vomiting due to motion sickness. When a person becomes disoriented due to motion, the vestibule sends a signal through nerves to the vomiting center in the brain, and vomiting occurs. It is believe that Methscopolamine prevents communication between the nerves of the vestibule and the vomiting center in the brain by blocking the action of acetylcholine. Methscopolamine also may work directly on the vomiting center."
263,"Metharbital is used for the treatment of epilepsy.Metharbital is a barbiturate anticonvulsant, similar to phenobarbital, marketed as Gemonil by Abbott Laboratories. It was patented in 1905 by Emil Fischer of Merck.Metharbital, a barbiturate, is used for the treatment of short term insomnia. It belongs to a group of medicines called central nervous system (CNS) depressants that induce drowsiness and relieve tension or nervousness. Little analgesia is conferred by barbiturates; their use in the presence of pain may result in excitation.Metharbital binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl- ionopore at the GABAA receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl- ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged."
264,"For the treatment of adults (&ge;18 years of age) with the following infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms: (1) uncomplicated urethral or cervical gonorrhea due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae, (2) uncomplicated urinary tract infections (cystitis) due to Escherichia coli,Staphylococcus epidermidis, or Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and (3) complicated urinary tract infections due to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis,Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, or Enterobacter cloacae.A broad-spectrum 6-fluoronaphthyridinone antibacterial agent (fluoroquinolones) structurally related to nalidixic acid.Enoxacin is a quinolone/fluoroquinolone antibiotic. Enoxacin is bactericidal and its mode of action depends on blocking of bacterial DNA replication by binding itself to an enzyme called DNA gyrase, which allows the untwisting required to replicate one DNA double helix into two. Enoxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Enoxacin may be active against pathogens resistant to drugs that act by different mechanisms.Enoxacin exerts its bactericidal action via the inhibition of the essential bacterial enzyme DNA gyrase (DNA Topoisomerase II)."
265,"For the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, backache, and pain.Tenoxicam, an antiinflammatory agent with analgesic and antipyretic properties, is used to treat osteoarthritis and control acute pain.Tenoxicam, an antiinflammatory agent with analgesic and antipyretic properties, is used to treat osteoarthritis and control acute pain.The antiinflammatory effects of tenoxicam may result from the inhibition of the enzyme cycooxygenase and the subsequent peripheral inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. As prostaglandins sensitize pain receptors, their inhibition accounts for the peripheral analgesic effects of tenoxicam. Antipyresis may occur by central action on the hypothalamus, resulting in peripheral dilation, increased cutaneous blood flow, and subsequent heat loss."
266,"Due to its evidence as an appetite stimulant and an anti-nauseant, Dronabinol is approved for use in anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS and for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments . Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are the two most abundant cannabinoids found naturally in the resin of the marijuana plant, both of which are pharmacologically active due to their interaction with cannabinoid receptors that are found throughout the body . CB1 receptors are found in both the central and peripheral nervous system, and are most abundant in the hippocampus and amygdala, which are the areas of the brain responsible for short-term memory storage and emotional regulation. A decrease in supine blood pressure, made worse by standing, was also observed initially. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance do not appear to develop to the appetite stimulant effect of dronabinol."
267,"Montelukast is indicated for:    (a) the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma in adults and pediatric patients who are 12 months of age and older, although other regional health authorities specifically note this indication for adults and adolescents who are 15 years and older and also include indications for preventing day and night-time symptoms, and the treatment of acetylsalicylic acid-sensitive asthma;    (b) the prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) in patients who are 6 years of age and older, although other regional health authorities specifically note this indication for adults and adolescents who are 15 years and older; and    (c) the relief of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis in patients 2 years of age and older and perennial allergic rhinitis in patients 6 months of age and older, although other regional health authorities specifically note the relief of seasonal allergic rhinitis symptoms for adults and adolescents who are 15 years and older. For instance, montelukast and inhaled corticosteroids can be used concomitantly to demonstrate additive effects to control asthma or to decrease the necessary inhaled corticosteroid dose while still maintaining clinical stability. As a consequence, the agent can elicit substantial blockage of LTD4 leukotriene-mediated bronchoconstriction with doses as low as 5 mg. At the same time, in patients aged 15 years and older who were experiencing seasonal allergic rhinitis, the use of montelukast caused a median reduction of 13% in peripheral blood eosinophil counts when compared to placebo as well.Cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLT) like LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4, among others, are eicosanoids released by a variety of cells like mast cells and eosinophils. Alternatively, in allergic rhinitis, CysLTs are released by the nasal mucosa when exposed to allergens during both early and late phase reactions and participate in eliciting symptoms of allergic rhinitis like a congested nose and airway."
268,"Fluoxetine is additionally indicated for the treatment of female patients with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).Fluoxetine is a 2nd generation antidepressant categorized as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). It gained FDA approval in 1987 and although it was initially intended for the treatment of depression, today it is commonly prescribed to manage depression in addition to various other pathologies.Fluoxetine blocks the serotonin reuptake transporter in the presynaptic terminal, which ultimately results in sustained levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in certain brain areas. The monoaminergic hypothesis of depression emerged in 1965 and linked depression with dysfunction of neurotransmitters such as noradrenaline and serotonin. As a result of this hypothesis, drugs that modulate levels of serotonin such as fluoxetine were developed. Fluoxetine interacts to a degree with the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor and it has been suggested that through this mechanism, it is able to increase noradrenaline and dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex."
269,"Methohexital is indicated for use as an intravenous anaesthetic. It has also been commonly used to induce deep sedation.An intravenous anesthetic with a short duration of action that may be used for induction of anesthesia.Methohexital, a barbiturate, is used for the induction of anesthesia prior to the use of other general anesthetic agents and for induction of anesthesia for short surgical, diagnostic, or therapeutic procedures associated with minimal painful stimuli. Little analgesia is conferred by barbiturates; their use in the presence of pain may result in excitation.Methohexital binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl- ionopore at the GABAA receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl- ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged."
270,"Chlordiazepoxide is indicated for the management of anxiety disorders or for the short-term relief of symptoms of anxiety, withdrawal symptoms of acute alcoholism, and preoperative apprehension and anxiety.An anxiolytic benzodiazepine derivative with anticonvulsant, sedative, and amnesic properties. The drug has been studied extensively in many species of animals and these studies are suggestive of action on the limbic system of the brain, which recent evidence indicates is involved in emotional responses. The taming effect of chlordiazepoxide was further demonstrated in rats made vicious by lesions in the septal area of the brain. The drug dosage which effectively blocked the vicious reaction was well below the dose which caused sedation in these animals.Chlordiazepoxide binds to stereospecific benzodiazepine (BZD) binding sites on GABA (A) receptor complexes at several sites within the central nervous system, including the limbic system and reticular formation. This results in an increased binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA to the GABA(A) receptor."
271,"For the treatment of schizophrenia; to control nausea and vomiting; for relief of restlessness and apprehension before surgery; for acute intermittent porphyria; as an adjunct in the treatment of tetanus; to control the manifestations of the manic type of manic-depressive illness; for relief of intractable hiccups; for the treatment of severe behavioral problems in children (1 to 12 years of age) marked by combativeness and/or explosive hyperexcitable behavior (out of proportion to immediate provocations), and in the short-term treatment of hyperactive children who show excessive motor activity with accompanying conduct disorders consisting of some or all of the following symptoms: impulsivity, difficulty sustaining attention, aggressivity, mood lability, and poor frustration tolerance.The prototypical phenothiazine antipsychotic drug. It also exerts sedative and antiemetic activity. Chlorpromazine has actions at all levels of the central nervous system-primarily at subcortical levels-as well as on multiple organ systems. Chlorpromazine has strong antiadrenergic and weaker peripheral anticholinergic activity; ganglionic blocking action is relatively slight. It also possesses slight antihistaminic and antiserotonin activity.Chlorpromazine acts as an antagonist (blocking agent) on different postsysnaptic receptors -on dopaminergic-receptors (subtypes D1, D2, D3 and D4 - different antipsychotic properties on productive and unproductive symptoms), on serotonergic-receptors (5-HT1 and 5-HT2, with anxiolytic, antidepressive and antiaggressive properties as well as an attenuation of extrapypramidal side-effects, but also leading to weight gain, fall in blood pressure, sedation and ejaculation difficulties), on histaminergic-receptors (H1-receptors, sedation, antiemesis, vertigo, fall in blood pressure and weight gain), alpha1/alpha2-receptors (antisympathomimetic properties, lowering of blood pressure, reflex tachycardia, vertigo, sedation, hypersalivation and incontinence as well as sexual dysfunction, but may also attenuate pseudoparkinsonism - controversial) and finally on muscarinic (cholinergic) M1/M2-receptors (causing anticholinergic symptoms like dry mouth, blurred vision, obstipation, difficulty/inability to urinate, sinus tachycardia, ECG-changes and loss of memory, but the anticholinergic action may attenuate extrapyramidal side-effects)."
272,"For the prophylaxis and treatment of illness caused by various strains of influenza A virus in adults.An RNA synthesis inhibitor that is used as an antiviral agent in the prophylaxis and treatment of influenza.Rimantadine, a cyclic amine, is a synthetic antiviral drug and a derivate of adamantane, like a similar drug amantadine. Rimantadine is inhibitory to the in vitro replication of influenza A virus isolates from each of the three antigenic subtypes (H1N1, H2H2 and H3N2) that have been isolated from man. Rimantadine has little or no activity against influenza B virus. Rimantadine does not appear to interfere with the immunogenicity of inactivated influenza A vaccine.The mechanism of action of rimantadine is not fully understood. Rimantadine appears to exert its inhibitory effect early in the viral replicative cycle, possibly inhibiting the uncoating of the virus."
273,"The use of amikacin in the treatment of staphylococcal infections should be restricted only to second-line therapy, and should be limited to only those patients suffering from severe infections caused by susceptible strains of staphylococcus species who have failed to show sensitivity to other available antibiotics. Bacteriologic studies should be performed to identify causative organisms and their susceptibilities to amikacin. Amikacin may be used as initial therapy in suspected gram-negative infections and therapy may be initiated before obtaining the results of susceptibility testing.Amikacin is a semi-synthetic aminoglycoside antibiotic that is derived from kanamycin A. Amikacin is synthesized by acylation with the l-(-)-γ-amino-α-hydroxybutyryl side chain at the C-1 amino group of the deoxystreptamine moiety of kanamycin A.    Amikacin's unique property is that it exerts activity against more resistant gram-negative bacilli such as Acinetobacter baumanii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In September 2018, a liposomal inhalation suspension of this drug was approved by the FDA for the treatment of lung disease caused by Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) bacteria in a small population of patients with the disease who do not respond to traditional treatment.Amikacin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic. Amikacin, as well as the rest of the aminoglycosides, are generally bacteriocidal against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria."
274,"Lenalidomide is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma (MM) in combination with dexamethasone. In combination with a rituximab product, lenalidomide is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously treated follicular lymphoma (FL) or previously treated marginal zone lymphoma (MZL).Lenalidomide (previously referred to as CC-5013) is an immunomodulatory drug with potent antineoplastic, anti-angiogenic, and anti-inflammatory properties. Lenalidomide also mediates indirect antitumour effects via its immunomodulatory actions: it inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are implicated in various hematologic malignancies. Lenalidomide enhances the host immunity by stimulating T cell proliferation and enhancing the activity of natural killer (NK) cells. Lenalidomide directly exerts antitumour effects by inhibiting the proliferation and inducing apoptosis of tumour cells."
275,"It may be also be used to treat acute pain from various sources, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in children over 2, ankylosing spondylitis, and primary dysmenorrhea.Celecoxib, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) which is known for its decreased risk of causing gastrointestinal bleeding compared to other NSAIDS. , another member of the COX-2 inhibitor drug class, also known as Vioxx, was withdrawn from the market due to prothrombotic cardiovascular risks. Following an FDA Advisory Committee meeting in 2005, in which data from large clinical outcome trials were evaluated, the FDA concluded that the risk for cardiovascular thrombotic events for both COX-2 selective NSAIDs and nonselective NSAIDs was evident. It is not advisable to administer NSAIDS to these groups of patients. Celecoxib poses less of an ulceration risk than other NSAIDS, owing to its decreased effect on gastric mucosal prostaglandin synthesis when compared to placebo."
276,"Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists are members of the ocular hypotensive agent drug class that are used in the chronic treatment of glaucoma. Brimonidine is the first topical treatment approved for facial erythema of rosacea.Brimonidine is a highly selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist that is 1000-fold more selective for the alpha2-adrenergic receptor than the alpha1-adrenergic receptor. In comparative studies consisting of patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, the ocular hypotensive effect of brimonidine was maintained during treatment periods of up to 1 year. It is proposed that initial dosing of the drug causes a reduction in aqueous humour production and chronic dosing leads to an increase in uveoscleral outflow. As brimonidine mediates a potent peripheral vasoconstrictive activity by selectively working on the alpha-2 adrenoceptors, the use of brimonidine is thought to be efficacious for the treatment of facial erythema of rosacea, which is thought to arise from vasomotor instability and abnormal vasodilation of the superficial cutaneous vasculature of the face."
277,"Used to treat infections caused by penicillinase-producing staphylococci which have demonstrated susceptibility to the drug.One of the penicillins which is resistant to penicillinase.Dicloxacillin is a beta-lactamase resistant penicillin similar to oxacillin. Dicloxacillin has <i>in vitro</i> activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Dicloxacillin is stable against hydrolysis by a variety of beta-lactamases, including penicillinases, and cephalosporinases and extended spectrum beta-lactamases.Dicloxacillin exerts a bactericidal action against penicillin-susceptible microorganisms during the state of active multiplication. By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, dicloxacillin inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that dicloxacillin interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."
278,"This restriction is required because a substantial proportion of any group of patients treated with Nabilone can be expected to experience disturbing psychotomimetic reactions not observed with other antiemetic agents.Nabilone (marketed as Cesamet) is a synthetic form of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ�?THC), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis (marijuana). Nabilone is approved by the FDA for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments . Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are the two most abundant cannabinoids found naturally in the resin of the marijuana plant, both of which are pharmacologically active due to their interaction with cannabinoid receptors that are found throughout the body . It was approved in 1985 by the United States FDA for treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting that has not responded to conventional antiemetics. It has been suggested that the antiemetic effect of nabilone is caused by interaction with the cannabinoid receptor system, i.e., the CB (1) receptor, which is a component of the endocannabinoid system of the body."
279,"For the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in males and for gram-negative-bacterial infections in the gastrointestinal system and the genitourinary tract.A synthetic broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent active against most gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.Pefloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic. Flouroquinolones such as pefloxacin possess excellent activity against gram-negative aerobic bacteria such as E.coli and Neisseria gonorrhoea as well as gram-positive bacteria including S. pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. They also posses effective activity against shigella, salmonella, campylobacter, gonococcal organisms, and multi drug resistant pseudomonas and enterobacter.The bactericidal action of pefloxacin results from interference with the activity of the bacterial enzymes DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, which are needed for the transcription and replication of bacterial DNA. Topoisomerase IV appears to be the preferential target in gram-positive organisms. As a result DNA replication and transcription is inhibited."
280,"Buspirone was first approved in 1986 by the FDA  and has been used to treat anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and relieve symptoms of anxiety. The delayed onset of action of buspirone suggests that the therapeutic effectiveness in generalized anxiety may involved more than its molecular mechanism of action at the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors, or buspirone may induce adaptations of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors. Unlike benzodiazepines and barbiturates used in anxiety disorders, buspirone is not associated with a risk for developing physical dependence or withdrawal, or any significant interaction with central nervous system depressants such as ethanol. Buspirone acts as a full agonist at presynaptic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors, or 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> autoreceptors, expressed at dorsal raphe while acting as a partial agonist at the postsynaptic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors expressed on hippocampus and cortex. Buspirone also displays a weak affinity for serotonin 5HT2 receptors and acts as a weak antagonist on dopamine D2 autoreceptors, although there is not much evidence that the action at these receptors contribute to the anxiolytic effect of buspirone."
281,"For use as an adjunct to diet to improve glycemic control in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) whose hyperglycemia cannot be managed with diet alone.Miglitol inhibits the breakdown complex carbohydrates into glucose. It is primarily used in diabetes mellitus type 2 for establishing greater glycemic control by preventing the digestion of carbohydrates (such as disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides) into monosaccharides which can be absorbed by the body. Because its mechanism of action is different, the effect of miglitol to enhance glycemic control is additive to that of sulfonylureas when used in combination. In addition, miglitol diminishes the insulinotropic and weight-increasing effects of sulfonylureas. In diabetic patients, this enzyme inhibition results in delayed glucose absorption and lowering of postprandial hyperglycemia."
282,"Fosinoprilat is a competitive inhibitor of ACE, a peptidyl dipeptidase that is part of the RAAS. ATII increases blood pressure using a number of mechanisms. ACE inhibitors inhibit the rapid conversion of ATI to ATII and antagonize RAAS-induced increases in blood pressure. ACE (also known as kininase II) is also involved in the enzymatic deactivation of bradykinin, a vasodilator. Fosinoprilat, the active metabolite of fosinopril, competes with ATI for binding to ACE and inhibits and enzymatic proteolysis of ATI to ATII."
283,"Also used before an operation to prevent infection after surgery.Cefotaxime is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic. Like other third-generation cephalosporins, it has broad spectrum activity against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. Cefotaxime sodium is marketed under various trade names including Claforan (Sanofi-Aventis).Cefotaxime is a third generation intravenous cephalosporin antibiotic. It has broad spectrum activity against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. A positive feature of cefotaxime is that it display a resistance to penicillinases and is useful to treat infections that are resistant to penicillin derivatives.The bactericidal activity of cefotaxime results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs)."
284,"It is a member of the class of nitrocatechols. When administered concomittantly with levodopa and a decarboxylase inhibitor (e.g., carbidopa), increased and more sustained plasma levodopa concentrations are reached as compared to the administration of levodopa and a decarboxylase inhibitor.Entacapone is structurally and pharmacologically related to tolcapone, but unlike tolcapone, is not associated with hepatotoxicity. Entacapone selectively and reversiblly inhibits catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). In mammals, COMT is distributed throughout various organs with the highest activities in the liver and kidney. When entacapone is given in conjunction with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbidopa, plasma levels of levodopa are greater and more sustained than after administration of levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor alone."
285,"Used in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of human immunovirus (HIV) infections.A dideoxynucleoside compound in which the 3&#39;-hydroxy group on the sugar moiety has been replaced by an azido group. The compound is a potent inhibitor of HIV replication, acting as a chain-terminator of viral DNA during reverse transcription. It improves immunologic function, partially reverses the HIV-induced neurological dysfunction, and improves certain other clinical abnormalities associated with AIDS. Zidovudine is phosphorylated to active metabolites that compete for incorporation into viral DNA. The lack of a 3'-OH group in the incorporated nucleoside analogue prevents the formation of the 5' to 3' phosphodiester linkage essential for DNA chain elongation, and therefore, the viral DNA growth is terminated.Zidovudine, a structural analog of thymidine, is a prodrug that must be phosphorylated to its active 5�?triphosphate metabolite, zidovudine triphosphate (ZDV-TP)."
286,"For the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency and frequency.Darifenacin (Enablex®, Novartis) is a medication used to treat urinary incontinence. Darifenacin blocks M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, which mediate bladder muscle contractions. <i>In vitro</i> studies using human recombinant muscarinic receptor subtypes show that darifenacin has greater affinity for the M3 receptor than for the other known muscarinic receptors (9 and 12-fold greater affinity for M3 compared to M1 and M5, respectively, and 59-fold greater affinity for M3 compared to both M2 and M4). Muscarinic receptors play an important role in several major cholinergically mediated functions, including contractions of the urinary bladder smooth muscle and stimulation of salivary secretion. Adverse drug effects such as dry mouth, constipation and abnormal vision may be mediated through effects on M3 receptors in these organs.Darifenacin selectively antagonizes the muscarinic M3 receptor."
287,"Oxycodone is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. There is also an extended release formulation indicated for chronic moderate to severe pain requiring continuous opioid analgesics for an extended period.Oxycodone is a semisynthetic opioid analgesic derived from thebaine in Germany in 1917. These tissues include the respiratory centre in the brain stem, the cough centre in the medulla, muscles of the pupils, gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular system, endocrine system, and immune system. Oxycodone's effect on the respiratory centre is dose dependant respiratory depression. In the cardiovascular system histamine may be released leading to pruritis, red eyes, flushing, sweating, and decreased blood pressure."
288,"For the treatment of pulmonary embolism, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation and flutter, cerebral embolism, mural thrombosis, and thrombophili. Also used for anticoagulant prophylaxis.An indandione that has been used as an anticoagulant. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p234)Phenindione thins the blood by antagonizing vitamin K which is required for the production of clotting factors in the liver. Phenindione has actions similar to warfarin, but it is now rarely employed because of its higer incidence of severe adverse effects.Phenindione inhibits vitamin K reductase, resulting in depletion of the reduced form of vitamin K (vitamin KH2). The synthesis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X and anticoagulant proteins C and S is inhibited."
289,"For the management of locally confined Stage B2-C and Stage D2 metastatic carcinoma of the prostateAn antiandrogen with about the same potency as cyproterone in rodent and canine species.Flutamide is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen. In animal studies, flutamide demonstrates potent antiandrogenic effects. It exerts its antiandrogenic action by inhibiting androgen uptake and/or by inhibiting nuclear binding of androgen in target tissues or both. Elevations of plasma testosterone and estradiol levels have been noted following flutamide administration.Flutamide is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen that blocks the action of both endogenous and exogenous testosterone by binding to the androgen receptor. In addition Flutamide is a potent inhibitor of testosterone-stimulated prostatic DNA synthesis."
290,"It is indicated for prophylaxis of recurrent gastric or duodenal ulcers, as adjunctive therapy in the management of cystic fibrosis in children, and to treat NSAID induced lesions and gastrointestinal symptoms.A histamine congener, it competitively inhibits histamine binding to histamine H2 receptors. Cimetidine has a range of pharmacological actions. It inhibits gastric acid secretion, as well as pepsin and gastrins output. It also blocks the activity of cytochrome P-450 which might explain proposals for use in neoadjuvant therapy.Cimetidine is a histamine H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonist. It reduces basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion and a reduction in gastric volume, acidity, and amount of gastric acid released in response to stimuli including food, caffeine, insulin, betazole, or pentagastrin."
291,"While haloperidol has demonstrated pharmacologic activity at a number of receptors in the brain, it exerts its antipsychotic effect through its strong antagonism of the dopamine receptor (mainly D2), particularly within the mesolimbic and mesocortical systems of the brain. Dopamine-antagonizing medications such as haloperidol are though to improve psychotic symptoms and states that are caused by an over-production of dopamine, such as schizophrenia, which is theorized to be caused by a hyperdopaminergic state within the limbic system of the brain. Traditional antipsychotics, such as haloperidol, bind more tightly than dopamine itself to the dopamine D2 receptor, with dissociation constants that are lower than that for dopamine. Due to the risk of unpleasant and sometimes lifelong extrapyramidal symptoms, newer antipsychotic medications than haloperidol have been discovered and formulated. This is also consistent with the theory of a lower affinity for D2 receptors for these drugs."
292,"It is now more commonly used as a booster of other protease inhibitors and is available in both liquid formulations and as capsules. Ritonavir is a potent CYP3A inhibitor that increases peak and trough plasma drug concentrations of other protease inhibitors such as  and overall drug exposure. Ritonavir is combined with other drugs to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients at risk for progressing into a severe form of the disease, such as .Ritonavir is a protease inhibitor with activity against Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1). Ritonavir binds to the protease active site and inhibits the activity of the enzyme. Ritonavic inhibits the HIV viral proteinase enzyme that normally cleaves the structural and replicative proteins that arise from major HIV genes, such as *gag* and *pol*."
293,"Also used to control nausea and vomiting.A phenothiazine used as an antipsychotic agent and as an antiemetic.Triflupromazine is a member of a class of drugs called phenthiazines, which are dopamine D1/D2 receptor antagonists. Phenothiazines are used to treat serious mental and emotional disorders, including schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. It reduces anxiety, emotional withdrawal, hallucinations, disorganized thoughts, blunted mood, and suspiciousness. Triflupromazine is used particularly to control violent behavior during acute episodes of psychotic disorders. The mechanism of the anti-emetic effect is due predominantly to blockage of the dopamine D2 neurotransmitter receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) and vomiting centre."
294,"Used for fast digitalization in congestive heart failure.Cardioactive derivative of lanatoside A or of digitoxin used for fast digitalization in congestive heart failure.The main pharmacological effects of acetyldigitoxin are on the heart. Its main cardiac effects are 1) a decrease of conduction of electrical impulses through the AV node, making it a commonly used drug in controlling the heart rate during atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, and 2) an increase of force of contraction via inhibition of the Na+/K+ ATPase pump.Acetyldigitoxin binds to a site on the extracellular aspect of the &alpha;-subunit of the Na+/K+ATPase pump in the membranes of heart cells (myocytes). Increased amounts of Ca2+ are then stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and released by each action potential, which is unchanged by acetyldigitoxin. This is a different mechanism from that of catecholamines. This is important for its clinical use in different arrhythmias."
295,"Administered orally, vancomycin is indicated in adult and pediatric patients for the treatment of _Clostridium difficile_-associated diarrhea and for enterocolitis caused by _Staphylococcus aureus_ (including methicillin-resistant strains).Antibacterial obtained from Streptomyces orientalis. It is a glycopeptide related to ristocetin that inhibits bacterial cell wall assembly and is toxic to kidneys and the inner ear. As of January 29 2018, CutisPharma's Firvanq is the only FDA approved vancomycin oral liquid treatment option available for the the treatment of _Clostridium difficile_ associated diarrhea and enterocolitis caused by _Staphylococcus aureus_, including methicillin-resistant strains . Vancomycin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections: <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>, <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i>, <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> (including penicillin-resistant strains), <i>Streptococcus agalactiae</i>, <i>Actinomyces</i> species, and <i>Lactobacillus</i> species. The combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside acts synergistically in vitro against many strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus bovis, enterococci, and the viridans group streptococci .The bactericidal action of vancomycin results primarily from inhibition of cell-wall biosynthesis."
296,"For use in the treatment of excessive postoperative bleeding.An antifibrinolytic agent that acts by inhibiting plasminogen activators which have fibrinolytic properties.Aminocaproic acid works as an antifibrinolytic. Aminocaproic acid may be a possible prophylactic for vascular disease, as it may prevent formation of lipoprotein (a), a risk factor for vascular disease. Aminocaproic acid binds reversibly to the kringle domain of plasminogen and blocks the binding of plasminogen to fibrin and its activation to plasmin. With NO activation of plasmin, there is a reduction in fibrinolysis. This consequently will reduce the amount of bleeding post surgery."
297,"Dextromethorphan in combination with  is indicated in the treatment of pseudobulbar affect.Dextromethorphan is a levorphanol derivative and codeine analog commonly used as a cough suppressant and also a drug of abuse. It has a moderate therapeutic window, as intoxication can occur at higher doses. Dextromethorphan has a moderate duration of action. It is also an antagonist of α3/β4 nicotinic receptors. However, the mechanism by which dextromethorphan's receptor agonism and antagonism translates to a clinical effect is not well understood."
298,"For the treatment of metastatic testicular tumors, metastatic ovarian tumors and advanced bladder cancer.Cisplatin, cisplatinum or cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (CDDP) is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug used to treat various types of cancers, including sarcomas, some carcinomas (e.g. small cell lung cancer, and ovarian cancer), lymphomas and germ cell tumors. It was the first member of its class, which now also includes carboplatin and oxaliplatin.Cisplatin is an antineoplastic in the class of alkylating agents and is used to treat various forms of cancer. Alkylating agents are so named because of their ability to add alkyl groups to many electronegative groups under conditions present in cells. This makes the strands unable to uncoil and separate. Alkylating agents work by three different mechanisms all of which achieve the same end result - disruption of DNA function and cell death.Alkylating agents work by three different mechanisms: 1) attachment of alkyl groups to DNA bases, resulting in the DNA being fragmented by repair enzymes in their attempts to replace the alkylated bases, preventing DNA synthesis and RNA transcription from the affected DNA, 2) DNA damage via the formation of cross-links (bonds between atoms in the DNA) which prevents DNA from being separated for synthesis or transcription, and 3) the induction of mispairing of the nucleotides leading to mutations."
299,"For use in conjunction with antacids or histamine H2-receptor antagonists in the treatment of peptic ulcer, to reduce further gastric acid secretion and delay gastric emptying.Anisotropine methylbromide is a quaternary ammonium compound. Depending on the dose, anisotropine methylbromide may reduce the motility and secretory activity of the gastrointestinal system, and the tone of the ureter and urinary bladder and may have a slight relaxant action on the bile ducts and gallbladder. In general, smaller doses of anisotropine methylbromide inhibit salivary and bronchial secretions, sweating, and accommodation; cause dilatation of the pupil; and increase the heart rate. Larger doses are required to decrease motility of the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts and to inhibit gastric acid secretion.Anisotropine methylbromide is a quaternary ammonium compound. Depending on the dose, anisotropine methylbromide may reduce the motility and secretory activity of the gastrointestinal system, and the tone of the ureter and urinary bladder and may have a slight relaxant action on the bile ducts and gallbladder."
300,"For the treatment of parenchymal neurocysticercosis due to active lesions caused by larval forms of the pork tapeworm, <i>Taenia solium</i> and for the treatment of cystic hydatid disease of the liver, lung, and peritoneum, caused by the larval form of the dog tapeworm, <i>Echinococcus granulosus</i>.A benzimidazole broad-spectrum anthelmintic structurally related to mebendazole that is effective against many diseases. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p38)Albendazole is a broad-spectrum anthelmintic. The principal mode of action for albendazole is by its inhibitory effect on tubulin polymerization which results in the loss of cytoplasmic microtubules.Albendazole causes degenerative alterations in the tegument and intestinal cells of the worm by diminishing its energy production, ultimately leading to immobilization and death of the parasite. It works by binding to the colchicine-sensitive site of tubulin, thus inhibiting its polymerization or assembly into microtubules. As cytoplasmic microtubules are critical in promoting glucose uptake in larval and adult stages of the susceptible parasites, the glycogen stores of the parasites are depleted."
301,"Trandolapril may be used to treat mild to moderate hypertension, to improve survival following myocardial infarction in clinically stable patients with left ventricular dysfunction, as an adjunct treatment for congestive heart failure, and to slow the rate of progression of renal disease in hypertensive individuals with diabetes mellitus and microalbuminuria or overt nephropathy.Trandolapril is the ethyl ester prodrug of a nonsulfhydryl ACE inhibitor, trandolaprilat. Trandolapril is deesterified in the liver to the diacid metabolite, trandolaprilat, which is approximately eight times more active as an inhibitor of ACE than its parent compound. ATII increases blood pressure via a number of mechanisms. ACE inhibitors inhibit the rapid conversion of ATI to ATII and antagonize RAAS-induced increases in blood pressure. Trandolaprilat, the active metabolite of trandolapril, competes with ATI for binding to ACE and inhibits and enzymatic proteolysis of ATI to ATII."
302,"It is typically administered intravenously. It shows activity against infections with Aspergillus and Candida, and works by inhibiting β(1,3)-D-Glucan of the fungal cell wall.Caspofungin is an antifungal drug, and belongs to a new class termed the echinocandins. Antifungals in the echinocandin class inhibit the synthesis of glucan in the cell wall, probably via the enzyme 1,3-beta glucan synthase. beta-(1,3)-D-glucan is not present in mammalian cells. The primary target is beta-(1,3)-glucan synthase."
303,"For the treatment of intraocular hypertension and chronic open-angle glaucomaA beta-adrenergic antagonist used as an anti-arrhythmia agent, an anti-angina agent, an antihypertensive agent, and an antiglaucoma agent.Carteolol is a beta1 and beta2 (non-selective) adrenergic receptor-blocking agent that does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct myocardial depressant, or local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) activity. Carteolol, when applied topically to the eye, has the action of reducing elevated, as well as normal, intraocular pressure, whether or not accompanied by glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of glaucomatous visual field loss and optic nerve damage. Carteolol reduces intraocular pressure with little or no effect on pupil size or accommodation in contrast to the miosis which cholinergic agents are known to produce.The primary mechanism of the ocular hypotensive action of carteolol in reducing intraocular pressure is most likely a decrease in aqueous humor production. This process is initiated by the non-selective beta1 and beta2 adrenergic receptor blockade."
304,"An excess of tretinoin can be teratogenic. It is used in the treatment of psoriasis; acne vulgaris; and several other skin diseases. It has also been approved for use in promyelocytic leukemia (leukemia, promyelocytic, acute).Alitretinoin (9-<i>cis</i>-retinoic acid) is a naturally-occurring endogenous retinoid indicated for topical treatment of cutaneous lesions in patients with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. Alitretinoin inhibits the growth of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) cells <i>in vitro</i>.Alitretinoin binds to and activates all known intracellular retinoid receptor subtypes (RARa, RARb, RARg, RXRa, RXRb and RXRg). Once activated these receptors function as transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes that control the process of cellular differentiation and proliferation in both normal and neoplastic cells."
305,A proximal action of metolazone has been shown in humans by increased excretion of phosphate and magnesium ions and by a markedly increased fractional excretion of sodium in patients with severely compromised glomerular filtration. Sodium and chloride ions are excreted in approximately equivalent amounts. The increased delivery of sodium to the distal tubular exchange site results in increased potassium excretion. Metolazone does not inhibit carbonic anhydrase. The antihypertensive mechanism of action of metolazone is not fully understood but is presumed to be related to its saluretic and diuretic properties.
306,"However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties. Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics. Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking. However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects. The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkin’s lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer."
307,"For production of local or regional anesthesia by infiltration techniques such as percutaneous injection and intravenous regional anesthesia by peripheral nerve block techniques such as brachial plexus and intercostal and by central neural techniques such as lumbar and caudal epidural blocks.A local anesthetic of the amide type now generally used for surface anesthesia. It is one of the most potent and toxic of the long-acting local anesthetics and its parenteral use is restricted to spinal anesthesia. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p1006)Dibucaine is an amide-type local anesthetic, similar to lidocaine.Local anesthetics block both the initiation and conduction of nerve impulses by decreasing the neuronal membrane's permeability to sodium ions through sodium channel inhibition. This reversibly stabilizes the membrane and inhibits depolarization, resulting in the failure of a propagated action potential and subsequent conduction blockade."
308,"For the treatment of CMV retinitis in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and for treatment of acyclovir-resistant mucocutaneous HSV infections in immunocompromised patients.An antiviral agent used in the treatment of cytomegalovirus retinitis. Foscarnet also shows activity against human herpes viruses and HIV.Foscarnet is an organic analogue of inorganic pyrophosphate that inhibits replication of herpes viruses <i>in vitro</i> including cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2). Foscarnet does not require activation (phosphorylation) by thymidine kinase or other kinases and therefore is active in vitro against HSV TK deficient mutants and CMV UL97 mutants. Thus, HSV strains resistant to acyclovir or CMV strains resistant to ganciclovir may be sensitive to foscarnet. However, acyclovir or ganciclovir resistant mutants with alterations in the viral DNA polymerase may be resistant to foscarnet and may not respond to therapy with foscarnet."
309,"Erlotinib is indicated for:    - The treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with tumors showing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations . Erlotinib is an inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase that is used in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer and several other types of cancer. It is typically marketed under the trade name Tarceva. Erlotinib binds to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase in a reversible fashion at the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site of the receptor. This finding introduces the potential use of erlotinib in the treatment of JAK2V617F-positive PV and other myeloproliferative disorders.The mechanism of clinical antitumor action of erlotinib is not fully characterized."
310,"It is also indicated for the treatment of biopsy-proven minimal change nephrotic syndrome in pediatric patients. It has been used in the treatment of lymphoma and leukemia. Cyclophosphamide may also cause sterility, birth defects, mutations, and cancer.Cyclophosphamide is an antineoplastic in the class of alkylating agents and is used to treat various forms of cancer. Alkylating agents are so named because of their ability to add alkyl groups to many electronegative groups under conditions present in cells. Alkylating agents work by three different mechanisms all of which achieve the same end result - disruption of DNA function and cell death.Alkylating agents work by three different mechanisms: 1) attachment of alkyl groups to DNA bases, resulting in the DNA being fragmented by repair enzymes in their attempts to replace the alkylated bases, preventing DNA synthesis and RNA transcription from the affected DNA, 2) DNA damage via the formation of cross-links (bonds between atoms in the DNA) which prevents DNA from being separated for synthesis or transcription, and 3) the induction of mispairing of the nucleotides leading to mutations."
311,For the treatment of refractory partial epilepsy.Mephenytoin is used for the treatment of refractory partial epilepsy. These are heterocyclic aromatic compounds containing an imiazolidinedione moiety substituted by a phenyl group. Mephenytoin is known to target sodium channel protein type 5 subunit alpha. Mephenytoin is a hydantoin-derivative anticonvulsant used to control various partial seizures. This includes the reduction of posttetanic potentiation at synapses.
312,"The proteins that rofecoxib target include elastin and prostaglandin G/H synthase 2. NSAIDs appear to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis via the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX), which are responsible for catalyzing the formation of prostaglandins in the arachidonic acid pathyway. Although the exact mechanisms have not been clearly established, NSAIDs exert their anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic primarily through the inhibition of COX-2. As rofecoxib is selective for COX-2, it may be potentially associated with a decreased risk of certain adverse events, but more data is needed to fully evaulate the drug.The anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic effects of NSAIDs appear to result from the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. Although the exact mechanism of action has not been determined, these effects appear to be mediated through the inhibition of the COX-2 isoenzyme at the sites of inflammation with subsequent reduction in the synthesis of certain prostaglandins from their arachidonic acid precursors."
313,"Various beta-lactamase producing organisms may be treated, as indicated in certain sections below. Because of its chemical structure, it is effective against organisms that are resistant to first-line cephalosporin therapy due to the production of beta-lactamase enzymes.Cefdinir is a bactericidal agent that treats bacterial infections by interfering with cell wall synthesis. As a result, many organisms that are resistant to other cephalosporins may be susceptible to cefdinir.Five-member thiazolidine rings that make up penicillins are replaced in cephalosporins by a six-member dihydrothiazine ring, conferring greater bactericidal activity. With a mechanism similar to other beta-lactam antibiotics, the bactericidal activity of cefdinir is caused by the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). It has also been shown to inhibit transpeptidase enzymes of various bacteria, which may play a role in its bactericidal action."
314,"Ciprofloxacin immediate release tablets, oral suspensions, and intravenous injections are indicated for the treatment of skin and skin structure infections, bone and joint infections, complicated intra-abdominal infections, nosocomial pneumonia, febrile neutropenia, adults who have inhaled anthrax, plague, chronic bacterial prostatitis, lower respiratory tract infections including acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, urinary tract infections, complicated urinary tract infections in pediatrics, complicated pyelonephritis in pediatrics, and acute sinusitis. A ciprofloxacin otic solution and otic suspension with hydrocortisone are indicated for acute otitis externa. A ciprofloxacin extended release tablet is indicated for uncomplicated urinary tract infections, complicated urinary tract infections, and acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis.Ciprofloxacin is a second generation fluoroquinolone that has spawned many derivative antibiotics. It produces its action through inhibition of bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Ciprofloxacin binds to bacterial DNA gyrase with 100 times the affinity of mammalian DNA gyrase."
315,"Nortriptyline is indicated for the relief of the symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD). It is used in the treatment of major depression and is also used off-label for chronic pain and other conditions.Nortriptyline exerts antidepressant effects likely by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine at neuronal cell membranes. It displays a more selective reuptake inhibition for noradrenaline, which may explain increased symptom improvement after nortriptyline therapy. Tricyclic antidepressants do not inhibit monoamine oxidase nor do they affect dopamine reuptake. As with other tricyclics, nortriptyline displays affinity for other receptors including mACh receptors, histamine receptors, 5-HT receptors, in addition to other receptors."
316,"Vincristine is an antitumor vinca alkaloid isolated from Vinca Rosea. It is marketed under several brand names, many of which have different formulations such as Marqibo (liposomal injection) and Vincasar. Vincristine is indicated for the treatment of acute leukaemia, malignant lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, acute erythraemia, and acute panmyelosis. The vinca alkaloids are structurally similar compounds comprised of 2 multiringed units, vindoline and catharanthine. The vinca alkaloids have become clinically useful since the discovery of their antitumour properties in 1959."
317,"Benazepril, brand name Lotensin, is a medication used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension), congestive heart failure, and chronic renal failure. Upon cleavage of its ester group by the liver, benazepril is converted into its active form benazeprilat, a non-sulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.Benazepril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, is a prodrug which, when hydrolyzed by esterases to its active Benazeprilat, is used to treat hypertension and heart failure, to reduce proteinuria and renal disease in patients with nephropathies, and to prevent stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiac death in high-risk patients. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex.Benazeprilat, the active metabolite of Benazepril, competes with angiotensin I for binding at the angiotensin-converting enzyme, blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II. As angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor and a negative-feedback mediator for renin activity, lower concentrations result in a decrease in blood pressure and stimulation of baroreceptor reflex mechanisms, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion."
318,"In non-depressed individuals, amoxapine does not affect mood or arousal, but may cause sedation. TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. The antidepressant effects of TCAs are thought to be due to an overall increase in serotonergic neurotransmission. Amoxapine may be used to treat neurotic and reactive depressive disorders, endogenous and psychotic depression, and mixed symptoms of depression and anxiety or agitation.Amoxapine is a tricyclic antidepressant of the dibenzoxazepine class, chemically distinct from the dibenzodiazepines, dibenzocycloheptenes, and dibenzoxepines. The mechanism of its clinical action in man is not well understood."
319,"For the topical treatment of multiple actinic or solar keratoses. In the 5% strength it is also useful in the treatment of superficial basal cell carcinomas when conventional methods are impractical, such as with multiple lesions or difficult treatment sites. Fluorouracil injection is indicated in the palliative management of some types of cancer, including colon, esophageal, gastric, rectum, breast, biliary tract, stomach, head and neck, cervical, pancreas, renal cell, and carcinoid.A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid.Fluorouracil is an antineoplastic anti-metabolite. Anti-metabolites masquerade as purine or pyrimidine - which become the building blocks of DNA."
320,"When administered intravenously, it is indicated for the reversal or antagonism of the neuromuscular blocking effects of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. Pyridostigmine has also been used as a prophylactic agent against irreversible organophosphorus acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, primarily in a military capacity.Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease involving dysfunction at the neuromuscular junction, most commonly due to autoantibodies directed against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR), which results in muscle tone loss, muscle weakness, and fatigue. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have been the symptomatic treatment of choice in myasthenia gravis since the 1930s with the early use of  and . Administration of atropine is recommended in the case of a true cholinergic crisis or to counteract muscarinic/nicotinic effects such as bradycardia and excessive bronchial secretions.Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease involving dysfunction at the neuromuscular junction most commonly due to autoantibodies directed against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR), but also against other targets such as the muscle-specific kinase (MUSK), lipoprotein-related protein 4 (LRP4), or agrin. In addition to its use in myasthenia gravis and in reversing neuromuscular blocks, pyridostigmine is also a common first-line treatment in congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS), of which there are multiple subtypes caused by mutations in more than 30 distinct genes."
321,"For the treatment of anxiety and status epilepticus.Adinazolam (Deracyn®) is a benzodiazepine derivative with anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative, and antidepressant properties. Adinazolam was first developed to enhance the antidepressant effects of . It has never been approved by the FDA for clinical use.Adinazolam is a benzodiazepine derivative used to treat anxiety, status epilepticus, and for sedation induction and anterograde amnesia. Adinazolam binds with high affinity to the GABA benzodiazepine receptor complex. Considerable evidence suggest that the central pharmacologic/therapeutic actions of alprazolam are mediated via interaction with this receptor complex.Adinazolam binds to peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors which interact allosterically with GABA receptors."
322,"It is available as a tablet and is usually dosed twice daily. Another leukotriene receptor antagonist is montelukast (Singulair), which is usually taken just once daily. Zafirlukast blocks the action of the cysteinyl leukotrienes on the CysLT1 receptors, thus reducing constriction of the airways, build-up of mucus in the lungs and inflammation of the breathing passages.Zafirlukast is a synthetic, selective peptide leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) indicated for the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma. Zafirlukast prevented intradermal LTD4-induced increases in cutaneous vascular permeability and inhibited inhaled LTD4-induced influx of eosinophils into animal lungs.Zafirlukast is a selective and competitive receptor antagonist of leukotriene D4 and E4 (LTD4 and LTE4), components of slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRSA). Cysteinyl leukotriene production and receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma, including airway edema, smooth muscle constriction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma."
323,Used to manage hyperthyroidism which is due to an overactive thyroid gland (Grave's disease).A thiourea antithyroid agent. Propythiouracil inhibits the synthesis of thyroxine and inhibits the peripheral conversion of throxine to tri-iodothyronine. PTU inhibits iodine and peroxidase from their normal interactions with thyroglobulin to form T4 and T3. The actions and use of propylthiouracil are similar to those of methimazole.Propylthiouracil binds to thyroid peroxidase and thereby inhibits the conversion of iodide to iodine. Therefore propylthiouracil effectively inhibits the production of new thyroid hormones.
324,"The drug is effective in the treatment of many lymphoproliferative malignancies, particularly hairy-cell leukemia. Intracellular activation results in incorporation into DNA as a false purine base. Cytotoxicity is cell cycle phase-specific (S-phase).Pentostatin is a potent transition state inhibitor of adenosine deaminase (ADA), the greatest activity of which is found in cells of the lymphoid system. Intracellular activation results in incorporation into DNA as a false purine base. Cytotoxicity is cell cycle phase-specific (S-phase)."
325,"For the treatment of psoriasis and vitiligoA naturally occurring furocoumarin compound found in several species of plants, including Psoralea corylifolia. It is a photoactive substance that forms DNA adducts in the presence of ultraviolet A irradiation.Methoxsalen selectively inhibits the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The guanine and cytosine content correlates with the degree of Methoxsalen-induced cross-linking. At high concentrations of the drug, cellular RNA and protein synthesis are also suppressed.After activation it binds preferentially to the guanine and cytosine moieties of DNA, leading to cross-linking of DNA, thus inhibiting DNA synthesis and function."
326,"For treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.A cyclooxygenase inhibiting, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAID) that is well established in treating rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis and used for musculoskeletal disorders, dysmenorrhea, and postoperative pain. Its long half-life enables it to be administered once daily.Piroxicam is in a class of drugs called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Piroxicam works by reducing hormones that cause inflammation and pain in the body. Piroxicam is used to reduce the pain, inflammation, and stiffness caused by rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.The antiinflammatory effect of Piroxicam may result from the reversible inhibition of cyclooxygenase, causing the peripheral inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. The prostaglandins are produced by an enzyme called Cox-1."
327,"It is also indicated for the process of conversion to drug monotherapy for those at least 16 years of age or older with partial seizures and currently are receiving treatment with carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or valproate as the single antiepileptic drug (AED). In addition to the above, lamotrigine is also indicated for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder, delaying the time to mood episodes (which may include mania, hypomania, depression, mixed episodes) in adults at least 18 years or older, who have been treated for acute mood symptoms with standard therapy. Limitations of use    It is important to note that lamotirigine should not be used in the treatment of acute mood episodes, as efficacy has not been established in this context.Lamotrigine is an antiepileptic drug belonging in the phenyltriazine class. While it is indicated for epilepsy and bipolar disorders, there is evidence that lamotrigine could have some clinical efficacy in certain neuropathic pain states.Lamotrigine likely prevents seizures and prevents mood symptoms via stabilizing presynaptic neuronal membranes and preventing the release of excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate, which contribute to seizure activity. Although this harmful metabolite is only found in trace amounts in humans, plasma concentrations may increase in conditions that cause decreased drug glucuronidation, such as liver disease.The exact mechanism of action of lamotrigine is not fully elucidated, as it may exert cellular activities that contribute to its efficacy in a range of conditions."
328,"It is also indicated in the treatment of histamine-mediated pruritus and pruritus due to allergic conditions such as chronic urticaria. Activity at off-targets also allows for its use as a sedative anxiolytic and an antiemetic in certain disease states. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes. Inverse agonism at these receptors is responsible for hydroxyzine's efficacy in the treatment of histaminic edema, flare, and pruritus. Hydroxyzine is not a cortical depressant, so its sedative properties likely occur at the subcortical level of the CNS."
329,"For the prevention and treatment of influenza A and B.A guanido-neuraminic acid that is used to inhibit neuraminidase.Zanamivir, an antiviral agent, is a neuraminidase inhibitor indicated for treatment of uncomplicated acute illness due to influenza A and B virus in adults and pediatric patients 7 years and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 2 days. Zanamivir has also been shown to significantly inhibit the human sialidases NEU3 and NEU2 in the micromolar range (Ki 3.7 +/-0.48 and 12.9+/-0.07 microM, respectively), which could account for some of the rare side effects of zanamivir.The proposed mechanism of action of zanamivir is via inhibition of influenza virus neuraminidase with the possibility of alteration of virus particle aggregation and release. By binding and inhibiting the neuraminidase protein, the drug renders the influenza virus unable to escape its host cell and infect others."
330,"Used in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), to improve exercise ability and to decrease the rate of clinical worsening (in patients with WHO Class III or IV symptoms).Bosentan is a dual endothelin receptor antagonist marketed under the trade name Tracleer by Actelion Pharmaceuticals. Patients with PAH have elevated levels of endothelin, a potent blood vessel constrictor, in their plasma and lung tissue. Bosentan blocks the binding of endothelin to its receptors, thereby negating endothelin's deleterious effects.Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a neurohormone, the effects of which are mediated by binding to ETA and ETB receptors in the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle. ET-1 concentrations are elevated in plasma and lung tissue of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, suggesting a pathogenic role for ET-1 in this disease. Bosentan is a specific and competitive antagonist at endothelin receptor types ETA and ETB."
331,"For the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the following conditions: Complicated skin and skin structure infections caused by Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only), Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible and -resistant isolates), Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus anginosus grp. Glycylcyclines are a new class of antibiotics derived from tetracycline. However, the glycylcyclines appear to bind more effectively than the tetracyclines.Tigecycline, a glycylcycline, inhibits protein translation in bacteria by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit and blocking entry of amino-acyl tRNA molecules into the A site of the ribosome. Tigecycline is not affected by the two major tetracycline resistance mechanisms, ribosomal protection and efflux. In vitro studies have not demonstrated antagonism between tigecycline and other commonly used antibacterial drugs."
332,"For use as a temporary measure in hospitalized patients with acute respiratory insufficiency superimposed on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.A central respiratory stimulant with a brief duration of action. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmocopoeia, 30th ed, p1225)Doxapram is an analeptic agent (a stimulant of the central nervous system). The respiratory stimulant action is manifested by an increase in tidal volume associated with a slight increase in respiratory rate. A pressor response may result following doxapram administration. The pressor response is due to the improved cardiac output rather than peripheral vasoconstriction."
333,"For the treatment of high blood pressure and management of edema.Benzthiazide is used to treat hypertension and edema. Thiazides also cause loss of potassium and an increase in serum uric acid. Thiazides cause vasodilation by activating calcium-activated potassium channels (large conductance) in vascular smooth muscles and inhibiting various carbonic anhydrases in vascular tissue.Benzthiazide is used to treat hypertension and edema. Thiazides also cause loss of potassium and an increase in serum uric acid. Thiazides cause vasodilation by activating calcium-activated potassium channels (large conductance) in vascular smooth muscles and inhibiting various carbonic anhydrases in vascular tissue.As a diuretic, benzthiazide inhibits active chloride reabsorption at the early distal tubule via the Na-Cl cotransporter, resulting in an increase in the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water."
334,"Methotrexate injections for subcutaneous use are indicated for severe active rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and severe, recalcitrant, disabling psoriasis. This inhibition leads to suppression of inflammation as well as prevention of cell division. Because of these effects, methotrexate is often used to treat inflammation caused by arthritis or to control cell division in neoplastic diseases such as breast cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Methotrexate was granted FDA approval on 7 December 1953.Methotrexate inhibits enzymes responsible for nucleotide synthesis which prevents cell division and leads to anti-inflammatory actions. It has a long duration of action and is generally given to patients once weekly."
335,"Carbamazepine is also indicated for the treatment of manic episodes and mixed manic-depressive episodes caused by bipolar I disorder. Some off-label, unapproved uses of carbamazepine include the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome and restless leg syndrome.Carbamazepine, also known as Tegretol, is an anticonvulsant drug and analgesic drug used to control seizures and to treat pain resulting from trigeminal neuralgia. It was initially approved by the FDA in 1965. **General effects**    Carbamazepine treats seizures and the symptoms of trigeminal neuralgia by inhibiting sodium channels. A potential therapeutic target to combat carbamazepine resistance has recently been identified as the EPHX1 gene promoter, potentially conferring resistance to carbamazepine through methylation."
336,"Cephalexin is indicated for the treatment of certain infections caused by susceptible bacteria. These infections include respiratory tract infections, otitis media, skin and skin structure infections, bone infections, and genitourinary tract infections.Cephalexin is the first of the first generation cephalosporins. This antibiotic contains a  beta lactam and a dihydrothiazide. Cephalexin is used to treat a number of susceptible bacterial infections through inhibition of cell wall synthesis. It is effective against most gram-positive bacteria through its inihibition of the cross linking reaction between N-acetyl muramicacid and N-acetylglucosamine in the cell wall, leading to cell lysis.Cephalexin is a first generation cephalosporin antibiotic."
337,"Cinnarizine is a specific calcium channel blocker that primarily works on the central vestibular system to interfere with the signal transmission between vestibular apparatus of the inner ear and the vomiting centre of the hypothalamus. Cinnarizine could be also viewed as a nootropic drug because of its vasorelaxating abilities (due to calcium channel blockage), which happen mostly in brain. Histamines mediate a number of activities such as contraction of smooth muscle of the airways and gastrointestinal tract, vasodilatation, cardiac stimulation, secretion of gastric acid, promotion of interleukin release and chemotaxis of eosinophils and mast cells. Cinnarizine through its calcium channel blocking ability also inhibits stimulation of the vestibular system.Cinnarizine inhibits contractions of vascular smooth muscle cells by blocking L-type and T-type voltage gated calcium channels. Cinnarizine has also been implicated in binding to dopamine D2 receptors, histamine H1 receptors, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors."
338,"Propranolol is indicated to treat hypertension. Propranolol is used to treat a number of conditions but most commonly is used for hypertension. Propranolol has a long duration of action as it is given once or twice daily depending on the indication. When patients abruptly stop taking propranolol, they may experience exacerbations of angina and myocardial infarctions.Propranolol is a nonselective β-adrenergic receptor antagonist. Blocking of these receptors leads to vasoconstriction, inhibition of angiogenic factors like vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic growth factor of fibroblasts (bFGF), induction of apoptosis of endothelial cells, as well as down regulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system."
339,"The intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intraosseous and endotracheal use of atropine is indicated for the temporary blockade of severe or life-threatening muscarinic effects. Atropine is a competitive, reversible antagonist of muscarinic receptors that blocks the effects of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Compared to , atropine has a more potent and prolonged effect on the heart, intestine and bronchial muscle, but a weaker effect on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands. Atropine can be used to prevent or abolish bradycardia or asystole induced by the injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Also, it acts in less innervated smooth muscle that responds to endogenous acetylcholine."
340,"It is pharmacologically similar to aspirin, but causes less gastrointestinal bleeding.Fenoprofen is a propionic acid derivative with analgesic, antiinflammatory and antipyretic properties. Fenoprofen inhibits prostaglandin synthesis by decreasing the enzyme needed for biosynthesis. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the anti-inflammatory action of fenoprofen has been evidenced by relief of pain, increase in grip strength, and reductions in joint swelling, duration of morning stiffness, and disease activity (as assessed by both the investigator and the patient). In patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, clinical studies have shown fenoprofen to be comparable to aspirin in controlling the aforementioned measures of disease activity, but mild gastrointestinal reactions (nausea, dyspepsia) and tinnitus occurred less frequently in patients treated with fenoprofen than in aspirin-treated patients. In patients with pain, the analgesic action of fenoprofen has produced a reduction in pain intensity, an increase in pain relief, improvement in total analgesia scores, and a sustained analgesic effect.Fenoprofen's exact mode of action is unknown, but it is thought that prostaglandin synthetase inhibition is involved."
341,"Fenfluramine is indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome and  Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in patients aged two years and older.Dravet syndrome is a pediatric encephalopathy that typically manifests within the first year of life following exposure to elevated temperatures. It is characterized by recurrent pharmacoresistant seizures, which increase in frequency and severity with disease progression. Through its ability to modulate neurotransmission, fenfluramine has reemerged as an effective therapy against pharmacoresistant seizures, such as those involved in Dravet syndrome. Fenfluramine should be gradually withdrawn following treatment alteration or cessation.Dravet syndrome is a complex pediatric encephalopathy characterized by recurrent pharmacoresistant seizures of variable type, delayed development, and in many cases, impairment in speech, language, gait, and other neurocognitive functions. Various _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ studies have demonstrated that fenfluramine is capable of acting as an agonist of multiple serotonin receptors including 5-HT1A, 5-HT1D, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C, as well as a σ1 receptor antagonist."
342,"An extended release tablet of clonidine is indicated for the treatment of ADHD either alone or in combination with other medications.Clonidine is an imidazole derivate that acts as an agonist of alpha-2 adrenoceptors. Clonidine was granted FDA approval on 3 September 1974.Clonidine functions through agonism of alpha-2 adrenoceptors which have effects such as lowering blood pressure, sedation, and hyperpolarization of nerves. The alpha-2 adrenoceptor is coupled to the G-proteins Go and Gi. Gu inhibits adenylyl cyclase and activates opening of a potassium channel that causes hyperpolarization. Ciding to the alpha-2 adrenoceptor causes structural changes in the alpha subunit of the G-protein, reducing its affinity for GDP."
343,"The sulfonamides are synthetic bacteriostatic antibiotics with a wide spectrum against most gram-positive and many gram-negative organisms. However, many strains of an individual species may be resistant. Bacterial sensitivity is the same for the various sulfonamides, and resistance to one sulfonamide indicates resistance to all. Their antibacterial action is inhibited by pus.Sulfamethizole is a competitive inhibitor of bacterial enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase. The inhibited reaction is necessary in these organisms for the synthesis of folic acid."
344,"Valacyclovir is a nucleoside analog DNA polymerase inhibitor indicated for :     **Adults**    �?Cold Sores (Herpes Labialis)    �?Genital Herpes    �?Treatment of genital herpes lesions in immunocompetent patients (initial or recurrent episode)    �?Suppression of genital herpes lesions in immunocompetent or HIV-infected patients    �?Reduction of viral transmission    �?Herpes Zoster    **Pediatric Patients**     �?Cold Sores (Herpes Labialis)    �?Chickenpox         **Limitations of use**     The efficacy and safety of valacyclovir have not been established in immunocompromised patients other than for the suppression of genital herpes in HIV-infected patients. It is caused by infection with the herpes simplex virus (HSV). The average duration of cold sore episodes was approximately 1 day shorter in treated subjects when compared to subjects treated with placebo. _Recurrent genital herpes episodes_    The results of 3 separate studies of patients taking  3 to 5-day regimens of valacyclovir showed an average of 4 days to lesion healing, 2-3 days to resolution of pain associated with the lesions, with an average of 2 days until the cessation of viral shedding . The first stage of drug phosphorylation for acyclovir requires activation by a virus-specific enzyme."
345,"For the treatment of acute and chronic infections of the upper and lower urinary tract and in asymptomatic bacteriuria due to susceptible strains of bacteria.Broad-spectrum semisynthetic penicillin derivative used parenterally. It is susceptible to gastric juice and penicillinase and may damage platelet function.Carbenicillin is a semisynthetic penicillin. Because of the high urine levels obtained following administration, carbenicillin has demonstrated clinical efficacy in urinary infections due to susceptible strains of: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris,Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas species, Providencia rettgeri, Enterobacter species, and Enterococci (S. faecalis).Free carbenicillin is the predominant pharmacologically active fraction of the salt. Carbenicillin exerts its antibacterial activity by interference with final cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. Penicillins acylate the penicillin-sensitive transpeptidase C-terminal domain by opening the lactam ring."
346,"Used in short-term (a few weeks) treatment of exogenous obesity in conjunction with a regimen of weight reduction based on caloric restriction, exercise, and behavior modification in patients with a body mass index of 30 kg of body weight per height in meters squared (kg/m2) or in patients with a body mass index of 27 kg/m2 in the presence of risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia.Mazindol is a tricyclic anorexigenic agent that is unrelated to and less toxic than , but with some similar side effects. It inhibits uptake of catecholamines and blocks the binding of cocaine to the dopamine uptake transporter. Mazindol is only approved in the United States for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and is not marketed or available in the United States for use in the treatment of obesity.Mazindol is a sympathomimetic amine that stimulates the central nervous system (nerves and brain), leading to increased your heart rate and blood pressure, and decreased appetite. Since the appetite-suppressing effect of the drug tends to decrease after few weeks of treatment, sympathomimetic appetite suppressants are typically used short-term weight-loss program. Unlike other sympathomimetic appetite suppressants such as phentermine, mazindol is thought to inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine rather than to cause its release."
347,"Lactulose is indicated for use as a laxative in the treatment of chronic constipation in adults and geriatric patients. Moreover, there have also been studies demonstrating the capacity for lactulose to minimize the formation of gallstones and even some investigations regarding the experimental use of the agent in developing novel anticancer agents owing to its ability to bind galactin carbohydrates involved in various tumor progressions .Lactulose is a synthetic disaccharide derivative of lactose that is most commonly used as a laxative agent despite also being formally indicated to serve as an adjunct therapy in treating portal-systemic encephalopathy (PSE). Nevertheless, although lactulose received formal FDA approval in 1977 and has since become a readily available generic and brand-name non-prescription medication listed on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines as one of the most effective and safe medicines employed in a health system, data regarding its optimal place in therapy is often ambiguous. Especially considering the use of lactulose as a laxative is typically only considered after lifestyle and dietary modifications fail and the fact that lactulose therapy cannot be ethically withheld from patients diagnosed with PSE in a placebo study, the substance may just be one of many options available for treating constipation and its efficacy in managing PSE may never be formally confirmed or refuted via clinical investigation.Lactulose formulations are most commonly administered via the oral route or the rectal route. At the same time, the formation of such acids via the metabolism of lactulose by colonic bacteria also acidifies the contents of the colon, thereby contributing to the treatment of portal-systemic encephalopathy (PSE)."
348,"For the treatment of esophageal candidiasis, cadidemia, invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, and serious fungal infections caused by Scedosporium apiospermum and Fusarium spp. The increased affinity of voriconazole for 14-alpha sterol demethylase makes it useful against some -resistant organisms. It is known to cause hepatotoxic and photosensitivity reactions in some patients.Voriconazole is used to treat fungal infections caused by a variety of organisms but including _Aspergillus spp._ and _Candida spp_. The lack of sufficient ergosterol disrupts fungal cell membrane function and limits fungal cell growth. With fungal growth limited, the host's immune system is able to clear the invading organism."
349,"Parenteral levocarnitine is indicated for the prevention and treatment of carnitine deficiency in patients with end-stage renal disease.Constituent of striated muscle and liver. It is used therapeutically to stimulate gastric and pancreatic secretions and in the treatment of hyperlipoproteinemias.Levocarnitine is a carrier molecule in the transport of long chain fatty acids across the inner mitochondrial membrane. It also exports acyl groups from subcellular organelles and from cells to urine before they accumulate to toxic concentrations. Further, this condition may be associated with a plasma concentration ratio of acylcarnitine/levocarnitine greater than 0.4 or abnormally elevated concentrations of acylcarnitine in the urine. Levocarnitine can be used therapeutically to stimulate gastric and pancreatic secretions and in the treatment of hyperlipoproteinemias.Levocarnitine can be synthesised within the body from the amino acids lysine or methionine."
350,"Indicated for the treatment of symptomatic congestive heart failure, usually in combination with diuretics and digitalis. Indicated for the management of asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction in patients with an ejection fraction of �?to 35 percent to decrease the rate of development of overt heart failure and the incidence of hospitalization for heart failure.Enalapril is a prodrug belonging to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor drug class that works on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which is responsible for the regulation of blood pressure and fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. The active metabolite of enalapril competitively inhibits the ACE to hinder the production of angiotensin II, a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system that promotes vasoconstriction and renal reabsorption of sodium ions in the kidneys. Enalapril is a pharmacologically inactive prodrug that requires hepatic biotransformation to form , its active metabolite that works on the RAAS to inhibit ACE. While inhibition of ACE leading to suppression of RAAS is thought to be the primary mechanism of action of enalapril, the drug was shown to still exert antihypertensive effects on individuals with low-renin hypertension."
351,"For the treatment of acid-reflux disorders (GERD), peptic ulcer disease, active benign gastric ulcer, and active duodenal ulcer.A histamine H2 receptor antagonist with low toxicity that inhibits gastric acid secretion. The drug is used for the treatment of duodenal ulcers.Nizatidine is a competitive, reversible inhibitor of histamine at the histamine H2-receptors, particularly those in the gastric parietal cells. Nizatidine had no demonstrable antiandrogenic action. It has been demonstrated that treatment with a reduced dose of nizatidine is effective as maintenance therapy following healing of active duodenal ulcers.Nizatidine competes with histamine for binding at the H2-receptors on the gastric basolateral membrane of parietal cells. The drug also decreases the gastric acid response to stimuli such as food, caffeine, insulin, betazole, or pentagastrin."
352,"Diclofenac was the product of rational drug design based on the structures of , , and . It also increases the risk of developing a gastrointestinal ulcer by inhibiting the production of protective mucus in the stomach.Diclofenac inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 and -2, the enzymes responsible for production of prostaglandin (PG) G2 which is the precursor to other PGs. The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents. PGI2 and PGE2 contribute to acute inflammation via their IP and EP2 receptors. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation."
353,"Fluticasone propionate is indicated as an inhaler for the treatment and management of asthma by prophylaxisas well as inflammatory and pruritic dermatoses. Fluticasone propionate nasal spray is indicated for managing allergic and nonallergic rhinitis.Fluticasone propionate is a synthetic glucocorticoid. These drugs are available as inhalers, nasal, sprays, and topical treatments for various inflammatory indications. Fluticasone propionate was first approved in 1990.Systemically, fluticasone propionate activates glucocorticoid receptors, and inhibits lung eosinophilia in rats. Fluticasone propionate as a topical formulation is also associated with vasoconstriction in the skin.Fluticasone propionate works through an unknown mechanism to  affect the action of various cell types and mediators of inflammation."
354,"For the management of Parkinson's DiseaseAn ergot derivative that acts as an agonist at dopamine D2 receptors (dopamine agonists). It may also act as an antagonist at dopamine D1 receptors, and as an agonist at some serotonin receptors (serotonin agonists).There is evidence that lisuride lowers prolactin levels and, in low doses, prevents migraine attacks. Lisuride is an anti-Parkinson drug chemically related to the dopaminergic ergoline Parkinson's drugs. Lisuride binds to the 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A/2C) receptors. It is also thought to bind to the dopamine receptor and to act as a dopamine agonist."
355,"Doxazosin is indicated to treat the symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy, which may include urinary frequency, urgency, and nocturia, among other symptoms. It is marketed by Pfizer and was initially approved by the FDA in 1990.Doxazosin decreases standing and supine blood pressure and relieves the symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy through the inhibition of alpha-1 receptors. The first dose of doxazosin may lead to such effects, however, subsequent doses may also cause them. Patients must be advised of the priapism risk associated with doxazosin and to seek medical attention immediately if it is suspected.Doxazosin selectively inhibits the postsynaptic alpha-1 receptors on vascular smooth muscle by nonselectively blocking the alpha-1a, alpha-1b, and alpha-1d subtypes. Norepinephrine-activated alpha-1 receptors located on the prostate gland and bladder neck normally cause contraction of regional muscular tissue, obstructing urinary flow and contributing to the symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy."
356,"-It has been used in shampoo products as a low to medium potency corticosteroid for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp. -As an intravitreal implant, it is indicated for the treatment of diabetic macular edema with patients that have been previously treated with a course of corticosteroids and no clinically significant rise in intraocular pressure. -Some reports have indicated the use of fluocinolone acetonide as a vasoprotective agent and for its use in the treatment of first-degree hemorrhoids.Fluocinolone acetonide, with the formula 6-alpha, 9-alpha-difluoro-16-alpha, 17 alpha-acetonide, is a corticosteroid that presents a high lipophilicity. This type of device containing fluocinolone acetonide was developed by Taro Pharmaceuticals and approved by FDA in May 2016.Fluocinolone acetonide is a synthetic anti-inflammatory corticosteroid and thus, the effect of its interaction with the body produces vasoconstriction and suppression of membrane permeability, mitotic activity, immune response and release of inflammatory mediators. Hence, the induction of these proteins will prevent the release of arachidonic acid by phospholipase A2."
357,"First used as a solvent for uric acid, the use of piperazine as an anthelmintic agent was first introduced in 1953. Upon entry into the systemic circulation, the drug is partly oxidized and partly eliminated as an unchanged compound. Piperazine compounds mediate their anthelmintic action by generally paralyzing parasites, allowing the host body to easily remove or expel the invading organism.Piperazine is an anthelminthic especially useful in the treatment of partial intestinal obstruction caused by Ascaris worms, which is a condition primarily seen in children. Piperazine hydrate and piperazine citrate are the main anthelminthic piperazines.Piperazine is a GABA receptor agonist. Piperzine binds directly and selectively to muscle membrane GABA receptors, presumably causing hyperpolarization of nerve endings, resulting in flaccid paralysis of the worm."
358,"For the treatment of petit mal epilepsy.An anticonvulsant especially useful in the treatment of absence seizures unaccompanied by other types of seizures.Used in the treatment of epilepsy. Ethosuximide suppresses the paroxysmal three cycle per second spike and wave activity associated with lapses of consciousness which is common in absence (petit mal) seizures. The frequency of epileptiform attacks is reduced, apparently by depression of the motor cortex and elevation of the threshold of the central nervous system to convulsive stimuli.Binds to T-type voltage sensitive calcium channels. Voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) mediate the entry of calcium ions into excitable cells and are also involved in a variety of calcium-dependent processes, including muscle contraction, hormone or neurotransmitter release, gene expression, cell motility, cell division and cell death. The isoform alpha-1G gives rise to T-type calcium currents."
359,"For use as adjunctive treatment with thiazide diuretics or other kaliuretic-diuretic agents in congestive heart failure or hypertension.A pyrazine compound inhibiting sodium reabsorption through sodium channels in renal epithelial cells. This inhibition creates a negative potential in the luminal membranes of principal cells, located in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct. Amiloride is used in conjunction with diuretics to spare potassium loss. It is an antihypertensive, potassium-sparing diuretic that was first approved for use in 1967 and helps to treat hypertension and congestive heart failure. Amiloride exerts its potassium sparing effect through the inhibition of sodium reabsorption at the distal convoluted tubule, cortical collecting tubule and collecting duct; this decreases the net negative potential of the tubular lumen and reduces both potassium and hydrogen secretion and their subsequent excretion."
360,Labetalol is formulated as an injection or tablets to treat hypertension. Labetalol was granted FDA approval on 1 August 1984.Labetalol antagonizes various adrenergic receptors to decrease blood pressure. Antagonism of alpha-1-adrenergic receptors leads to vasodilation and decreased vascular resistance. This leads to a decrease in blood pressure that is most pronounced while standing. Antagonism of beta-1-adrenergic receptors leads to a slight decrease in heart rate.
361,"Examples of susceptible bacteria include _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, _Streptococcus pyogenes_, and _Streptococcus agalactiae_. Linezolid is not indicated for the treatment of Gram-negative infections, nor has it been evaluated for use longer than 28 days.Linezolid is a synthetic antibiotic which is used for the treatment of infections caused by aerobic Gram-positive bacteria. Linezolid has shown some _in vitro_ activity against Gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria but is not considered efficacious against these organisms. Linezolid is a reversible and non-selective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzymes and can therefore contribute to the development of serotonin syndrome when administered alongside serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Point mutations in the bacterial 23S rRNA can lead to linezolid resistance, and the development of linezolid-resistant _Enterococcus faecium_ and _Staphylococcus aureus_ have been documented during its clinical use."
362,"months of age. Ivermectin is mainly used in humans in the treatment of onchocerciasis, but may also be effective against other worm infestations (such as strongyloidiasis, ascariasis, trichuriasis and enterobiasis). Applied topically, it may be used in the treatment of head lice infestation. With the advent of 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic, ivermectin began garnering notoriety due to its off-label use for the prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19. It is an avermectin, a group of pentacyclic sixteen-membered lactones (i.e. a macrocyclic lactone disaccharide) derived from the soil bacterium _Streptomyces avermitilis_."
363,"MPA can be use to treat secondary amenorrhea, endometrial hyperplasia, abnormal uterine bleeding, osteoporosis, vasomotor symptoms in menopause, vulvar and vaginal atrophy, prevent pregnancy, manage pain in endometriosis, prevent pregnancy, and is also used in palliative care for endometrial and renal carcinoma. Medroxyprogesterone acetate was granted FDA approval on 18 June 1959.Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) inhibits gonadotropin production, reduces nuclear estrogen receptors and DNA synthesis in epithelial cells of the endometrium, and induces p53 dependant apoptosis in cancer cell lines. The therapeutic window is wide as patients may take doses ranging from 5mg orally daily to 1000mg as a depo injection weekly. Long term use of MPA is associated with a reduction in bone density and patients who taking MPA during adolescence may have lower peak bone mass than untreated patients, which can also increase the risk of osteoporosis and fractures in the future.Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) inhibits the production of gonadotropin, preventing follicular maturation and ovulation, which is responsible for it’s ability to prevent pregnancy. MPA reduces nuclear estrogen receptors and DNA synthesis in epithelial cells of the endometrium."
364,"For the symptomatic treatment of adult patients with nocturnal heartburn due to gastroesophageal reflux disease.In many countries (including Canada) cisapride has been either withdrawn or has had its indications limited due to reports about long QT syndrome due to cisapride, which predisposes to arrhythmias. The FDA issued a warning letter regarding this risk to health care professionals and patients.Cisapride is a parasympathomimetic which acts as a serotonin 5-HT<sub>4</sub> agonist; upon activation of the receptor signaling pathway, cisapride promotes the release of acetylcholine neurotransmitters in the enteric nervous system. Cisapride stimulates motility of the upper gastrointestinal tract without stimulating gastric, biliary, or pancreatic secretions. Cisapride increases the tone and amplitude of gastric (especially antral) contractions, relaxes the pyloric sphincter and the duodenal bulb, and increases peristalsis of the duodenum and jejunum resulting in accelerated gastric emptying and intestinal transit. It has little, if any, effect on the motility of the colon or gallbladder."
365,"For acute or long-term use in the relief of signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, acute painful shoulder (acute subacromial bursitis/supraspinatus tendinitis), and acute gouty arthritis.Sulindac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of the arylalkanoic acid class that is marketed by Merck under the brand name Clinoril. Like other NSAIDs, it may be used in the treatment of acute or chronic inflammatory conditions. Sulindac is a prodrug, derived from sulfinylindene, that is converted _in vivo_ to an active sulfide compound by liver enzymes. There is evidence from some studies that sulindac may be associated with fewer gastrointestinal side effects than other NSAIDs, except for the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor drug class. While its full mechanism of action is not fully understood, sulindac is thought to primarily mediate its action by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2.Sulindac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory indene derivative, also possessing analgesic and antipyretic activities.Sulindac's exact mechanism of action is unknown."
366,"It is also indicated in the management of hypertension either as the sole therapeutic agent or to enhance the effectiveness of other antihypertensive drugs in the more severe forms of hypertension.As a diuretic, cyclothiazide inhibits active chloride reabsorption at the early distal tubule via the Na-Cl cotransporter, resulting in an increase in the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water. Natriuresis may be accompanied by some loss of potassium and bicarbonate.Hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, inhibits water reabsorption in the nephron by inhibiting the sodium-chloride symporter (SLC12A3) in the distal convoluted tubule, which is responsible for 5% of total sodium reabsorption. Once sodium has entered the cell, it is transported out into the basolateral interstitium via the sodium-potassium ATPase, causing an increase in the osmolarity of the interstitium, thereby establishing an osmotic gradient for water reabsorption. By blocking the sodium-chloride symporter, hydrochlorothiazide effectively reduces the osmotic gradient and water reabsorption throughout the nephron.Hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, inhibits water reabsorption in the nephron by inhibiting the sodium-chloride symporter (SLC12A3) in the distal convoluted tubule, which is responsible for 5% of total sodium reabsorption. Once sodium has entered the cell, it is transported out into the basolateral interstitium via the sodium-potassium ATPase, causing an increase in the osmolarity of the interstitium, thereby establishing an osmotic gradient for water reabsorption."
367,"A semi-synthetic antibiotic related to penicillin, Naficillin is a narrow-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotic drug. It is a beta-lactamase-resistant penicillin that is indicated for the treatment of Staphylococcal infections caused by strains that are resistant to other penicillins, except those caused by MRSA. It may be used as a first-line therapy in Methicillin-Sensitive *Staphylococcus aureus* infections .Nafcillin is a semisynthetic antibiotic substance derived from 6-amino-penicillanic acid. The drugs in this class are highly resistant to inactivation by staphylococcal penicillinase and are active against penicillinase-producing and non penicillinase-producing strains of Staphylococcus species. It inhibits the biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall by forming covalent bonds with penicillin-binding proteins that play a critical role in the final transpeptidation process."
368,"Chloroquine is also used off label for the treatment of rheumatic diseases, as well as treatment and prophylaxis of Zika virus. Chloroquine is currently undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19.Chloroquine is an aminoquinolone derivative first developed in the 1940s for the treatment of malaria. It was the drug of choice to treat malaria until the development of newer antimalarials such as , , and . The raised pH in endosomes, prevent virus particles from utilizing their activity for fusion and entry into the cell. Chloroquine does not affect the level of ACE2 expression on cell surfaces, but inhibits terminal glycosylation of ACE2, the receptor that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 target for cell entry."
369,"For use in the treatment of pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis when other antitubercular drugs have failed.A second-line antitubercular agent that inhibits mycolic acid synthesis. tuberculosis</i>. In a study examining ethionamide resistance, ethionamide administered orally initially decreased the number of culturable <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> organisms from the lungs of H37Rv infected mice. It is thought that ethionamide undergoes intracellular modification and acts in a similar fashion to isoniazid. Specifically isoniazid inhibits InhA, the enoyl reductase from <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, by forming a covalent adduct with the NAD cofactor."
370,"It is used in the management of severe pain.Butorphanol is a synthetic opioid agonist-antagonist analgesic with a pharmacological and therapeutic profile that has been well established since its launch as a parenteral formulation in 1978. This route of administration bypasses the gastrointestinal tract, and this is an advantage for a drug such as butorphanol that undergoes significant first-pass metabolism after oral administration. The onset of action and systemic bioavailability of butorphanol following transnasal delivery are similar to those after parenteral administration. The opiate antagonistic effect may result from competitive inhibition at the opiate receptor, but may also be a result of other mechanisms. Butorphanol is believed to have both partial agonism and partial antagonism at the μ-opioid receptor, as well as partial agonist and antagonist activity at the κ-opioid receptor."
371,"It may be used off-label to treat heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and angina pectoris.Bisoprolol is a cardioselective β1-adrenergic blocking agent used to treat high blood pressure. Bisoprolol is generally well tolerated, likely due to its β1-adrenergic receptor selectivity and is a useful alternative to non-selective β-blocker drugs in the treatment of hypertension such as  and . It may be used alone or in combination with other drugs to manage hypertension and can be useful in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to its receptor selectivity.Bisoprolol decreases heart rate (chronotropy), decreases contractility (inotropy), and reduces blood pressure. Though the mechanism of action of bisoprolol has not been fully elucidated in hypertension, it is thought that therapeutic effects are achieved through the antagonism of β-1adrenoceptors to result in lower cardiac output. Bisoprolol reduces cardiac workload by decreasing contractility and the need for oxygen through competitive inhibition of β1-adrenergic receptors."
372,"For treatment of acute malarial attacks in non-immune subjects.A 4-aminoquinoquinoline compound with anti-inflammatory properties.Amodiaquine, a 4-aminoquinoline similar to chloroquine in structure and activity, has been used as both an antimalarial and an anti-inflammatory agent for more than 40 years. The mode of action of amodiaquine has not yet been determined. 4-Aminoquinolines depress cardiac muscle, impair cardiac conductivity, and produce vasodilatation with resultant hypotension. Like other quinoline derivatives, it is thought to inhibit heme polymerase activity. This results in accumulation of free heme, which is toxic to the parasites."
373,"For the prevention of disseminated <i>Mycobacterium avium</i> complex (MAC) disease in patients with advanced HIV infection.A broad-spectrum antibiotic that is being used as prophylaxis against disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex infection in HIV-positive patients.Rifabutin is an antibiotic that inhibits DNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity in susceptible cells. Specifically, it interacts with bacterial RNA polymerase but does not inhibit the mammalian enzyme. It is bactericidal and has a very broad spectrum of activity against most gram-positive and gram-negative organisms (including <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>) and specifically <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>. Because of rapid emergence of resistant bacteria, use is restricted to treatment of mycobacterial infections and a few other indications. Rifabutin is well absorbed when taken orally and is distributed widely in body tissues and fluids, including the CSF."
374,"Used for the control of absence (petit mal) seizures that are refractory to treatment with other medications.Paramethadione is an anticonvulsant in the oxazolidinedione class. It is associated with fetal trimethadione syndrome, which is also known as paramethadione syndrome.Paramethadione is an oxazolidinedione anticonvulsant similar to trimethadione that acts on the central nervous system (CNS) to reduce the number of absence seizures (often seen in epileptics). Absence seizures involve an interruption to consciousness where the person experiencing the seizure seems to become vacant and unresponsive for a short period of time (usually up to 30 seconds). Paramethadione acts on thalamic neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus (which studies have shown to be associated with absence seizures, von Krosigk et al., 1993).Dione anticonvulsants such as paramethadione reduce T-type calcium currents in thalamic neurons (including thalamic relay neurons). This inhibits corticothalamic transmission and raises the threshold for repetitive activity in the thalamus."
375,"Used primarily to treat Lyme disease, acne, and bronchitis. Also indicated (but rarely used) to treat urinary tract infections, gum disease, malaria, and other bacterial infections such as gonorrhea and chlamydia. Demeclocycline is not a direct bactericidal agent; rather, it is a bacteriostatic drug that impairs bacterial growth. Because it is excreted more slowly than tetracycline, it maintains effective blood levels for longer periods of time.Demeclocycline inhibits cell growth by inhibiting translation. It is not completely understood why demeclocycline impairs the action of antidiuretic hormone, but it is thought that it blocks the binding of the hormone to its receptor."
376,"Imatinib is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric chronic myeloid leukemia with Philadelphia chromosome mutation (Ph+) in blast crisis, accelerated phase, or chronic phase after IFN-alpha therapy failure. Therefore, the BCR-ABL pathway is an attractive target for cancer treatment. Cancer cells, on the other hand, can have a dependence on BCR-ABL, thus more heavily impacted by imatinib. Imatinib mesylate is a protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, the constitutively active tyrosine kinase created by the Philadelphia chromosome abnormality in CML.Although the function of normal BCR is still unclear, ABL activation is overexpressed in various tumors and is heavily implicated in cancer cells growth and survival. Imatinib inhibits the BCR-ABL protein by binding to the ATP pocket in the active site, thus preventing downstream phosphorylation of target protein."
377,"Triamcinolone hexacetonide injections are indicated for intralesional administration in alopecia areata, discoid lupus erythematosus, keloids, and necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum. A triamcinolone intravitreal injection is indicated for the treatment of sympathetic ophthalmia, temporal arteritis, uveitis, and ocular inflammatory conditions. A triamcinolone acetonide suspension for injection into the suprachoroidal space is indicated for the treatment of macular edema associated with uveitis.Triamcinolone is a corticosteroid used to treat various inflammatory conditions in the body from allergic rhinitis to acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis. Triamcinolone can be used as a one time adjunct treatment of osteoarthritic knee pain, or first line as a topical treatment of corticosteroid responsive dermatoses. In October 2021, a suspension of triamcinolone acetonide was approved for suprachoroidal injection - the first suprachoroidal injection to receive FDA approval - for the treatment of patients with macular edema associated with uveitis.Triamcinolone is a corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory properties."
378,"Use to promote weight gain after weight loss following extensive surgery.A synthetic hormone with anabolic and androgenic properties.Oxandrolone is an anabolic steroids indicated as adjunctive therapy to promote weight gain after weight loss following extensive surgery, chronic infections, or severe trauma, and in some patients who without definite pathophysiologic reasons fail to gain or to maintain normal weight, to offset the protein catabolism associated with prolonged administration of corticosteroids, and for the relief of the bone pain frequently accompanying osteoporosis. Anabolic steroids are synthetic derivatives of testosterone.Oxandrolones interact with androgen receptors in target tissues."
379,"For management of manifestations of psychotic disorders.A phenothiazine used in the treatment of psychoses. Its properties and uses are generally similar to those of chlorpromazine.Fluphenazine is a trifluoro-methyl phenothiazine derivative intended for the management of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Fluphenazine has not been shown effective in the management of behaviorial complications in patients with mental retardation.Fluphenazine blocks postsynaptic mesolimbic dopaminergic D1 and D2 receptors in the brain; depresses the release of hypothalamic and hypophyseal hormones and is believed to depress the reticular activating system thus affecting basal metabolism, body temperature, wakefulness, vasomotor tone, and emesis."
380,"Testosterone is indicated to treat primary hypogonadism and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.Testosterone is a steroid sex hormone indicated to treat primary hypogonadism and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Testosterone antagonizes the androgen receptor to induce gene expression that causes the growth and development of masculine sex organs and secondary sexual characteristics. The duration of action of testosterone is variable from patient to patient with a half life of 10-100 minutes. The therapeutic index is wide considering the normal testosterone levels in an adult man range from 300-1000ng/dL. Counsel patients regarding the risk of secondary exposure of testosterone topical products to children.The androgen receptor exists in the cytoplasm bound to the heat shock proteins HSP90, HSP70, and other chaperones."
381,"For use in combination treatment of HIV infection (AIDS)Efavirenz (brand names Sustiva® and Stocrin®) is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) and is used as part of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for the treatment of a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1. For HIV infection that has not previously been treated, efavirenz and lamivudine in combination with zidovudine or tenofovir is the preferred NNRTI-based regimen. Currently, the CDC recommends that Efavirenz be given as part of a three-drug regimen that includes another nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (e.g., lamivudine, stavudine, zidovudine) and a protease inhibitor or efavirenz when treating HIV infection.Similar to zidovudine, efavirenz inhibits the activity of viral RNA-directed DNA polymerase (i.e., reverse transcriptase). Antiviral activity of efavirenz is dependent on intracellular conversion to the active triphosphorylated form. The rate of efavirenz phosphorylation varies, depending on cell type."
382,"Bacitracin is indicated in topical formulations for acute and chronic localized skin infections. Occasionally, it is also used intramuscularly for infantile streptococcal pneumonia and empyema. Bacitracin is also formulated as an ointment with neomycin and polymyxin B for over the counter use. Bacitracin was granted FDA approval on 29 July 1948.Bacitracin is a mixture of polypeptides that prevent the formation of the bacterial cell wall and oxidatively cleave DNA. Bacitracin metal complexes also bind and oxidatively cleave DNA."
383,"Niacin oral tablets are indicated as a monotherapy or in combination with simvastatin or lovastatin to treat primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. Finally niacin is indicated to treat severe hypertriglyceridemia.Niacin is a B vitamin used to treat vitamin deficiencies as well as hyperlipidemia, dyslipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and to reduce the risk of myocardial infarctions.Niacin is a B vitamin used to treat vitamin deficiencies as well as hyperlipidemia, dyslipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and to reduce the risk of myocardial infarctions. Niacin acts to decrease levels of very low density lipoproteins and low density lipoproteins, while increasing levels of high density lipoproteins. This activity also leads to intracellular degradation of apo B and decreased production of low density lipoproteins, the catabolic product of VLDL. Niacin also inhibits a high density lipoprotein (HDL) catabolism receptor, which increases the levels and half life of HDL."
384,"It is also used as adjunctive therapy in the management of partial seizures and for the symptomatic relief of acute alcohol withdrawal.Clorazepic acid (clorazepate) is a water-soluble benzodiazepine with muscle-relaxant and anticonvulsant actions effective in the treatment of anxiety. Following administration, clorazepate is rapidly converted to nordiazepam (N-desmethyldiazepam), its active metabolite, before entering systemic circulation. Similar to other benzodiazepines, the active metabolite of clorazepate enhances the binding of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to the GABA type A (GABA-A) receptor, which promotes channel opening and neuronal hyperpolarization. The use of benzodiazepines, including clorazepate, exposes users to abuse, misuse, and addiction risks, which can lead to overdose and death. The concomitant use of clorazepate with opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death.Clorazepate is a benzodiazepine with depressant effects on the central nervous system."
385,"Administered intravenously, dexmedetomidine is indicated for the sedation of initially intubated and mechanically ventilated patients during treatment in intensive care settings, and for the sedation of non-intubated patients prior to and/or during surgery and other procedures. It is also available as a buccally- or sublingually-administered dissolvable film for the acute treatment of agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar I or II disorder.An agonist of receptors, adrenergic alpha-2 that is used in veterinary medicine for its analgesic and sedative properties. It is the racemate of dexmedetomidine.Dexmedetomidine activates 2-adrenoceptors, and causes the decrease of sympathetic tone, with attenuation of the neuroendocrine and hemodynamic responses to anesthesia and surgery; it reduces anesthetic and opioid requirements; and causes sedation and analgesia.Dexmedetomidine is a specific and selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist. By binding to the presynaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptors, it inhibits the release if norepinephrine, therefore, terminate the propagation of pain signals. Activation of the postsynaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptors inhibits the sympathetic activity decreases blood pressure and heart rate."
386,"For the treatment of bacterial vaginitis, keratitis, acute conjunctivitis, and blepharitis.An anti-infective agent that is used topically to treat skin infections and orally for urinary tract infections.Sulfacetamide is a sulfonamide antibiotic with bacteriostatic actions and broad-spectrum activity against most gram-positive and many gram-negative organisms. However, many strains of an individual species may be resistant. The sulfonamides are widely distributed throughout all tissues. High levels are achieved in pleural, peritoneal, synovial, and ocular fluids. Their antibacterial action is inhibited by pus.Sulfacetamide is a competitive inhibitor of bacterial para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), an essential component for bacterial growth (according to the Woods-Fildes theory)."
387,"Prednisone is indicated as an anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive drug for allergic, dermatologic, gastrointestinal, hematologic, ophthalmologic, nervous system, renal, respiratory, rheumatologic, infectious, endocrine, or neoplastic conditions as well as in organ transplant.A synthetic anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid derived from . It is biologically inert and converted to  in the liver. Prednisone was granted FDA approval on 21 February 1955.Corticosteroids bind to the glucocorticoid receptor, inhibiting pro-inflammatory signals, and promoting anti-inflammatory signals. Prednisone has a short duration of action as the half life is 2-3 hours. Corticosteroids have a wide therapeutic window as patients make require doses that are multiples of what the body naturally produces."
388,"For Primary Dysbetalipoproteinemia (Type III hyperlipidemia) that does not respond adequately to diet. Serum cholesterol may be decreased, particularly in those patients whose cholesterol elevation is due to the presence of IDL as a result of Type III hyperlipoproteinemia. Increase in LDL cholesterol has been observed in patients whose cholesterol is initially normal. This is accompanied by a slight increase in secretion of lipids into the bile and ultimately the intestine. This agonism ultimately leads to modification in gene expression resulting in increased beta-oxidation, decreased triglyceride secretion, increased HDL, increased lipoprotein lipase activity."
389,"Astemizole was indicated for use in the relieving allergy symptoms, particularly rhinitis and conjunctivitis. It has been withdrawn from the market however due to concerns of arrhythmias.Astemizole is a long-acting, non-sedating second generation antihistamine used in the treatment of allergy symptoms. It does not significantly cross the blood brain barrier and therefore does not cause drowsiness or CNS depression at normal doses.Astemizole competes with histamine for binding at H1-receptor sites in the GI tract, uterus, large blood vessels, and bronchial muscle. As the drug does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier and preferentially binds at H1 receptors in the peripehery rather than within the brain, CNS depression is minimal. Astemizole may also act on H3-receptors, producing adverse effects."
390,"For the local treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (infections caused by Candida)Butoconazole is an imidazole antifungal used in gynecology.Butoconazole is an imidazole derivative that has fungicidal activity in vitro against Candida spp. and has been demonstrated to be clinically effective against vaginal infections due to Candida albicans. Candida albicans has been identified as the predominant species responsible for vulvovaginal candidasis.The exact mechanism of the antifungal action of butoconazole is unknown, however, it is presumed to function as other imidazole derivatives via inhibition of steroid synthesis. Imidazoles generally inhibit the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol via the inhibition of the enzyme cytochrome P450 14&alpha;-demethylase, resulting in a change in fungal cell membrane lipid composition. This structural change alters cell permeability and, ultimately, results in the osmotic disruption or growth inhibition of the fungal cell."
391,"It is also indicated to convert sinus rhythm of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.The structure of adenosine was first described in 1931, though the vasodilating effects were not described in literature until the 1940s. Adenosine was granted FDA approval on 30 October 1989.Adenosine is indicated as an adjunct to thallium-201 in myocardial perfusion scintigraphy and also indicated for conversion of sinus rhythm of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Adenosine has a short duration of action as the half life is <10 seconds, and a wide therapeutic window. Conduction time is decreased by inducing potassium efflux and inhibiting calcium influx through channels in nerve cells, leading to hyperpolarization and and increased threshold for calcium dependent action potentials. Inhibition of calcium influx, reduces the activity of adenylate cyclase, relaxing vascular smooth muscle."
392,"Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint,  is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg  per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decrease in LDL cholesterol levels, while simvastatin has been found to have an average decrease in LDL-C of ~35%. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors coadministered with , and caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing these two medications together. Once hydrolyzed, simvastatin competes with HMG-CoA for HMG-CoA reductase, a hepatic microsomal enzyme, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis."
393,"In the US, it is reserved for patients whose disease is unresectable or otherwise not candidates for curative surgery.Pemetrexed is a chemotherapy drug that is manufactured and marketed by Eli Lilly and Company under the brand name Alimta. Its use in non-small cell lung cancer has also been investigated. Based on population pharmacodynamic analyses, the depth of the absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) nadir correlates with systemic exposure to pemetrexed and supplementation with folic acid and vitamin B12. There is no cumulative effect of pemetrexed exposure on ANC nadir over multiple treatment cycles. The polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are inhibitors of TS and GARFT."
394,"For the treatment of <i>Enterobius vermicularis</i> (pinworm), <i>Trichuris trichiura</i> (whipworm), <i>Ascaris lumbricoides</i> (common roundworm), <i>Ancylostoma duodenale</i> (common hookworm), <i>Necator americanus</i> (American hookworm) in single or mixed infections.A benzimidazole that acts by interfering with carbohydrate metabolism and inhibiting polymerization of microtubules. Mebendazole is a (synthetic) broad-spectrum anthelmintic. The principal mode of action for Mebendazole is by its inhibitory effect on tubulin polymerization which results in the loss of cytoplasmic microtubules.Mebendazole causes degenerative alterations in the tegument and intestinal cells of the worm by binding to the colchicine-sensitive site of tubulin, thus inhibiting its polymerization or assembly into microtubules. The loss of the cytoplasmic microtubules leads to impaired uptake of glucose by the larval and adult stages of the susceptible parasites, and depletes their glycogen stores. Degenerative changes in the endoplasmic reticulum, the mitochondria of the germinal layer, and the subsequent release of lysosomes result in decreased production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the energy required for the survival of the helminth."
395,"It displays antitussive and local anaesthetic actions. Its general pharmacologic properties are those of the opiates as a group. The analgesic effect of propoxyphene is due to the d-isomer, dextropropoxyphene. It binds to the opiate receptors and leads to a decrease of the perception of pain stimuli. Propoxyphene primarily affects OP3 receptors, which are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as modulators, both positive and negative, of synaptic transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins."
396,"Mitotane is indicated for the treatment of inoperable, functional or nonfunctional, adrenocortical carcinoma.Mitotane is an adrenolytic isomer of the insecticide dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD) - itself a metabolite of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) - that inhibits cells of the adrenal cortex and their production of hormones. It has been in use since 1959 for the treatment of inoperable adrenocortical carcinoma and is used off-label for the management of Cushing's syndrome.The administration of mitotane alters the peripheral metabolism of steroids, leading to a reduction in plasma 17-hydroxycorticosteroids and an increase in 6-β-hydroxycortisol in addition to normal corticosteroid levels.The mechanism of action of mitotane is unknown, although data are available to suggest that the drug modifies the peripheral metabolism of steroids as well as directly suppressing the adrenal cortex. The specificity of mitotane towards the adrenal cortex may derive from the metabolic transformation to its active form via an enzyme system unique to the adrenal cortex tissue."
397,"For the treatment of human immunovirus (HIV) infections.A dideoxynucleoside analog that inhibits reverse transcriptase and has in vitro activity against HIV.Stavudine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) with activity against Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1). Stavudine is phosphorylated to active metabolites that compete for incorporation into viral DNA. They inhibit the HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme competitively and act as a chain terminator of DNA synthesis. The lack of a 3'-OH group in the incorporated nucleoside analogue prevents the formation of the 5' to 3' phosphodiester linkage essential for DNA chain elongation, and therefore, the viral DNA growth is terminated.Stavudine inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) both by competing with the natural substrate dGTP and by its incorporation into viral DNA."
398,"For relief of acute bronchial asthma and for reversible bronchospasm associated with chronic bronchitis and emphysema.Dyphylline is a theophylline derivative with broncho- and vasodilator properties. It is typically used in the management of asthma, cardiac dyspnea, and bronchitis.Dyphylline, a xanthine derivative, is a bronchodilator used for relief of acute bronchial asthma and for reversible bronchospasm associated with chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Dyphylline is a xanthine derivative with pharmacologic actions similar to theophylline and other members of this class of drugs. Its primary action is that of bronchodilation, but it also exhibits peripheral vasodilatory and other smooth muscle relaxant activity to a lesser degree.The bronchodilatory action of dyphylline, as with other xanthines, is thought to be mediated through competitive inhibition of phosphodiesterase with a resulting increase in cyclic AMP producing relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle as well as antagonism of adenosine receptors."
399,"For the relief of moderate to severe pain.The first mixed agonist-antagonist analgesic to be marketed. It is an agonist at the kappa and sigma opioid receptors and has a weak antagonist action at the mu receptor. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1991, p97)Pentazocine is a potent analgesic which when administered orally in a 50 mg dose appears equivalent in analgesic effect to 60 mg (1 grain) of codeine. Onset of significant analgesia usually occurs between 15 and 30 minutes after oral administration, and duration of action is usually three hours or longer. Onset and duration of action and the degree of pain relief are related both to dose and the severity of pretreatment pain."
400,"Also indicated for replacement therapy in magnesium deficiency, especially in acute hypomagnesemia accompanied by signs of tetany similar to those of hypocalcemia. It causes direct inhibition of action potentials in myometrial muscle cells. Excitation and contraction are uncoupled, which decreases the frequency and force of contractions. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1992, p1083)Magnesium sulfate is a small colorless crystal used as an anticonvulsant, a cathartic, and an electrolyte replenisher in the treatment of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. It causes direct inhibition of action potentials in myometrial muscle cells."
401,"Latanoprost is indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure in patients who have been diagnosed with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. In Canada, latanoprost is also indicated to treat elevated intraocular pressure due to angle-closure glaucoma that has been treated with peripheral iridotomy or laser iridoplasty.Latanoprost is a prodrug analog of prostaglandin F2 alpha that is used to treat elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). Latanoprost is the first topical prostaglandin F2 alpha analog used for glaucoma treatment. A decrease in intraocular pressure has been measured within 3�? Latanoprost selectively stimulates the prostaglandin F2 alpha receptor and this results in a decreased intraocular pressure (IOP) via the increased outflow of aqueous humor, which is often implicated in cases of elevated intraocular pressure."
402,"It is produced in vivo from androstenedione or from testosterone via estradiol. It is produced primarily in the ovaries, placenta, and in peripheral tissues (especially adipose tissue) through conversion of adrostenedione. Estrone is naturally derived from the peripheral conversion of androstenedione by an aromatase enzyme found in adipose tissues and is converted to estradiol in peripheral tissues. Estrone, and estropipate are used to treat abnormalities related to gonadotropin hormone dysfunction, vasomotor symptoms, atrophic vaginitis, and vulvar atrophy associated with menopause, and for the prevention of osteoporosis due to estrogen deficiency.Estrogens enter the cells of responsive tissues (e.g. female organs, breasts, hypothalamus, pituitary) where they interact with estrogen receptors. Hormone-bound estrogen receptors dimerize, translocate to the nucleus of cells and bind to estrogen response elements (ERE) of genes."
403,"It has been used off-label for adjunct therapy in alcohol dependence, and off-label to treat anxiety and insomnia. It may also be used off-label to treat symptoms of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, eating disorders, and fibromyalgia due to its effects on various neurotransmitter receptors.Trazodone is triazolopyridine derivative from the serotonin receptor antagonists and reuptake inhibitors (SARIs) class of antidepressants. It is used in adults and has been shown to be comparable in efficacy to other drugs such as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin-norepinephrine receptor inhibitor (SNRIs) in the treatment of depression. Patients must be advised to seek immediate medical attention if priapism is suspected.The mechanism of action of trazodone is not fully understood, however, it is known to inhibit the reuptake of serotonin and block both histamine and alpha-1-adrenergic receptors. In addition to acting on serotonin receptors, trazodone has been shown to inhibit serotonin transporters."
404,For the control of serum phosphorus in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) on hemodialysis.Sevelamer is a phosphate binding drug used to prevent hyperphosphataemia in patients with chronic renal failure. It is marketed by Genzyme under the trade name Renagel.Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) retain phosphorus and can develop hyperphosphatemia. High serum phosphorus can precipitate serum calcium resulting in ectopic calcification. An increase in parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels is characteristic of patients with chronic renal failure. A decrease in serum phosphorus may decrease serum PTH levels.
405,"Acamprosate is indicated for the maintenance of abstinence from alcohol in patients with alcohol dependence who are abstinent at treatment initiation. It is also indicated for the maintenance of alcohol abstinence in patients who have undergone alcohol detoxification. Acamprosate, also known by the brand name Campral, is a drug used for the maintenance of alcohol abstinence. Results of studies in animals suggest acamprosate may interact with glutamate and GABA neurotransmitter systems in the CNS, supporting the hypothesis that acamprosate restores the balance between neuronal excitation and inhibition. Evidence shows that acamprosate directly binds and inhibits GABA B receptors and indirectly affects GABA A receptors."
406,"Verapamil is indicated in the treatment of vasopastic (i.e. Prinzmetal's) angina, unstable angina, and chronic stable angina. It is a member of the non-dihydropyridine class of calcium channel blockers, which includes drugs like  and , but is chemically unrelated to other cardioactive medications. As verapamil is a negative inotropic medication (i.e. it decreases the strength of myocardial contraction), it should not be used in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as the decrease in contractility caused by verapamil may increase the risk of exacerbating these pre-existing conditions.Verapamil inhibits L-type calcium channels by binding to a specific area of their alpha-1 subunit,Cav1.2, which is highly expressed on L-type calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle and myocardial tissue where these channels are responsible for the control of peripheral vascular resistance and heart contractility. Inhibition of calcium influx prevents the contraction of vascular smooth muscle, causing relaxation/dilation of blood vessels throughout the peripheral circulation - this lowers systemic vascular resistance (i.e. afterload) and thus blood pressure. Verapamil's mechanism of action in the treatment of cluster headaches is unclear, but is thought to result from an effect on other calcium channels (e.g. N-, P-, Q-, or T-type)."
407,"For the treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting and for nausea associated with gastroenteritis.Trimethobenzamide is a novel antiemetic which prevents nausea and vomiting in humans. Its actions are unclear but most likely involves the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ). In dogs pretreated with trimethobenzamide HCl, the emetic response to apomorphine is inhibited, while little or no protection is afforded against emesis induced by intragastric copper sulfate.Trimethobenzamide is a novel antiemetic which prevents nausea and vomiting in humans. Its actions are unclear but most likely involves the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ). In dogs pretreated with trimethobenzamide HCl, the emetic response to apomorphine is inhibited, while little or no protection is afforded against emesis induced by intragastric copper sulfate.The mechanism of action of trimethobenzamide as determined in animals is obscure, but may involve the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), an area in the medulla oblongata through which emetic impulses are conveyed to the vomiting center; direct impulses to the vomiting center apparently are not similarly inhibited."
408,"As it is a privalate salt, its anti-inflammatory action is concentrated at the site of application. This local effect on diseased areas results in a prompt decrease in inflammation, exudation and itching.Flumethasone pivalate is a moderately potent difluorinated corticosteroid ester with anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive properties. As it is a privalate salt, its anti-inflammatory action is concentrated at the site of application. This complex binds to the nucleus causing a variety of genetic activation and repressions. The antiinflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes."
409,"The sulfonamides are synthetic bacteriostatic antibiotics with a wide spectrum against most gram-positive and many gram-negative organisms. Sulfonamides inhibit multiplication of bacteria by acting as competitive inhibitors of p-aminobenzoic acid in the folic acid metabolism cycle. Bacterial sensitivity is the same for the various sulfonamides, and resistance to one sulfonamide indicates resistance to all. Their antibacterial action is inhibited by pus.Sulfametopyrazine is a competitive inhibitor of the bacterial  enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase. The inhibited reaction is necessary in these organisms for the synthesis of folic acid."
410,"Epinephrine injection is indicated in the emergency treatment of type I allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. It is also used to increase mean arterial blood pressure in adult patients with hypotension associated with septic shock. It is also used for the maintenance of mydriasis during intraocular surgery .Epinephrine, also known as _adrenaline_, is a hormone and neurotransmitter and produced by the adrenal glands that can also be used as a drug due to its various important functions. Though it has long been used in the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions, epinephrine in the auto-injector form (EpiPen) has been available since 1987 in the USA. Epinephrine also alleviates pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema and may be helpful in relieving gastrointestinal and genitourinary symptoms associated with anaphylaxis because of its relaxing effects on the smooth muscle of the stomach, intestine, uterus, and urinary bladder .Epinephrine acts on alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors."
411,"One of the subcutaneous formulations of sumatriptan is also indicated to treat cluster headaches in adults, while the other subcutaneous formulation is not.Sumatriptan is a serotonin receptor agonist commonly used to treat migraines and sometimes cluster headaches. Sumatriptan was granted FDA approval on 28 December 1992.Sumatriptan constricts cranial blood vessels and prevents the release of vasoactive peptides. The dose of sumatriptan varies widely by route of administration and in most cases, no more than 2 doses should be given daily. This agonism leads to constriction of cranial blood vessels and inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory neuropeptides. Sumatriptan decreases carotid arterial blood flow, but increases blood flow velocity in the internal carotid artery and middle cerebral artery."
412,"For the treatment of peptic ulcer, gastric ulcer, and duodenal ulcer.An antimuscarinic agent that inhibits gastric secretion at lower doses than are required to affect gastrointestinal motility, salivary, central nervous system, cardiovascular, ocular, and urinary function. It also potentiates the effect of other antiulcer agents such as cimetidine and ranitidine. It is generally well tolerated by patients.Pirenzepine belongs to a group of medications called antispasmodics/anticholinergics. Pirenzepine is used to treat duodenal or stomach ulcers or intestine problems. It may also be used to prevent nausea, vomiting, and motion sickness.Pirenzepine is a muscarinic receptor antagonist and binds to the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor."
413,"Cefixime is indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections caused by _Escherichia coli_ and _Proteus mirabilis_, otitis media caused by _Haemophilus influenzae_, _Moraxella catarrhalis_, and _Streptococcus pyogenes_, pharyngitis and tonsillitis caused by _Streptococcus pyogenes_,  acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis caused by _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ and _Haemophilus influenzae_, and uncomplicated gonorrhea (cervical/urethral) caused by _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ (penicillinase-and non-penicillinase-producing isolates).Bacteria possess a cell wall comprising a glycopeptide polymer commonly known as peptidoglycan, which is synthesized and remodelled through the action of a family of enzymes known as ""penicillin-binding proteins"" (PBPs). Cephalosporins are beta-lactam antibiotics and can be used to treat gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections which include conditions such as skin infections, resistant bacteria, and meningitis. Also like other cephalosporins, cefixime is stable when in the presence of certain beta-lactamase enzymes, which means certain organisms resistant to penicillins and some cephalosporins due to the presence of beta-lactamases could be susceptible to cefixime. In general, inhibition of one or more essential PBPs results in impaired cell wall homeostasis, loss of cell integrity, and is ultimately bactericidal. Cefixime is a cephalosporin and cephalosporins work by using their beta-lactam rings to inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to the penicillin-binding proteins transpeptidases on bacteria."
414,"Chlorpropamide is an oral antihyperglycemic agent used for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Sulfonylureas increase both basal insulin secretion and meal-stimulated insulin release. Medications in this class differ in their dose, rate of absorption, duration of action, route of elimination and binding site on their target pancreatic β cell receptor. Sulfonylureas also increase peripheral glucose utilization, decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis and may increase the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors. Due to their mechanism of action, sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia and require consistent food intake to decrease this risk."
415,"Aprepitant, an antiemetic, is a substance P/neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonist which, in combination with other antiemetic agents, is indicated for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy. Aprepitant is a selective high-affinity antagonist of human substance P/neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors. Aprepitant is a selective high-affinity antagonist of human substance P/neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors. Aprepitant has little or no affinity for serotonin (5-HT3), dopamine, and corticosteroid receptors, the targets of existing therapies for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CI NV).Aprepitant has been shown in animal models to inhibit emesis induced by cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, such as cisplatin, via central actions. Animal and human Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies with Aprepitant have shown that it crosses the blood brain barrier and occupies brain NK1 receptors."
416,"Galantamine is indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer’s type.Galantamine is a tertiary alkaloid and reversible, competitive inhibitor of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme, which is a widely studied therapeutic target used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Following the discovery of its AChE-inhibiting properties, the cognitive effects of galantamine were studied in a wide variety of psychiatric disorders such as mild cognitive impairment, cognitive impairment in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and autism; however, re-development of the drug for Alzheimer’s disease did not commence until the early 1990s due to difficulties in extraction and synthesis. Galantamine blocks the breakdown of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft, thereby increasing acetylcholine neurotransmission. Galantamine exhibited therapeutic efficacy in studies of vascular dementia and Alzheimer’s disease with cerebrovascular disease. Acetylcholinesterase is secreted by cholinergic neurons to rapidly hydrolyze ACh at the synaptic cleft to release acetate and choline."
417,"Tamoxifen is indicated to treat estrogen receptor positive metastatic breast cancer in adults, as an adjuvant in the treatment of early stage estrogen receptor positive breast cancer in adults, to reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer after surgery and radiation in adult women with ductal carcinoma in situ.Tamoxifen is a non-steroidal antiestrogen used to treat estrogen receptor positive breast cancers as well as prevent the incidence of breast cancer in high risk populations. Tamoxifen may no longer be the preferred treatment for these types of cancers as patients generally have better survival, side effect profiles, and compliance with . It has a long duration of action as the active metabolite N-desmethyltamoxifen has a half life of approximately 2 weeks. It has a narrow therapeutic index as higher doses can lead to breathing difficulty or convulsions. Tamoxifen leads to a decrease in tumor growth factor α and insulin-like growth factor 1, and an increase in sex hormone binding globulin."
418,"For use in the eye to treat certain types of glaucoma and other eye conditions, such as accommodative esotropia.An irreversible cholinesterase inhibitor with actions similar to those of echothiophate. It is a powerful miotic used mainly in the treatment of glaucoma. Its vapor is highly toxic and it is recommended that only solutions in arachis oil be used therapeutically. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 29th ed, p1330)Isoflurophate is used as ocular drops in the treatment of chronic glaucoma. Isoflurophate is an organophosphorus compound that acts as an irreversible cholinesterase inhibitor."
419,"Losartan is indicated to treat hypertension in patients older than 6 years, reduce the risk of stroke in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy (though this benefit may not extend to patients with African heritage), and to treat diabetic nephropathy with elevated serum creatinine and proteinuria in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension. When patients with ACE inhibitor associated coughs are switched to ARBs like losartan, they have an incidence of cough similar to placebo or . Losartan is available as losartan potassium oral tablets as well as a combination tablet of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide. Patients taking losartan should be regularly monitored for hypotension, renal function, and potassium levels.Losartan reversibly and competitively prevents angiotensin II binding to the AT1 receptor in tissues like vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. The active metabolite of losartan is 10-40 times more potent by weight than unmetabolized losartan as an inhibitor of AT1 and is a non-competitive inhibitor."
420,"For the treatment of schizophrenia and generalized anxiety disorder.A phenothiazine antipsychotic used in the management of psychoses, including schizophrenia, and in the control of severely disturbed or agitated behavior. It has little antiemetic activity. Thioridazine has a higher incidence of antimuscarinic effects, but a lower incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms, than chlorpromazine. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p618). Thioridazine was withdrawn worldwide in 2005 due to its association with cardiac arrythmias.Thioridazine is a trifluoro-methyl phenothiazine derivative intended for the management of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders."
421,"Used to treat irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias) and maintain a normal heart rate.An antiarrhythmia agent used primarily for ventricular rhythm disturbances.Moricizine is used to treat irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias) and to maintain a normal heart rate. It acts on the heart muscle to improve the heart's rhythm. Decreases the maxiumum rate of Phase 0 depolarization (V max ), but does not affect action potential amplitude or maximum diastolic potential. Has no effect on sinoatrial (SA) nodal or intra-atrial conduction and only minimal effect on sinus cycle length and sinus node recovery time. It has less effect on the slope of phase 0 and a greater effect on action potential duration and effective refractory period than class IC agents.Moricizine works by inhibiting the rapid inward sodium current across myocardial cell membranes."
422,"Histoplasma capsulatum, Coccidioides immitis, Candida species, Blastomyces dermatitidis, Rhodotorula, Cryptococcus neoformans, Sporothrix schenckii, Mucor mucedo, and Aspergillus fumigatus are all inhibited by concentrations of amphotericin B ranging from 0.03 to 1.0 mcg/mL in vitro. Pseudallescheria boydii and Fusarium sp. The antibiotic is without effect on bacteria, rickettsiae, and viruses.Amphotericin B shows a high order of in vitro activity against many species of fungi. The drug acts by binding to sterols (ergosterol) in the cell membrane of susceptible fungi. Ergosterol, the principal sterol in the fungal cytoplasmic membrane, is the target site of action of amphotericin B and the azoles."
423,"It can also be indicated for induction of general anesthesia, before administration of other anesthetic agents or as a component of intravenous supplementation of nitrous oxide and oxygen for a balanced anesthesia. Finally, midazolam can be indicated as a continous intravenous infusion for sedation of intubated and mechanically ventilated patients as a component of anesthesia or during treatment in a critical care setting. **Oral**    Midazolam syrup is indicated for use in pediatric patients for sedation, anxiolysis and amnesia prior to diagnostic, therapeutic or endoscopic procedures or before induction of anesthesia. **Sedation and memory**    The onset of sedation after intramuscular administration in adults is 15 minutes, with maximal sedation occurring 30-60 minutes after injection. Impairment in a memory test was observed in 90% of the patients.The actions of benzodiazepines such as midazolam are mediated through the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is one of the major inhibitory neurotransmitters in the central nervous system."
424,"As with all antibiotics, tobramycin use should be limited to cases where bacterial infections are known or strongly suspected to be caused by sensitive organisms, and the possible emergence of resistance should be monitored closely.Aminoglycosides, many of which are derived directly from _Streptomyces_ spp., are concentration-dependent bactericidal antibiotics with a broad spectrum of activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. However, tobramycin can also be administered intravenously and topically to treat a variety of infections caused by susceptible bacteria. It has a broad spectrum of activity against Gram-negative bacteria, including _Enterobacteriaceae_, _Escherichia coli_, _Klebsiella pneumoniae_, _Morganella morganii_, _Moraxella lacunata_, _Proteus_ spp., _Haemophilus_ spp., _Acinetobacter_ spp., _Neisseria_ spp., and, importantly, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_. In addition, aminoglycosides are active against some Gram-positive bacteria such as _Staphylococcus_ spp., including methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant strains, _Streptococcus_ spp., and _Mycobacterium_ spp. Mistranslated proteins produced as a result of aminoglycoside binding to the ribosome (see below) integrate into and disrupt the cell membrane, which allows more of the aminoglycoside into the cell (""energy-dependent phase II"")."
425,"Fludrocortisone is indicated as partial replacement therapy for primary or secondary adrenocortical insufficiency in Addison's disease. It is also indicated for the treatment of salt-losing androgenital syndrome.Fludrocortisone is a synthetic mineralocorticoid used in conjunction with  to replace missing endogenous corticosteroids in patients with adrenal insufficiency. As its effects are exerted at the transcriptional level, a single dose of fludrocortisone may work over the course of 1-2 days despite a relatively short plasma half-life. Like other systemic corticosteroids, fludrocortisone may mask signs of infection by depressing the normal immune response - infections occurring during fludrocortisone therapy should be promptly treated with appropriate antimicrobial therapy.The main endogenous mineralocorticoid, aldosterone, is produced in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex - it acts on mineralocorticoid receptors in the kidneys to increase sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, which in turn helps to regulate plasma electrolyte composition and blood pressure. Fludrocortisone binding to mineralocorticoid receptors causes alterations to DNA transcription and translation of proteins that result in an increased density of sodium channels on the apical side of renal tubule cells and an increased density of Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase on the basolateral side."
426,"Other off-label uses of this drug include lupus-associated nephritis and dermatitis in children.Mycophenolate mofetil, also known as MMF or CellCept, is a prodrug of mycophenolic acid, and classified as a reversible inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH). In addition to the above uses, mycophenolate mofetil has also been studied for the treatment of nephritis and other complications of autoimmune diseases. It demonstrates an increased bioavailability, a higher efficacy, and reduced gastrointestinal effects when compared to MPA.Mycophenolate mofetil is a prodrug of mycophenolic acid (MPA). The active form of mycophenolate, MPA, prevents the proliferation of immune cells and the formation of antibodies that cause transplant rejection. IMPDH normally transforms inosine monophosphate (IMP) to xanthine monophosphate (XMP), a metabolite contributing to the production of guanosine triphosphate (GTP)."
427,For treatment of severe infections caused by susceptible bacteria.A cephalorsporin antibiotic that is no longer commonly used.Cephaloglycin is an antibiotic related to cephalosporin but no longer in common use. It is an orally absorbed derivative of cephalosporin C.The bactericidal activity of cephaloglycin results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs).
428,"For short-term and intermittent use in patients with recurring insomnia and poor sleeping habitsA benzodiazepine derivative used mainly as a hypnotic.Flurazepam, a benzodiazepine derivative, is a hypnotic agent which does not appear to decrease dream time as measured by rapid eye movements (REM). Furthermore, it decreases sleep latency and number of awakenings for a consequent increase in total sleep time.Flurazepam binds to an allosteric site on GABA-A receptors. Binding potentiates the action of GABA on GABA-A receptors by opening the chloride channel within the receptor, causing chloride influx and hyperpolarization."
429,"For remission induction in acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (myelogenous, monocytic, erythroid) of adults and for remission induction in acute lymphocytic leukemia of children and adults. Daunorubicin is indicated in combination with  for the treatment of newly-diagnosed therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC) in adults and pediatric patients 1 year and older.A very toxic anthracycline aminoglycoside antineoplastic isolated from Streptomyces peucetius and others, used in treatment of leukemia and other neoplasms.Daunorubicin is an anthracycline antibiotic and antineoplastic agent. It acts by inhibiting cellular reproduction through interference with DNA replication although it may contribute to the induction of cell death by increasing oxidative stress through the generation of reactive oxygen species and free radicals. As an antineoplastic agent, daunorubicin carries significant toxicities including cytopenias, hepatotoxicity, and extravasation reactions. Like other anthracyclines, daunorubicin also exhibits cardiotoxicity in proportion with the cumulative dose received over time.Daunorubicin has antimitotic and cytotoxic activity through a number of proposed mechanisms of action: Daunorubicin forms complexes with DNA by intercalation between base pairs, and it inhibits topoisomerase II activity by stabilizing the DNA-topoisomerase II complex, preventing the religation portion of the ligation-religation reaction that topoisomerase II catalyzes."
430,"Furosemide is indicated for the treatment of edema associated with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver, and renal disease, including the nephrotic syndrome, in adults and pediatric patients. This drug formulation is not indicated for emergency situations or in patients with acute pulmonary edema.Furosemide is a potent loop diuretic that acts on the kidneys to ultimately increase water loss from the body. Furosemide is a potent loop diuretic that works to increase the excretion of Na+ and water by the kidneys by inhibiting their reabsorption from the proximal and distal tubules, as well as the loop of Henle. The duration of action following intravenous administration is approximately 2 hours. Following intramuscular administration, the onset of action is somewhat delayed.Furosemide promotes diuresis by blocking tubular reabsorption of sodium and chloride in the proximal and distal tubules, as well as in the thick ascending loop of Henle."
431,"For use as therapy to abort or prevent vascular headache, e.g., migraine, migraine variants, or so called ""histaminic cephalalgia"".A vasoconstrictor found in ergot of Central Europe. It is an alpha-1 selective adrenergic agonist and is commonly used in the treatment of migraine disorders.Ergotamine is a vasoconstrictor and alpha adrenoreceptor antagonist. The pharmacological properties of ergotamine are extremely complex; some of its actions are unrelated to each other, and even mutually antagonistic. The drug has partial agonist and/or antagonist activity against tryptaminergic, dopaminergic and alpha adrenergic receptors depending upon their site, and it is a highly active uterine stimulant. Ergotamine reduces extracranial blood flow, causes a decline in the amplitude of pulsation in the cranial arteries, and decreases hyperperfusion of the territory of the basilar artery."
432,"Nitrofurantoin is indicated to treat acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections.Nitrofurantoin is a nitrofuran antibiotic used to treat uncomplicated urinary tract infections. Nitrofurantoin is converted by bacterial nitroreductases to electrophilic intermediates which inhibit the citric acid cycle as well as synthesis of DNA, RNA, and protein. This drug is more resistant to the development of bacterial resistance because it acts on many targets at once. Nitrofurantoin is a second line treatment to /. Nitrofurantoin was granted FDA approval on 6 February 1953.Nitrofurantoin interferes with vital processes in bacteria, which leads to their death."
433,"For the treatment of senile dementia, migraines of vascular origin, transient ischemia, platelet hyper-aggregability, and macular degeneration.An ergot derivative that has been used as a cerebral vasodilator and in peripheral vascular disease. It has been suggested to ameliorate cognitive deficits in cerebrovascular disease.Nicergoline is a potent vasodilator (improves brain blood flow). On the cerebral level it prompts a lowering of vascular resistance, an increase in arterial flow and stimulates the use of oxygen and glucose. Nicergoline also improves blood circulation in the lungs and limbs and has been shown to inhibit blood platelet aggregation.Nicergoline acts by inhibiting the postsynaptic alpha(1)-adrenoceptors on vascular smooth muscle. This inhibits the vasoconstrictor effect of circulating and locally released catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine), resulting in peripheral vasodilation."
434,"The resulting increased plasma renin activity and aldosterone circulating levels do not overcome the effects of eplerenone. Eplerenone selectively binds to recombinant human mineralocorticoid receptors relative to its binding to recombinant human glucocorticoid, progesterone and androgen receptors.Eplerenone, an aldosterone receptor antagonist similar to spironolactone, has been shown to produce sustained increases in plasma renin and serum aldosterone, consistent with inhibition of the negative regulatory feedback of aldosterone on renin secretion. The resulting increased plasma renin activity and aldosterone circulating levels do not overcome the effects of eplerenone. Aldosterone synthesis, which occurs primarily in the adrenal gland, is modulated by multiple factors, including angiotensin II and non-RAAS mediators such as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and potassium. Aldosterone binds to mineralocorticoid receptors in both epithelial (e.g., kidney) and nonepithelial (e.g., heart, blood vessels, and brain) tissues and increases blood pressure through induction of sodium reabsorption and possibly other mechanisms."
435,Amprenavir is a protease inhibitor used to treat HIV infection.Amprenavir is a protease inhibitor with activity against Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1). Protease inhibitors block the part of HIV called protease. HIV-1 protease is an enzyme required for the proteolytic cleavage of the viral polyprotein precursors into the individual functional proteins found in infectious HIV-1. Amprenavir binds to the protease active site and inhibits the activity of the enzyme. This inhibition prevents cleavage of the viral polyproteins resulting in the formation of immature non-infectious viral particles.
436,"For treatment of chronic open-angle glaucoma and acute angle-closure glaucomaA carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that is used as a diuretic and in the treatment of glaucoma.Methazolamide is topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Methazolamide is indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension who are insufficiently responsive to beta-blockers. Methazolamide is a sulfonamide derivative; however, it does not have any clinically significant antimicrobial properties. Although methazolamide achieves a high concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid, it is not-considered an effective anticonvulsant. Methazolamide has a weak and transient diuretic effect, therefore use results in an increase in urinary volume, with excretion of sodium, potassium and chloride.Methazolamide is a potent inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase."
437,"Sufentanil is an opioid analgesic that is used as an adjunct in anesthesia, in balanced anesthesia, and as a primary anesthetic agent. Also known as _Dsuvia_, the sublingual form is used for the management of acute pain in adults that is severe to warrant the use of an opioid analgesic in certified medically supervised healthcare settings, including hospitals, surgical centers, and emergency departments . **Effects on the Cardiovascular System**    Sufentanil causes peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Opiate receptors are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as both positive and negative regulators of synaptic neural transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. Opioids close N-type voltage-operated calcium channels (OP2-receptor agonist), also preventing neurotransmitter release ."
438,"For the treatment of HIV infection and chronic hepatitis B (HBV).A reverse transcriptase inhibitor and zalcitabine analog in which a sulfur atom replaces the 3&#39; carbon of the pentose ring. When phosphorylated, lamivudine can form active metabolites that compete for incorporation into viral DNA. Via DNA incorporation, lamivudine metabolites competitively inhibit the activity of the HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme and act as a chain terminator of DNA synthesis. Due to the lack of a 3'-OH group, incorporated nucleoside analogues prevent the formation of a 5' to 3' phosphodiester linkage that is essential for DNA chain elongation. This nucleoside analogue is incorporated into viral DNA by HIV reverse transcriptase and HBV polymerase, resulting in DNA chain termination."
439,"It may also be used to treat pain associated with dysmenorrhea and mild to moderate pain accompanied by inflammation (e.g. bursitis, tendonitis, soft tissue trauma). Flurbiprofen, a propionic acid derivative, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAIA) with antipyretic and analgesic activity. Oral formulations of flurbiprofen may be used for the symptomatic treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and anklylosing spondylitis. The S-enantiomer appears to possess most of the anti-inflammatory, while both enantiomers may possess analgesic activity.Similar to other NSAIAs, the anti-inflammatory effect of flurbiprofen occurs via reversible inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX), the enzyme responsible for the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin G2 (PGG2) and PGG2 to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) in the prostaglandin synthesis pathway. Flurbiprofen is a non-selective COX inhibitor and inhibits the activity of both COX-1 and -2."
440,"Used in the treatment of resistant staphylococci infections.An antibiotic similar to  used in resistant staphylococci infections.Oxacillin is a penicillin beta-lactam antibiotic used in the treatment of bacterial infections caused by susceptible, usually gram-positive, organisms. The name ""penicillin"" can either refer to several variants of penicillin available, or to the group of antibiotics derived from the penicillins. Oxacillin has in vitro activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The bactericidal activity of Oxacillin results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis and is mediated through Oxacillin binding to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). Oxacillin is stable against hydrolysis by a variety of beta-lactamases, including penicillinases, and cephalosporinases and extended spectrum beta-lactamases.By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, Oxacillin inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis."
441,"Apomorphine is indicated to treat acute, intermittent treatment of hypomobility, off episodes associated with advanced Parkinson's disease.Apomorphine is a non-ergoline dopamine D2 agonist indicated to treat hypomobility associated with Parkinson's. It was first synthesized in 1845 and first used in Parkinson's disease in 1884. Apomorphine has also been investigated as an emetic, a sedative, a treatment for alcoholism, and a treatment of other movement disorders. Apomorphine was granted FDA approval on 20 April 2004.Apomorphine is a dopaminergic agonist that may stimulate regions of the brain involved in motor control. Given the incidence of nausea and vomiting in patients taking apomorphine, treatment with  may be recommended prior to or during therapy."
442,"A unique feature of this drug is that it is highly potent and selective in its inhibition of serotonin reuptake and has little effect on other neurotransmitters. The controlled release formulation was designed to decrease the likelihood of nausea that is sometimes associated with paroxetine.Paroxetine treats the symptoms of depression, various anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and the vasomotor symptoms of menopause via the inhibition of serotonin reuptake. This drug has been demonstrated to be a stronger inhibitor of serotonin reuptake than other members of the same drug class, including , , and . The mechanism of action of paroxetine in relieving the vasomotor symptoms of menopause is unknown, according to the Brisdelle prescribing information, but may occur due to its effects on thermoregulation. In rats, paroxetine activates 5-HT1A receptors when it is first administered, inhibiting the stimulation of the  5-HT neurons and subsequent release of serotonin at the synaptic cleft."
443,"When applied via transdermal patch, the combination of norethisterone and estradiol is indicated for the treatment of hypoestrogenism, vulvovaginal atrophy, and moderate-severe vasomotor symptoms.Norethisterone, also known as norethindrone, is a synthetic progestational hormone belonging to the 19-nortestosterone-derived class of progestins. It is further classified as a second-generation progestin, along with  and its derivatives, and is the active form of several other progestins including  and .L9527,L10301,L10304,L10307] First derived in 1951 in Mexico City, norethisterone was originally intended for use as a remedy for irregular menstruation and endometriosis, and was not marketed for use as an oral contraceptive until 1962.Norethisterone is a synthetic oral progestin used for contraception or to treat other hormone-related conditions such as menopausal symptoms and endometriosis. As a synthetic progestin, norethisterone acts similarly to endogenous progesterone but with a much higher potency - it acts at the pelvic level to alter cervical and endometrial function, as well as via the inhibition of pituitary hormones that play a role in follicular maturation and ovulation.L9527]On a molecular level, progestins like norethisterone exert their effects on target cells via binding to progesterone receptors that result in downstream changes to target genes. Contraceptive efficacy is derived mainly from changes to the cervical mucus, wherein norethisterone increases the cell content and viscosity of the mucous to impede sperm transport and migration. The addition of a progestin to a hormone replacement therapy in this population protects against this endometrial hyperplasia and, therefore, lowers the risk associated with the use of hormone replacement therapies."
444,"(From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p1016). Procaine has also been investigated as an oral entry inhibitor in treatment-experienced HIV patients .Procaine is an anesthetic agent indicated for production of local or regional anesthesia, particularly for oral surgery. Procaine (like cocaine) has the advantage of constricting blood vessels which reduces bleeding, unlike other local anesthetics like lidocaine. Procaine is an ester anesthetic. It is metabolized in the plasma by the enzyme pseudocholinesterase through hydrolysis into para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), which is then excreted by the kidneys into the urine.Procaine acts mainly by inhibiting sodium influx through voltage gated sodium channels in the neuronal cell membrane of peripheral nerves."
445,"Lisinopril is indicated for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, hypertension in patients ≥6 years, and as an adjunct therapy for heart failure. A combination product with hydrochlorothiazide is indicated for the treatment of hypertension.Lisinopril is an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) used to treat hypertension, heart failure, and myocardial infarction. Lisinopril is not a prodrug, and functions by inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme as well as the renin angiotensin aldosterone system. Lisinopril is an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), preventing the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Lisinopril also inhibits renin's conversion of angiotensin to angiotensin I."
446,"Indicated for the treatment and management of hypotension.An alpha-adrenergic agonist that causes prolonged peripheral vasoconstriction. Methoxamine is indicated for prevention and treatment of the acute hypotensive state occurring with spinal anesthesia. It is also indicated as adjunctive treatment of hypotension due to hemorrhage, reactions to medications, surgical complications, and shock associated with brain damage due to trauma or tumor. Methoxamine acts on both &alpha;1-adrenergic receptors but appears to have no effect on &beta;-adrenergic receptors. It acts by increasing the force of the heart's pumping action as well as constricting peripheral blood vessels.Methoxamine acts through peripheral vasoconstriction by acting as a pure alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonist, consequently increasing systemic blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic)."
447,"Homatropine is used to treat duodenal or stomach ulcers or intestine problems. Homatropine is used to treat duodenal or stomach ulcers or intestine problems. It can be used together with antacids or other medicine in the treatment of peptic ulcer. It may also be used to prevent nausea, vomiting, and motion sickness.Homatropine is a quaternary ammonium muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. The muscarinic acetylcholine receptor mediates various cellular responses, including inhibition of adenylate cyclase, breakdown of phosphoinositides and modulation of potassium channels through the action of G proteins."
448,"For the treatment of depression and depression accompanied by anxiety, agitation or sleep disturbanceTricyclic antidepressant similar to imipramine, but with more antihistaminic and sedative properties.Trimipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant. It was thought that tricyclic antidepressants work by inhibiting the re-uptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin by nerve cells. However, this response occurs immediately, yet mood does not lift for around two weeks. It is now thought that changes occur in receptor sensitivity in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Presynaptic receptors are affected: a1 and b1 receptors are sensitized, a2 receptors are desensitised (leading to increased noradrenaline production)."
449,"Sublingual nitroglycerin is indicated for the acute relief of an attack or acute prophylaxis of angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease. Transdermal nitroglycerin is indicated for the prevention of angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease. Intravenous nitroglycerin is indicated for the treatment of peri-operative hypertension; for control of congestive heart failure in the setting of acute myocardial infarction; for treatment of angina pectoris in patients who have not responded to sublingual nitroglycerin and beta (β)-blockers; and for induction of intraoperative hypotension. Nitroglycerin is used in a variety of different conditions, including angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease, peri-operative hypertension, congestive heart failure, and chronic anal fissure. cGMP is an endogenous vasodilator of vascular smooth muscle: it causes protein kinase-dependent phosphorylation and activates downstream cascades that promote relaxation and increased blood flow in veins, arteries and cardiac tissue."
450,"Introduced in 1994, rocuronium has rapid onset, and intermediate duration of action. is a γ-cyclodextrin derivative that has been introduced as a novel agent to reverse the action of rocuronium.Neuromuscular blocking agents are drugs that cause skeletal muscle relaxation primarily by causing a decreased response to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) at the myoneural (neuromuscular) junction of skeletal muscle. Neuromuscular agents are classified as depolarizing or nondepolarizing. Rocuronium is a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent with a rapid to intermediate onset depending on dose and intermediate duration. The binding of vecuronium decreases the opportunity for acetylcholine to bind to the nicotinic receptor at the postjunctional membrane of the myoneural junction."
451,"For the treatment of strongyloidiasis (threadworm), cutaneous larva migrans (creeping eruption), visceral larva migrans, and trichinosis.2-Substituted benzimidazole first introduced in 1962. It is active against a variety of nematodes and is the drug of choice for strongyloidiasis. It has CNS side effects and hepatototoxic potential. (From Smith and Reynard, Textbook of Pharmacology, 1992, p919)Thiabendazole is a fungicide and parasiticide. Thiabendazole is also a chelating agent, which means that it is used medicinally to bind metals in cases of metal poisoning, such as lead poisoning, mercury poisoning or antimony poisoning."
452,"It belongs to the meglitinide class of short-acting insulin secretagogues, which act by binding to β cells of the pancreas to stimulate insulin release. Membrane potential is regulated through an inverse relationship between the activity of cell membrane ATP-sensitive potassium channels (ABCC8) and extracellular glucose concentrations. High glucose concentrations cause ATP-sensitive potassium channels to close resulting in membrane depolarization and opening of L-type calcium channels. Nateglinide activity is dependent on the presence functioning β cells and glucose. As such, nateglinide is more effective at reducing postprandial blood glucose levels than fasting blood glucose levels and requires a longer duration of therapy (approximately one month) before decreases in fasting blood glucose are observed."
453,"For use, as an adjunct to general anesthesia, to facilitate endotracheal intubation and to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation.A non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent with short duration of action. Its lack of significant cardiovascular effects and its lack of dependence on good kidney function for elimination provide clinical advantage over alternate non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents.Atracurium is a nondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxant. Atracurium can be used most advantageously if muscle twitch response to peripheral nerve stimulation is monitored to assess degree of muscle relaxation. The duration of neuromuscular block produced by Atracurium is approximately one third to one half the duration of block by d-tubocurarine, metocurine, and pancuronium at initially equipotent doses. As with other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers, the time to onset of paralysis decreases and the duration of maximum effect increases with increasing doses of Atracurium."
454,"Schizophrenia and various mood disorders are thought to be caused by an excess of dopaminergic D2 and serotonergic 5-HT2A activity, resulting in overactivity of central mesolimbic pathways and mesocortical pathways, respectively. Risperidone binds with a very high affinity to 5-HT2A receptors, approximately 10-20 fold greater than the drug's binding affinity to D2 receptors, and carries lesser activity at several off-targets which may responsible for some of its undesirable effects.The primary action of risperidone is to decrease dopaminergic and serotonergic pathway activity in the brain, therefore decreasing symptoms of schizophrenia and mood disorders. Risperidone has a high binding affinity for serotonergic 5-HT2A receptors when compared to dopaminergic D2 receptors in the brain. A reduction in extrapyramidal symptoms with risperidone, when compared to its predecessors, is likely a result of its moderate affinity for dopaminergic D2 receptors.Though its precise mechanism of action is not fully understood, current focus is on the ability of risperidone to inhibit the D2 dopaminergic receptors and 5-HT2A serotonergic receptors in the brain. Rapid dissociation of risperidone from the D2 receptors contributes to decreased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), which occur with permanent and high occupancy blockade of D2 dopaminergic receptors."
455,"Esomeprazole is indicated for the treatment of acid-reflux disorders including healing and maintenance of erosive esophagitis, and symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease, H. pylori eradication, prevention of gastrointestinal bleeds with NSAID use, and for the long-term treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions including Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome. It can also be found in quadruple regimens for the treatment of _H. pylori_ infections along with other antibiotics including , , and , for example. Esomeprazole doses should be slowly lowered, or tapered, before discontinuing to prevent this rebound effect.Esomeprazole is a compound that inhibits gastric acid secretion and is indicated in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), the healing of erosive esophagitis, and <i>H. Esomeprazole belongs to a new class of antisecretory compounds, the substituted benzimidazoles, that do not exhibit anticholinergic or H2 histamine antagonistic properties, but that suppress gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell."
456,"Indicated for the symptomatic treatment of nausea, vomiting, and dizziness associated with motion sickness, and management of vertigo due to various causes, including radiation sickness, Meniere’s syndrome, labyrinthitis and other vestibular disturbances.Meclizine is a histamine H1 antagonist with antiemetic and antivertigo properties. It is used in the symptomatic treatment of motion sickness and control of vertigo associated with vestibular system diseases. Commonly marketed under the brand name Antivert in the U.S., meclizine is available as oral tablets.Meclizine works on the higher centres of the brain to reduce nausea, vomiting, or vertigo. Motion sickness is also regulated by CTZ. Histamine H1 receptors are expressed on the vestibular nuclei and nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) that are activated by motion sickness and stimuli from the pharynx and stomach."
457,"The bactericidal activity of Hetacillin results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis and is mediated through Hetacillin binding to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). Hetacillin has been withdrawn from the market since it has been discovered that it has no therapeutic advantage compared to non-ester derivatives like ampicillin.Hetacillin is a penicillin beta-lactam antibiotic used in the treatment of bacterial infections caused by susceptible, usually gram-positive, organisms. The bactericidal activity of Hetacillin results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis and is mediated through Hetacillin binding to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs).Hetacillin is a semisynthetic penicillin prodrug which itself has no antibacterial activity, but is converted in the body to ampicillin and has actions and uses similar to those of ampicillin. However, this effect is transient, as the hydrolysis product, ampicillin, is readily inactivated by beta lactamase. Once hydrolyzed to ampicillin (and acetone), ampicillin binds to the penicillin binding proteins found in susceptible bacteria."
458,"For the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's Disease)A glutamate antagonist (receptors, glutamate) used as an anticonvulsant (anticonvulsants) and to prolong the survival of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Riluzole extends survival and/or time to tracheostomy. It is also neuroprotective in various in vivo experimental models of neuronal injury involving excitotoxic mechanisms. One hypothesis is that motor neurons, made vulnerable through either genetic predisposition or environmental factors, are injured by glutamate. In some cases of familial ALS the enzyme superoxide dismutase has been found to be defective.The mode of action of riluzole is unknown."
459,"A hydrocortisone enema is indicated for ulcerative colitis, a topical ointment with antibiotics is indicated for corticosteroid responsive dermatoses with infections, and a topical cream with  is indicated to treat cold sores. Oral granules of hydrocortisone are used as a replacement therapy for Adrenocortical Insufficiency (AI) in children under 17 years of age.Hydrocortisone, or cortisol, is a glucocorticoid secreted by the adrenal cortex. Hydrocortisone is used to treat immune, inflammatory, and neoplastic conditions. It was discovered in the 1930s by Edward Kendall and named Compound F, or 17-hydroxycorticosterone. Hydrocortisone was granted FDA approval on 5 August 1952.Hydrocortisone binds to the glucocorticoid receptor leading to downstream effects such as inhibition of phospholipase A2, NF-kappa B, other inflammatory transcription factors, and the promotion of anti-inflammatory genes."
460,"Used for the promotion of diuresis before irreversible renal failure becomes established, the reduction of intracranial pressure, the treatment of cerebral edema, and the promotion of urinary excretion of toxic substances. It is recommended that patients take an orally inhaled short-acting bronchodilator 5-15 minutes prior to every inhaled mannitol dose.Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that is metabolically inert in humans and occurs naturally, as a sugar or sugar alcohol, in fruits and vegetables. Mannitol may also be used for the promotion of diuresis before irreversible renal failure becomes established; the promotion of urinary excretion of toxic substances; as an Antiglaucoma agent; and as a renal function diagnostic aid. On October 30, 2020, mannitol was approved by the FDA as add-on maintenance therapy for the control of pulmonary symptoms associated with cystic fibrosis in adult patients and is currently marketed for this indication under the name BRONCHITOL® by Chiesi USA Inc.Chemically, mannitol is an alcohol and a sugar, or a polyol; it is similar to xylitol or sorbitol. It is also used to treat or prevent medical conditions that are caused by an increase in body fluids/water (e.g., cerebral edema, glaucoma, kidney failure)."
461,"To improve wakefulness in patients with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) associated with narcolepsy.Modafinil is a stimulant drug marketed as a 'wakefulness promoting agent' and is one of the stimulants used in the treatment of narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is caused by dysfunction of a family of wakefulness-promoting and sleep-suppressing peptides, the orexins, whose neurons are activated by modafinil. Modafinil activates glutamatergic circuits while inhibiting GABA.Modafinil is a stimulant drug marketed as a 'wakefulness promoting agent' and is one of the stimulants used in the treatment of narcolepsy. Also, it has been used in the treatment of hypersomnia, a disorder in which patients lack the capacity for meaningful sleep and may require ten or more hours per day. Recent studies have have found that modafinil may help recovering cocaine addicts fight their addiction.The exact mechanism of action is unclear, although in vitro studies have shown it to inhibit the reuptake of dopamine by binding to the dopamine reuptake pump, and lead to an increase in extracellular dopamine."
462,"Used to treat acute iron or aluminum toxicity (an excess of aluminum in the body) in certain patients. It forms iron complexes and is used as a chelating agent, particularly in the mesylate form.Deferoxamine, otherwise known as desferrioxamine or desferal, is a chelating agent used to remove excess iron or aluminum from the body. By removing excess iron or aluminum, the agent reduces the damage done to various organs and tissues, such as the liver.Deferoxamine works in treating iron toxicity by binding trivalent (ferric) iron (for which it has a strong affinity), forming ferrioxamine, a stable complex which is eliminated via the kidneys. 100 mg of deferoxamine is capable of binding approximately 8.5 mg of trivalent (ferric) iron. The formation of aluminoxamine increases blood concentrations of aluminum, resulting in an increased concentration gradient between the blood and dialysate, boosting the removal of aluminum during dialysis."
463,"As an acetylcholine analogue, scopolamine can antagonize muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) in the central nervous system and throughout the body, inducing several therapeutic and adverse effects related to alteration of parasympathetic nervous system and cholinergic signalling. Due to its dose-dependent adverse effects, scopolamine was the first drug to be offered commercially as a transdermal delivery system, Scopoderm TTS®, in 1981. Scopolamine was first approved by the FDA on December 31, 1979, and is currently available as both oral tablets and a transdermal delivery system.Scopolamine is an anticholinergic belladonna alkaloid that, through competitive inhibition of muscarinic receptors, affects parasympathetic nervous system function and acts on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. Patients with gastrointestinal or urinary disorders should be monitored frequently for impairments, and scopolamine should be discontinued if these develop. Due to its gastrointestinal effects, scopolamine can interfere with gastric secretion testing and should be discontinued at least 10 days before performing the test."
464,"For acute and long-term management of signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as for the management of pain.Etodolac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties. The therapeutic effects of etodolac are achieved via inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandins involved in fever, pain, swelling and inflammation. As with other NSAIDs, the S-form has been shown to be active while the R-form is inactive. Both enantiomers are stable and there is no evidence of R- to S- conversion _in vivo_.Similar to other NSAIDs, the anti-inflammatory effects of etodolac result from inhibition of the enzyme cycooxygenase (COX). Etodolac binds to the upper portion of the COX enzyme active site and prevents its substrate, arachidonic acid, from entering the active site."
465,"Used as a local anaesthetic and is often used in dentistry.A local anesthetic that is similar pharmacologically to lidocaine. Currently, it is used most often for infiltration anesthesia in dentistry. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1992, p165)Prilocaine binds to the intracellular surface of sodium channels which blocks the subsequent influx of sodium into the cell. Action potential propagation and never function is, therefore, prevented. This block is reversible and when the drug diffuses away from the cell, sodium channel function is restored and nerve propagation returns.Prilocaine acts on sodium channels on the neuronal cell membrane, limiting the spread of seizure activity and reducing seizure propagation."
466,"For the prevention of itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis.Epinastine is used for the prevention of itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis. It has a multi-action effect that inhibits the allergic response in 3 ways: 1. stabilizes mast cells by preventing mast cell degranulation to control the allergic response, 2. prevents histamine binding to both the H1- and H2-receptors to stop itching and provide lasting protection, and 3. prevents the release of proinflammatory chemical mediators from the blood vessel to halt progression of the allergic response.Epinastine is an antihistamine and an inhibitor of histamine release from the mast cell for topical administration to the eyes. Epinastine is indicated for the prevention of itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis. Epinastine is selective for the histamine H1-receptor and has affinity for the histamine H2 receptor. Epinastine also possesses affinity for the a1-, a2-, and 5-HT2 -receptors."
467,"This monoamine oxidase inhibitor is effective in the treatment of major depression, dysthymic disorder, and atypical depression. Tranylcypromine is a non-hydrazine monoamine oxidase inhibitor with a rapid onset of activity. MAO is an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative deamination of a number of amines, including serotonin, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine. MAO A inhibition is thought to be more relevant to antidepressant activity than MAO B inhibition. Since depression is associated with low levels of monoamines, the inhibition of MAO serves to ease depressive symptoms, as this results in an increase in the concentrations of these amines within the CNS."
468,"For induction and maintenance of general anesthesia.A stable, non-explosive inhalation anesthetic, relatively free from significant side effects.Isoflurane is a general inhalation anesthetic used for induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. It induces muscle relaxation and reduces pains sensitivity by altering tissue excitability. It does so by decreasing the extent of gap junction mediated cell-cell coupling and altering the activity of the channels that underlie the action potential.Isoflurane induces a reduction in junctional conductance by decreasing gap junction channel opening times and increasing gap junction channel closing times. Isoflurane also activates calcium dependent ATPase in the sarcoplasmic reticulum by increasing the fluidity of the lipid membrane. Also appears to bind the D subunit of ATP synthase and NADH dehydogenase."
469,"The mechanism of action is probably very similar to that of phenytoin. The latter drug appears to stabilize rather than to raise the normal seizure threshold, and to prevent the spread of seizure activity rather than to abolish the primary focus of seizure discharges. The mechanism of action is probably very similar to that of phenytoin. The latter drug appears to stabilize rather than to raise the normal seizure threshold, and to prevent the spread of seizure activity rather than to abolish the primary focus of seizure discharges.The mechanism of action is probably very similar to that of phenytoin.

470,"It has been used in dermatology for many years to treat various skin conditions ranging from acne to wrinkles  and activates nuclear receptors to regulate epithelial cell growth and differentiation. Tretinoin is given orally to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia  and topically to treat skin conditions such as acne.Tretinoin is a vitamin A derivative that promotes cell production, proliferation, and differentiation. When used topically, tretinoin regulates epidermal cell turnover and collagen production. In patients with APL, tretinoin promoted the initial maturation of the primitive promyelocytes derived from the leukemic clone, followed by a repopulation of the bone marrow and peripheral blood by normal, polyclonal hematopoietic cells in patients achieving complete remission.The exact mechanism of action of tretinoin in skin conditions and acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) has not been fully elucidated; however, several proposed mechanisms exist. Tretinoin may reduce epidermal melanin and pigmentation by increasing keratinocyte turnover and reducing tyrosinase activity."
471,"Clopidogrel is indicated to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction for patients with non-ST elevated acute coronary syndrome (ACS), patients with ST-elevated myocardial infarction, and in recent MI, stroke, or established peripheral arterial disease,Clopidogrel is a prodrug of a platelet inhibitor used to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. Clopidogrel is indicated to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction for patients with non-ST elevated acute coronary syndrome (ACS), patients with ST-elevated myocardial infarction, and in recent MI, stroke, or established peripheral arterial disease,    It has been shown to be superior to  in reducing cardiovascular outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease and provides additional benefit to patients with acute coronary syndromes already taking aspirin. It has a long duration of action as it is taken once daily and a large therapeutic window as it is given in doses of 75-300mg daily.Clopidogrel is activated via a 2 steps reaction to an active thiol-containing metabolite. This active form is a platelet inhibitor that irreversibly binds to P2Y12 ADP receptors on platelets. This binding prevents ADP binding to P2Y12 receptors, activation of the glycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa complex, and platelet aggregation."
472,May also be used to treat acne. Tetracycline may be an alternative drug for people who are allergic to penicillin.Tetracycline is a broad spectrum polyketide antibiotic produced by the Streptomyces genus of Actinobacteria. It exerts a bacteriostatic effect on bacteria by binding reversible to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit and blocking incoming aminoacyl tRNA from binding to the ribosome acceptor site. It also binds to some extent to the bacterial 50S ribosomal subunit and may alter the cytoplasmic membrane causing intracellular components to leak from bacterial cells. It also binds to some extent to the 50S ribosomal subunit.
473,"For use as single agent therapy for the treatment of the following infections when caused by susceptible isolates of the designated microorganisms: <b>complicated skin and skin structure infections</b> due to <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (b-lactamase and non-b-lactamase producing, methicillin-susceptible isolates only), <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i>, <i>Streptococcus agalactiae</i>, viridans group streptococci, <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> (excluding vancomycin-resistant isolates), <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Proteus mirabilis</i>, <i>Bacteroides fragilis</i> and <i>Peptostreptococcus</i> species; <b>complicated appendicitis and peritonitis</b> caused by viridans group streptococci, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, <i>Bacteroides fragilis</i>, <i>B. thetaiotaomicron</i>, and <i>Peptostreptococcus</i> species. Also for use in the treatment of bacterial meningitis caused by <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>, <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> (b-lactamase and non-b-lactamase-producing isolates), and <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i>.Meropenem is a broad-spectrum carbapenem antibiotic. Meropenem readily penetrates the cell wall of most Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria to reach penicillin-binding- protein (PBP) targets. Its strongest affinities are toward PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>."
474,"The normal adult plasma concentration is 3.5 to 5 mEq per liter. The usual dietary intake of potassium is 50 to 100 mEq per day. If potassium depletion associated with metabolic alkalosis cannot be managed by correcting the fundamental cause of the deficiency, e.g., where the patient requires long-term diuretic therapy, supplemental potassium in the form of high potassium food or potassium chloride may be able to restore normal potassium levels. In rare circumstances (e.g., patients with renal tubular acidosis) potassium depletion may be associated with metabolic acidosis and hyperchloremia. In such patients, potassium replacement should be accomplished with potassium salts other than the chloride, such as potassium bicarbonate, potassium citrate, potassium acetate, or potassium gluconate.Supplemental potassium in the form of high potassium food or potassium chloride may be able to restore normal potassium levels."
475,"It is a derivative of camptothecin that inhibits the action of topoisomerase I. Irinotecan prevents religation of the DNA strand by binding to topoisomerase I-DNA complex, and causes double-strand DNA breakage and cell death. Camptothecins interact specifically with topoisomerase I, an enzyme in the cell nucleus that regulates DNA topology and facilitates nuclear processes such as DNA replication, recombination, and repair. The 3'-DNA terminus of the broken DNA strands bind covalently with the topoisomerase enzyme to form a catalytic intermediate called a cleavable complex. Irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38 bind to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevent religation of these single-strand breaks. Current research suggests that the cytotoxicity of irinotecan is due to double-strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topoisomerase I, DNA, and either Irinotecan or SN-38."
476,"Methimazole is also indicated for the amelioration of hyperthyroid symptoms in preparation for thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine therapy. In Canada, methimazole carries the above indications and is also indicated for the medical treatment of hyperthyroidism regardless of other available treatment options.Methimazole is a thionamide antithyroid agent that inhibits the synthesis of thyroid hormones. It was first introduced as an antithyroid agent in 1949 and is now commonly used in the management of hyperthyroidism, particularly in those for whom more aggressive options such as surgery or radioactive iodine therapy are inappropriate. Traditionally, methimazole has been preferentially used over propylthiouracil due to the risk of fulminant hepatotoxicity carried by the latter, with propylthiouracil being preferred in pregnancy due to a perceived lower risk of teratogenic effects. Methimazole may directly inhibit TPO, but has been shown in vivo to instead act as a competitive substrate for TPO, thus becoming iodinated itself and interfering with the iodination of thyroglobulin."
477,"The inhaler is indicated for the maintenance treatment of asthma as prophylactic therapy. however, is still in use.Mometasone is a medium-potency synthetic corticosteroid with antiinflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. Studies in asthmatic patients have demonstrated that mometasone provides a favorable ratio of topical to systemic activity due to its primary local effect along with the extensive hepatic metabolism and the lack of active metabolites. Though effective for the treatment of asthma, glucocorticoids do not affect asthma symptoms immediately. When glucocorticoids are discontinued, asthma stability may persist for several days or longer."
478,"For use in the treatment of patients with pheochromocytoma, for preoperative preparation of patients for surgery, management of patients when surgery is contraindicated, and chronic treatment of patients with malignant pheochromocytoma.An inhibitor of the enzyme tyrosine 3-monooxygenase, and consequently of the synthesis of catecholamines. It is used to control the symptoms of excessive sympathetic stimulation in patients with pheochromocytoma. The maximum biochemical effect usually occurs within two to three days, and the urinary concentration of catecholamines and their metabolites usually returns to pretreatment levels within three to four days after metyrosine is discontinued. In patients who respond, blood pressure decreases progressively during the first two days of therapy with metyrosine; after withdrawal, blood pressure usually increases gradually to pretreatment values within two to three days.Metyrosine inhibits tyrosine hydroxylase, which catalyzes the first transformation in catecholamine biosynthesis, i.e., the conversion of tyrosine to dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA). This consequently, depletes the levels of the catecholamines dopamine, adrenaline and noradrenaline in the body,usually measured as decreased urinary excretion of catecholamines and their metabolites."
479,"Alprostadil is also used in neonatal patients with congenital heart defects that depend on a patent ductus for survival until corrective or palliative surgery can be performed. This drug causes vasodilation by directly affecting vascular and ductus arteriosus (DA) smooth muscle, preventing or reversing the functional closure of the DA that occurs shortly after birth. This results in increased pulmonary or systemic blood flow in infants.Prostaglandin E1 is produced endogenously to relax vascular smooth muscle and cause vasodilation. Neonates with congenital heart defects treated with alprostadil may experience apnea. In neonatal patients with ductus arteriosus patency, alprostadil relaxes the ductus arteriosus (DA) smooth muscle, preventing or reversing the functional closure of the DA that occurs shortly after birth."
480,"For patients infected with Pediculus humanus capitis (head lice and their ova) of the scalp hair.Malathion is a parasympathomimetic organophosphate compound that is used as an insecticide for the treatment of head lice. Malathion is an irreversible cholinesterase inhibitor and has low human toxicity.Malathion is an organophosphate insecticide commonly used to control mosquitos and other flying insects. The principal toxicological effect of malathion is cholinesterase inhibition, due primarily to malaoxon and to phosphorus thionate impurities.Malathion is a nonsystemic, wide-spectrum organophosphate insecticide. The major metabolites of malathion are mono- and di-carboxylic acid derivatives, and malaoxon is a minor metabolite. However, it is malaoxon that is the strongest cholinesterase inhibitor."
481,"Etoposide inhibits DNA synthesis by forming a complex with topoisomerase II and DNA. Accumulated breaks in DNA prevent entry into the mitotic phase of cell division, and lead to cell death. Etoposide acts primarily in the G2 and S phases of the cell cycle.Etoposide is an antineoplastic agent and an epipodophyllotoxin (a semisynthetic derivative of the podophyllotoxins). The predominant macromolecular effect of etoposide appears to be the induction of DNA strand breaks by an interaction with DNA-topoisomerase II or the formation of free radicals.Etoposide inhibits DNA topoisomerase II, thereby inhibiting DNA re-ligation. The drug is also capable of inhibiting the beta isoform but inhibition of this target is not associated with the anti-tumour activity."
482,"Also used in the management of hypertension either as the sole therapeutic agent or to enhance the effect of other antihypertensive drugs in the more severe forms of hypertension.A thiazide diuretic with actions and uses similar to those of hydrochlorothiazide. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. Thiazides cause vasodilation by activating calcium-activated potassium channels (large conductance) in vascular smooth muscles and inhibiting various carbonic anhydrases in vascular tissue.Hydroflumethiazide is a thiazide diuretic that inhibits water reabsorption in the nephron by inhibiting the sodium-chloride symporter (SLC12A3) in the distal convoluted tubule, which is responsible for 5% of total sodium reabsorption. By blocking the sodium-chloride symporter, Hydroflumethiazide effectively reduces the osmotic gradient and water reabsorption throughout the nephron."
483,"In Canada, oxcarbazepine is indicated for use as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients 6 years of age and older.Oxcarbazepine is an anti-epileptic medication used in the treatment of partial onset seizures that was first approved for use in the United States in 2000. It is a structural derivative of  and exerts a majority of its activity via a pharmacologically active metabolite, MHD, which exists as a racemate in the blood - a pro-drug of the more active (S)-enantiomer is also marketed as a separate anti-epileptic under the name . There have been rare reports of oxcarbazepine resulting in the development of hematologic abnormalities, including agranulocytosis and aplastic anemia. Oxcarbazepine should be discontinued at the first sign of a drug-induced skin reaction.The exact mechanism through which oxcarbazepine and its active metaoblite, MHD, exert their anti-epileptic effects is unclear, but is thought to primarily involve the blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels. Both oxcarbazepine and MHD are thought to inhibit seizure activity by binding to the inactive state of voltage-gated sodium channels, thus prolonging the period in which the receptor is unavailable for action potential propagation."
484,"Propiomazine is largely used for its antihistamininc sleep inducing effects in treating insomnia.Propiomazine, an atypical antipsychotic agent, is used to treat both negative and positive symptoms of schizophrenia, acute mania with bipolar disorder, agitation, and psychotic symptoms in dementia. Future uses may include the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder and severe behavioral disorders in autism. Structurally and pharmacologically similar to clozapine, propiomazine binds to alpha(1), dopamine, histamine H1, muscarinic, and serotonin type 2 (5-HT2) receptors.Although propiomazine is a phenothiazine, it is not used as an antipsychotic. It posesses antihistamine effects and is mostly used as a sedative in treating insomnia.Propiomazine acts as an antagonist of dopamine 1, 2, and 4 receptors, serotonin (5-HT) receptor types 2A and 2C, muscarinic receptors 1 through 5, alpha(1)-receptors, and histamine H1-receptors. Its main use as a sedative is due to its antihistamine effect."
485,"Used to treat respiratory tract, urinary and soft tissue infections.Roxithromycin is a semi-synthethic macrolide antibiotic that is structurally and pharmacologically similar to , , or . It was shown to be more effective against certain Gram-negative bacteria, particularly _Legionella pneumophila_. Roxithromycin exerts its antibacterial action by binding to the bacterial ribosome and interfering with bacterial protein synthesis. It is marketed in Australia as a treatment for respiratory tract, urinary and soft tissue infections.Roxithromycin has the following antibacterial spectrum in vitro: Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae (Pneumococcus), Neisseria meningitides (Meningococcus), Listeria monocytogenes, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Legionella pneumophila, Helicobacter (Campylobacter), Gardnerella vaginalis, Bordetella pertussis, Moraxella catarrhalis (Branhamella Catarrhalis), and Haemophilus ducreyi. Roxithromycin is highly concentrated in polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages, achieving intracellular concentrations greater than those outside the cell."
486,"For the treatment of urinary tract infections caused by susceptible gram-negative microorganisms, including the majority of E. Coli, Enterobacter species,Klebsiella species, and Proteus species.Nalidixic acid is a synthetic 1,8-naphthyridine antimicrobial agent with a limited bacteriocidal spectrum. It is an inhibitor of the A subunit of bacterial DNA gyrase.Nalidixic acid is a quinolone antibacterial agent for oral administration. Nalidixic acid has marked antibacterial activity against gram-negative bacteria including Enterobacter species, Escherichia coli, Morganella Morganii; Proteus Mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and Providencia rettgeri. lidixic acid is bactericidal and is effective over the entire urinary pH range. Conventional chromosomal resistance to nalidixic acid taken in full dosage has been reported to emerge in approximately 2 to 14 percent of patients during treatment; however, bacterial resistance to nalidixic acid has not been shown to be transferable via R factor.Evidence exists for Nalidixic acid that its active metabolite, hydroxynalidixic acid, binds strongly, but reversibly, to DNA, interfering with synthesis of RNA and, consequently, with protein synthesis."
487,"Phenelzine is indicated for the treatment of nonendogenous, neurotic or atypical depression for patients that do not tolerate other forms of therapy. It is important to specify the atypical feature to predict the clinical course of depression and hence generate the best treatment and service. It is a secondary condition to major personality disorder, neuroses and drug use disorders. It is currently approved under prescription by the name of Nardil.The elimination of monoamine oxidase by phenelzine results in the elevation of brain amines such as 2-phenylethylamine which is a metabolite of phenelzine. Phenelzine is shown to elevate brain levels of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and alanine (ALA) as well as to inhibit the activity of the transaminases that normally metabolize these amino acids."
488,"It is also used in combination with other hormones as a component of oral contraceptive pills for preventing pregnancy (most commonly as , a synthetic form of estradiol). Following extensive critique of the WHI results, Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) is now recommended to be used only for a short period (for 3-5 years postmenopause) in low doses, and in women without a history of breast cancer or increased risk of cardiovascular or thromboembolic disease. Estrogen for postmenopausal symptoms should always be given with a progestin component due to estrogen's stimulatory effects on the endometrium; in women with an intact uterus, unopposed estrogen has been shown to promote the growth of the endometrium which can lead to endometrial hyperplasia and possibly cancer over the long-term. Ethinyl estradiol is different from estradiol due to its higher biovailability and increased resistance to metabolism, rendering it more suitable for oral administration.Estradiol acts on the on the estrogen receptors to relieve vasomotor systems (such as hot flashes) and urogenital symptoms (such as vaginal dryness and dyspareunia). Estradiol workings by binding to subtypes of the estrogen receptor: estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and estrogen receptor beta (ERβ)."
489,"For the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, dysmenorrhea, and mild to moderate pain, inflammation, and fever.A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent with analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties. It is an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase.Mefenamic acid, an anthranilic acid derivative, is a member of the fenamate group of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It exhibits anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activities. Similar to other NSAIDs, mefenamic acid inhibits prostaglandin synthetase.Mefenamic acid binds the prostaglandin synthetase receptors COX-1 and COX-2, inhibiting the action of prostaglandin synthetase. As these receptors have a role as a major mediator of inflammation and/or a role for prostanoid signaling in activity-dependent plasticity, the symptoms of pain are temporarily reduced."
490,"An acyclovir topical cream is indicated to treat recurrent herpes labialis in immunocompetent patients 12 years and older. An acyclovir topical ointment is indicated to treat initial genital herpes and limited non-life-threatening mucocutaneous herpes simplex in immunocompromised patients. An acyclovir ophthalmic ointment is indicated to treat acute herpetic keratitis.Acyclovir is a nucleotide analog antiviral used to treat herpes simplex, _Varicella zoster_, herpes zoster, herpes labialis, and acute herpetic keratitis. Acyclovir was granted FDA approval on 29 March 1982.Acyclovir is a nucleoside analog that inhibits the action of viral DNA polymerase and DNA replication of different herpesvirus. Acyclovir has a wide therapeutic window as overdose is rare in otherwise healthy patients.Acyclovir is becomes acyclovir monophosphate due to the action of viral thymidine kinase."
491,"Further, it is first-line therapy for osteoarthritis, acute gouty arthritis, dysmenorrhea, and musculoskeletal inflammation and pain.Naproxen is classified as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory dug (NSAID) and was initially approved for prescription use in 1976 and then for over-the-counter (OTC) use in 1994. Although naproxen is an effective analgesic, it can have unintended deleterious effects in the patient. A study found that use of naproxen induced an increase in blood pressure, although the increase was not as significant as that found with ibuprofen use. Other factors that increase the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding include concurrent use of corticosteroids or anticoagulants, and a history of gastrointestinal ulcers.As with other non-selective NSAIDs, naproxen exerts it's clinical effects by blocking COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes leading to decreased prostaglandin synthesis. The COX-1 enzymes is constitutively active and can be found in normal tissues such as the stomach lining, while the COX-2 enzyme is inducible and produces prostaglandins that mediate pain, fever and inflammation."
492,"ATII increases blood pressure using a number of mechanisms. ADH stimulates further water reabsorption from the kidneys via insertion of aquaporin-2 channels on the apical surface of cells of the DCT and collecting tubules. ACE inhibitors inhibit the rapid conversion of ATI to ATII and antagonize RAAS-induced increases in blood pressure. Inhibiting the deactivation of bradykinin increases bradykinin levels and may sustain the effects of perindoprilat by causing increased vasodilation and decreased blood pressure.There are two isoforms of ACE: the somatic isoform, which exists as a glycoprotein comprised of a single polypeptide chain of 1277; and the testicular isoform, which has a lower molecular mass and is thought to play a role in sperm maturation and binding of sperm to the oviduct epithelium. Perindoprilat, the active metabolite of perindopril, competes with ATI for binding to ACE and inhibits and enzymatic proteolysis of ATI to ATII."
493,"Used for its antineoplastic properties.Nitrogen mustard derivative of uracil. It is a alkylating antineoplastic agent that is used in lymphatic malignancies, and causes mainly gastrointestinal and bone marrow damage.Uracil Mustard selectively inhibits the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The guanine and cytosine content correlates with the degree of Uracil Mustard-induced cross-linking. At high concentrations of the drug, cellular RNA and protein synthesis are also suppressed.After activation, it binds preferentially to the guanine and cytosine moieties of DNA, leading to cross-linking of DNA, thus inhibiting DNA synthesis and function."
494,"In addition, it has also been studied and utilized as an effective management of essential tremor.Primidone is an anticonvulsant used to treat essential tremor as well as grand mal, psychomotor, and focal epileptic seizures. Primidone was developed by J Yule Bogue and H C Carrington in 1949. Primidone was granted FDA Approval on 8 March 1954.Primidone alters sodium and calcium channel transport, reducing the frequency of nerve firing, which may be responsible for its effect on convulsions and essential tremor. Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of status epilepticus with abrupt cessation of primidone.Primidone and its metabolites, phenobarbital and phenylethylmalonamide (PEMA), are active anticonvulsants. Primidone does not directly interact with GABA-A receptors or chloride channels but phenobarbital does."
495,"Sulfasalazine is also indicated as an adjunct therapy in severe ulcerative colitis.For the delayed-release tablet formulation, sulfasalazine is also indicated to treat rheumatoid arthritis in pediatric patients who have responded inadequately to salicylates or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or polyarticular-course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis with the same patients' characteristics.Sulfasalazine is an anti-inflammatory drug structurally related to salicylates and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. It is indicated for managing inflammatory diseases such as ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, sulfasalazine has less teratogenic side effects and faster onset of action compared to conventional DMARD. Although sulfasalazine is only approved by the FDA for ulcerative colitis, research have shown that sulfasalazine is also beneficial for patients with Crohn's disease. Meta-analysis of 19 randomized controlled trials indicated that sulfasalazine is superior to placebo in inducing remission; however, with no supported evidence of mucosal healing, sulfasalazine is not FDA-recommmended for treatment of Crohn's disease.The mode of action of sulfasalazine or its metabolites, 5-aminosalicylic acid and sulfapyridine, is still under investigation but may be related to the anti-inflammatory and/or immunomodulatory properties that have been observed in animal and in vitro models, to its affinity for connective tissue, and/or to the relatively high concentration it reaches in serous fluids, the liver, and intestinal walls, as demonstrated in autoradiographic studies in animals."
496,"Candesartan lowers blood pressure by antagonizing the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS); it competes with angiotensin II for binding to the type-1 angiotensin II receptor (AT1) subtype and prevents the blood pressure increasing effects of angiotensin II. Unlike angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, ARBs do not have the adverse effect of dry cough. It may also be used as an alternative agent for the treatment of heart failure, systolic dysfunction, myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease.Candesartan cilexetil is an ARB prodrug that is rapidly converted to candesartan, its active metabolite, during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Candesartan confers blood pressure lowering effects by antagonizing the hypertensive effects of angiotensin II via the RAAS. Angiotensin II binds to two receptors: type-1 angiotensin II receptor (AT1) and type-2 angiotensin II receptor (AT2)."
497,"For the in-hospital, short-term (up to 48 hours) management of severe hypertension when rapid, but quickly reversible, emergency reduction of blood pressure is clinically indicated, including malignant hypertension with deteriorating end-organ function.A dopamine D1 receptor agonist that is used as an antihypertensive agent. It is an agonist for D1-like dopamine receptors and binds with moderate affinity to &alpha;2-adrenoceptors. It has no significant affinity for D2-like receptors, &alpha;1 and &beta;-adrenoceptors, 5HT1 and 5HT2 receptors, or muscarinic receptors. The R-isomer has approximately 250-fold higher affinity for D1-like receptors than does the S-isomer. Fenoldopam may increase norepinephrine plasma concentration."
498,"Used to relieve anxiety, nervousness, and tension associated with anxiety disorders.Halazepam is a _benzodiazepine_ derivative drug exerting anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative, a muscle relaxing effects. It has been shown to be less toxic than chlordiazepoxide or diazepam. This drug is no longer marketed in the United States, and was withdrawn by _Schering_, its manufacturer, in 2009.Benzodiazepines bind nonspecifically to benzodiazepine receptors BNZ1, which mediates sleep, and BNZ2, which affects affects muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, motor coordination, and memory. As benzodiazepine receptors are thought to be coupled to gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptors, this enhances the effects of GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA receptor. Binding of GABA to the site opens the chloride channel, resulting in a hyperpolarized cell membrane that prevents further excitation of the cell."
499,"For the management of postoperative pain and the maintenance of general anesthesia.A short-acting opioid anesthetic and analgesic derivative of fentanyl. Alfentanil is effective as an anesthetic during surgery, for supplementation of analgesia during surgical procedures, and as an analgesic for critically ill patients.Alfentanil is a synthetic opioid analgesic. Alfentanil interacts predominately with the opioid mu-receptor. These mu-binding sites are discretely distributed in the human brain, spinal cord, and other tissues. In clinical settings, alfentanil exerts its principal pharmacologic effects on the central nervous system."
500,"Polymyxins are cationic polypeptides that disrupt the bacterial cell membrane through a detergentlike mechanism. With the development of less toxic agents, such as extended-spectrum penicillins and cephalosporins, parenteral polymyxin use was largely abandoned, except for the treatment of multidrug-resistant pulmonary infections in patients with cystic fibrosis. More recently, however, the emergence of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, and the lack of new antimicrobial agents have led to the revived use of the polymyxins.Colistin is a surface active agent which penetrates into and disrupts the bacterial cell membrane. Colistin is polycationic and has both hydrophobic and lipophilic moieties. It interacts with the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane, changing its permeability."
501,"For the treatment of depressionMinaprine is a psychotropic drug which has proved to be effective in the treatment of various depressive states. Like most antidepressants minaprine antagonizes behavioral despair. Minaprine  is an amino-phenylpyridazine antidepressant reported to be relatively free of cardiotoxicity, drowsiness, and weight gain.Minaprine is an amino-phenylpyridazine antidepressant reported to be relatively free of cardiotoxicity, drowsiness, and weight gain. It also binds to the serotonin reuptake pump. Therefore, minaprine blocks the reuptake of both dopamine and serotonin."
502,"Although originally developed to treat intermittent claudication, a form of exertion-induced leg pain common in patients with peripheral arterial disease, PTX has been investigated for its possible use in diverse conditions, including osteoradionecrosis, diabetic kidney disease, and generally any condition associated with fibrosis. A branded product, PENTOXIL, marketed by Upsher-Smith Laboratories, and generic forms marketed by Valeant Pharmaceuticals and APOTEX have been available since the late 1990s.Pentoxifylline, a synthetic dimethylxanthine derivative structurally related to  and , exhibits hemorheological, anti-oxidative, and anti-inflammatory properties and is traditionally indicated in the treatment of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The classical interpretation of PTX's broad effects is due to its ability to act, _in vitro_, as a non-specific cyclic-3',5'-phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor at millimolar concentrations; specifically, it has been proposed that inhibition of PDE type III and IV isozymes leads to elevated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which mediate diverse downstream effects. Elevated cAMP levels have numerous downstream effects. cAMP-mediated activation of protein kinase A (PKA) suppresses nuclear translocation of NF-κB, which suppresses transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF-α), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and IL-6 as well as TNF-induced molecules such as adhesion molecules (ICAM1 and VCAM1) and the C-reactive protein (CRP)."
503,"Used as a local (ophthalmic) anesthetic.Proparacaine is a topical anesthetic drug of the amino ester group. It is found in ophthalmic solutions at a concentration of 0.5% as the hydrochloride salt.Proparacaine stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses thereby effecting local anesthetic action. More specifically, proparacaine appears to bind or antagonize the function of voltage gated sodium channels.The exact mechanism whereby proparacaine and other local anesthetics influence the permeability of the cell membrane is unknown; however, several studies indicate that local anesthetics may limit sodium ion permeability through the lipid layer of the nerve cell membrane. Proparacaine may alter epithelial sodium channels through interaction with channel protein residues. This limitation prevents the fundamental change necessary for the generation of the action potential."
504,"reduced sodium intake) along with pharmacotherapy - it should be noted that treatment with several antihypertensive agents may be required in order to achieve blood pressure targets. Indapamide is characterized by both a methylindoline and a sulfamoyl chlorobenzamide functional group, with the former being largely responsible for the molecule’s lipid solubility.Classified as a sulfonamide diuretic, indapamide is an effective antihypertensive agent and by extension, has shown efficacy in the prevention of target organ damage. Severe and clinically significant electrolyte disturbances may occur with indapamide use - for example, hypokalemia resulting from renal potassium loss may lead to QTc prolongation. As a result, sodium and water are retained in the lumen of the nephron for urinary excretion. Interestingly, it is likely that thiazide-like diuretics such as indapamide have additional blood pressure lowering mechanisms that are unrelated to diuresis."
505,"Oral tropicamide has been investigated as a potential drug to relieve sialorrhea in patients with Parkinson's Disease.Tropicamide is an anticholinergic drug and that works by non‐selectively blocking muscarinic receptors to cause mydriasis and cycloplegia. The cycloplegic effect occurs within 20 to minutes following administration, with a duration of action of four to 10 hours. In response to light or binding of acetylcholine, M3 receptor signalling leads to contraction of the sphincter pupillae and pupil constriction. The eye is also innervated by parasympathetic nerves: ciliary ganglion neurons project to the ciliary body and the sphincter pupillae muscle of the iris to control ocular accommodation and pupil constriction. By binding to muscarinic receptors, tropicamide relaxes the pupillary sphincter muscle and causes pupil dilation."
506,"It has been used in the treatment of arteriosclerotic, idiopathic, and postencephalitic parkinsonism. It has, therefore, some antisecretory, antispasmodic and mydriatic effects. In addition, biperiden possesses nicotinolytic activity. The parenteral form of biperiden is an effective and reliable agent for the treatment of acute episodes of extrapyramidal disturbances sometimes seen during treatment with neuroleptic agents. The mechanism of action of centrally active anticholinergic drugs such as biperiden is considered to relate to competitive antagonism of acetylcholine at cholinergic receptors in the corpus striatum, which then restores the balance."
507,"The addition of ribavirin in Technivie therapy indicated for treating HCV genotype 1a and 4 infections is recommended in patients with or without cirrhosis. Producing a broad-spectrum activity against several RNA and DNA viruses, Ribavirin is a synthetic guanosine nucleoside and antiviral agent that interferes with the synthesis of viral mRNA. It is primarily indicated for use in treating hepatitis C and viral hemorrhagic fevers. Ribavirin is a prodrug that is metabolized into nucleoside analogs that blocks viral RNA synthesis and viral mRNA capping. Addition of weight-based ribavirin to Technivie therapy increased sustained virologic response after 12 weeks of daily therapy (SVR12) from 90% to 97% in patients with HCV genotype 1a and 90.9% to 100% in HCV genotype 4 patients ."
508,"For the treatment of backache and ankylosing spondylitisA drug that has anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic activities. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1994, p1822)Phenylbutazone is a synthetic, pyrazolone derivative. It is a nonhormonal anti-inflammatory, antipyretic compound useful in the management of inflammatory conditions. The apparent analgesic effect is probably related mainly to the compound's anti-inflammatory properties and arise from its ability to reduce production of prostaglandin H and prostacyclin. Prostaglandins act on a variety of cells such as vascular smooth muscle cells causing constriction or dilation, on platelets causing aggregation or disaggregation and on spinal neurons causing pain."
509,"These injections are also used with a neuroleptic for premedication, induction, and as an adjunct to maintenance of anesthesia. Finally, fentanyl intravenous or intramuscular injections are used with oxygen for anesthesia in high risk patients. In 2017, 47600 overdose deaths in the United States involved some opioid (over 2/3 of all overdose deaths). It has a duration of action of several hours and a wider therapeutic index as patients develop tolerance to opioids. Activation of opioid receptors causes GTP to be exchanged for GDP on the G-proteins which in turn down regulates adenylate cyclase, reducing concentrations of cAMP."
510,"Meloxicam is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of arthritis and osteoarthritis. In addition to the above, meloxicam has also been studied in the treatment of neuropathic pain.Meloxicam is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve various types of pain, including pain caused by musculoskeletal conditions, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Meloxicam is available in oral, transdermal, and intravenous formulations. It is a preferential COX-2 inhibitor, purportedly reducing the risk of adverse gastrointestinal tract effects, however, this is a topic of controversy.Meloxicam is an anti-inflammatory, analgesic analgesic with antipyretic effects in fever. A note on gastrointestinal effects    As meloxicam preferentially inhibits COX-2, it is thought to cause less gastrointestinal irritation compared to other NSAIDS."
511,"Orciprenaline (also known as metaproterenol), a synthetic amine, is structurally and pharmacologically similar to isoproterenol. Orciprenaline is used exclusively as a bronchodilator. Increased cAMP levels lead to relaxation of bronchial smooth muscles and inhibition of the release of inalammatory mediators from mast cells that are involved in promoting immediate hypersensitivity .Orciprenaline stimulates the β2-adrenergic receptor expressed in the lungs, uterus, and vasculature supplying skeletal muscles by acting as a moderately selective agonist. It exerts minimal or no effect on alpha-adrenergic receptors. Intracellularly, the actions of orciprenaline are mediated by cAMP, the production of which is augmented by beta stimulation."
512,"For the treatment of bacterial infection of respiratory tract, urinary tract, GI, CNS and immuno compromised patients.Rosoxacin is a quinolone derivative antibiotic for the treatment of bacterial infection of respiratory tract, urinary tract, GI, CNS and immuno compromised patients. Rosoxacin is known to be effective against penicillin resistant strains and is a single dose orally administered drug, which avoids all complications of parenteral administration seen with penicillin, especially anaphylactic shock.Rosoxacin is a nonfluorinated quinolone antibiotic. Its mode of action depends on blocking of bacterial DNA replication by binding itself to an enzyme called DNA gyrase, which allows the untwisting required to replicate one DNA double helix into two. Rosoxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.Rosoxacin binds to and inhibits the enzymes topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV, which are required for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination."
513,"Used for induction and/or maintenance of anaesthesia and for management of refractory status epilepticus. Propofol is an intravenous anaesthetic agent used for induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia. IV administration of propfol is used to induce unconsciousness after which anaesthesia may be maintained using a combination of medications. Recovery from propofol-induced anaesthesia is generally rapid and associated with less frequent side effects (e.g. drowsiness, nausea, vomiting) than with thiopental, methohexital, and etomidate. Propofol may be used prior to diagnostic procedures requiring anaesthesia, in the management of refractory status epilepticus, and for induction and/or maintenance of anaesthesia prior to and during surgeries.Propofol is a sedative-hypnotic agent for use in the induction and maintenance of anesthesia or sedation."
514,"For adjunctive treatment of: edema due to congestive heart failure; drug-induced edema; centrencephalic epilepsies; chronic simple (open-angle) glaucomaOne of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitors that is sometimes effective against absence seizures. It is sometimes useful also as an adjunct in the treatment of tonic-clonic, myoclonic, and atonic seizures, particularly in women whose seizures occur or are exacerbated at specific times in the menstrual cycle. However, its usefulness is transient often because of rapid development of tolerance. Its antiepileptic effect may be due to its inhibitory effect on brain carbonic anhydrase, which leads to an increased transneuronal chloride gradient, increased chloride current, and increased inhibition. (From Smith and Reynard, Textbook of Pharmacology, 1991, p337)Acetazolamide is a potent carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, effective in the control of fluid secretion, in the treatment of certain convulsive disorders and in the promotion of diuresis in instances of abnormal fluid retention."
515,"In contrast to other PDE5 inhibitors like , tadalafil has greater selectivity for PDE5 and a longer half-life which has made it a more suitable option for chronic once-daily dosing in the treatment of PAH.Tadalafil exerts a therapeutic effect in ED by increasing sexual stimulation-dependant smooth muscle relaxation in the penis, allowing the corpus cavernosum to fill with blood to produce an erection. Smooth muscle relaxation in the pulmonary vasculature helps to produce vasodilation in PAH which reduces blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. In BPH, tadalafil may contribute to decreased smooth muscle cell proliferation which may reduce the size of the prostate and relieve the anatomical obstruction which produces urinary symptoms of BPH. Inhibition of PDE5 by tadalafil increases signaling via the PKG cascade which supports penile smooth muscle relaxation during sexual arousal by decreasing Ca2+ entry into smooth muscle cells. It may instead exert its effect through a mix of increased oxygenation and decreased inflammation, which decreases tissue remodeling, and inhibition of cell proliferation through the cGMP cascade."
516,"For the treatment and management of chronic alcoholismA carbamate derivative used as an alcohol deterrent. When alcohol is ingested after administration of disulfiram, blood acetaldehyde concentrations are increased, followed by flushing, systemic vasodilation, respiratory difficulties, nausea, hypotension, and other symptoms (acetaldehyde syndrome). It acts by inhibiting aldehyde dehydrogenase.Disulfiram produces a sensitivity to alcohol which results in a highly unpleasant reaction when the patient under treatment ingests even small amounts of alcohol. Accumulation of acetaldehyde in the blood produces a complex of highly unpleasant symptoms referred to hereinafter as the disulfiram-alcohol reaction. Prolonged administration of disulfiram does not produce tolerance; the longer a patient remains on therapy, the more exquisitely sensitive he becomes to alcohol.Disulfiram blocks the oxidation of alcohol at the acetaldehyde stage during alcohol metabolism following disulfiram intake causing an accumulation of acetaldehyde in the blood producing highly unpleasant symptoms."
517,"Although etynodiol or ethynodiol are sometimes used as a synonym for ethynodiol diacetate, what is usually being referred to is actually ethynodiol diacetate and not ethynodiol (which is a separate drug that has never been marketed, see ).Ethynodiol Diacetate is used as a female contraceptive. Ethynodiol Diacetate is a progestin or a synthetic form of the naturally occurring female sex hormone, progesterone. If pregnancy occurs, progesterone levels in the body remain high, maintaining the womb lining. If pregnancy does not occur, progesterone levels in the body fall, resulting in a menstrual period. This prevents the release of eggs from the ovaries.Binds to the progesterone and estrogen receptors."
518,"Used in the management of symptoms of asthma. Also used in the treatment of peripheral vascular diseases and in the management of cerebrovascular insufficiency, sickle cell disease, and diabetic neuropathy.Enprofylline is a derivative of theophylline which shares bronchodilator properties. It antagonizes erythrocyte phosphodiesterase, increasing cAMP activity.Enprofylline inhibits erythrocyte phosphodiesterase, resulting in an increase in erythrocyte cAMP activity. Subsequently, the erythrocyte membrane becomes more resistant to deformity. Along with erythrocyte activity, enprofylline also decreases blood viscosity by reducing plasma fibrinogen concentrations and increasing fibrinolytic activity."
519,"For the treatment of initial and recurrent urinary tract infections in adults caused by the following susceptible microorganisms: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiella species (including K. pneumoniae), and Enterobacter species.Synthetic antimicrobial related to oxolinic acid and nalidixic acid and used in urinary tract infections.Cinoxacin is a synthetic antibacterial agent with in vitro activity against many gram-negative aerobic bacteria, particularly strains of the Enterobacteriaceae family. Cinoxacin inhibits bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis, is bactericidal, and is active over the entire urinary pH range. Cross resistance with nalidixic acid has been demonstrated.Evidence exists that cinoxacin binds strongly, but reversibly, to DNA, interfering with synthesis of RNA and, consequently, with protein synthesis. It appears to also inhibit DNA gyrase. This enzyme is necessary for proper replicated DNA separation."
520,"In terms of chemical structure, fosfomycin is a phosphoenolpyruvate analog and contains a phosphonic group and an epoxide ring. Due to its ease of administration as a single 3-gram oral dose and desirable safety profile, fosfomycin has largely become a first-line therapeutic option for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) in females. As such there is great interest in exploring the usefulness of fosfomycin for indications beyond the treatment of UTIs.Although used primarily to treat urinary tract infections, fosfomycin has been shown to act synergistically with other antibiotics against clinically relevant bacteria. Fosfomycin also has important effects on cell adhesion. For example, the adhesion of bacterial cells to urinary epithelial cells is reduced in the presence of fosfomycin."
521,"Furthermore, diazepam is a useful adjunct for the relief of skeletal muscle spasm due to reflex spasm to local pathologies, such as inflammation of the muscle and joints or secondary to trauma; spasticity caused by upper motor neuron disorders, such as cerebral palsy and paraplegia; athetosis and the rare ""stiff man syndrome"". In the same UK label information, diazepam is indicated in children for: (1) control of tension and irritability in cerebral spasticity in selected cases, (2) as an adjunct to the control of muscle spasm in tetanus, and for (3) oral premedication. It is used in the treatment of severe anxiety disorders, as a hypnotic in the short-term management of insomnia, as a sedative and premedicant, as an anticonvulsant, and in the management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. This current development is subsequently an important addition to the rescue therapy tool chest for patients with epilepsy .Diazepam is a benzodiazepine that exerts anxiolytic, sedative, muscle- relaxant, anticonvulsant and amnestic effects . This binding increases the inhibitory effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) ."
522,"For the treatment of anxiety disorders, depressive symptoms secondary to anxiety and agitation.A phenothiazine with actions similar to chlorpromazine. It is used as an antipsychotic and an antiemetic.Trifluoperazine is a trifluoro-methyl phenothiazine derivative intended for the management of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Trifluoperazine has not been shown effective in the management of behaviorial complications in patients with mental retardation.Trifluoperazine blocks postsynaptic mesolimbic dopaminergic D1 and D2 receptors in the brain; depresses the release of hypothalamic and hypophyseal hormones and is believed to depress the reticular activating system thus affecting basal metabolism, body temperature, wakefulness, vasomotor tone, and emesis."
523,"For the treatment of epilepsy.Phensuximide is a member of the succinimide class with anticonvulsant properties. It suppresses the paroxysmal three cycle per second spike and wave EEG pattern associated with lapses of consciousness in petit mal seizures. The frequency of attacks is reduced by depression of nerve transmission in the motor cortex.Phensuximide suppresses the paroxysmal three cycle per second spike and wave EEG pattern associated with lapses of consciousness in absence (petit mal) seizures. The frequency of attacks is reduced by depression of nerve transmission in the motor cortex.Phensuximide's mechanism of action not understood, but may act in inhibitory neuronal systems that are important in the generation of the three per second rhythm. It's effects may be related to its ability to inhibit depolarization-induced accumulation of cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP in brain tissue."
524,"For the treatment of certain infections caused by bacteria such as pneumonia and ear, lung, skin, throat, and urinary tract infections.Semisynthetic, broad-spectrum antibiotic derivative of cephalexin.Cefaclor is a second generation cephalosporin antibiotic with a spectrum resembling first-generation cephalosporins. In vitro tests demonstrate that the bactericidal action of the cephalosporins results from inhibition of cell-wall synthesis. As indicated by _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ clinical studies, cefaclor was shown to be effective against most strains of Gram positive aerobes - Staphylococci (including coagulase-positive, coagulase-negative, and penicillinase-producing strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes (group A &szlig;-hemolytic streptococci), as well as Gram-negative aerobes - Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae (including &szlig;-lactamase-producing ampicillin-resistant strains), Klebsiella sp, and Proteus mirabilis.Cefaclor, like the penicillins, is a beta-lactam antibiotic. By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, it inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins."
525,"Also indicated to control hyperglycemia secondary to hypercortisolism in adult patients with endogenous Cushing's syndrome who have type 2 diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance and are not candidates for surgery or have had unsuccessful surgery.Mifepristone is a progestational and glucocorticoid hormone antagonist. Its inhibition of progesterone induces bleeding during the luteal phase and in early pregnancy by releasing endogenous prostaglandins from the endometrium or decidua. Currently under investigation for use in psychotic depression (phase 3 trials).Mifepristone is a synthetic steroid with antiprogestational effects indicated for the medical termination of intrauterine pregnancy through 49 days' pregnancy. The termination of pregnancy results. In the treatment of Cushing's syndrome, Mifepristone blocks the binding of cortisol to its receptor."
526,"For the treatment of the symptoms of the common cold and allergic rhinitis, such as runny nose, itchy eyes, watery eyes, and sneezing.Histamine H1 antagonist used in treatment of allergies, rhinitis, and urticaria.Brompheniramine is an antihistaminergic medication of the propylamine class. It is a first-generation antihistamine. In allergic reactions an allergen interacts with and cross-links surface IgE antibodies on mast cells and basophils. Once the mast cell-antibody-antigen complex is formed, a complex series of events occurs that eventually leads to cell-degranulation and the release of histamine (and other chemical mediators) from the mast cell or basophil. Once released, histamine can react with local or widespread tissues through histamine receptors."
527,"However, loperamide is associated with a risk for experiencing a range of adverse effects, often life-threatening, if taking for non-therapeutic reasons or at doses higher than the recommended dose.Loperamide is an anti-diarrheal agent that provides symptomatic relief of diarrhea. It decreases peristalsis and fluid secretion in the gastrointestinal tract, delays colonic transit time, and increases the absorption of fluids and electrolytes from the gastrointestinal tract. It also increases the tone of the anal sphincter, thereby reducing incontinence and urgency. While loperamide is a potent mu-opioid receptor agonist, it does not mediate significant analgesic activity at therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses. Loperamide stimulates the intestinal absorption of water and electrolytes by inhibiting calmodulin."
528,"Indicated for the treatment of epilepsy.Progabide is an analog and prodrug of gamma-aminobutyric acid. It is commonly used in the treatment of epilepsy. It has agonistic activity for both the GABAA and GABAB receptors. In clinical trials, progabide has been investigated for Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, clinical depression and anxiety disorder; its therapeutic effectiveness in these conditions is not fully elucidated.Progabide, a fatty acid derivative, is a GABA receptor agonist used to treat the symptoms of epilepsy.Progabide binds to both GABAA and GABAB receptors located on the terminals of primary afferent fibers. Activation of the GABAB receptors retards the influx of calcium ions into the terminals, thereby reducing the evoked release of excitatory amino acids and possibly other transmitters."
529,"For short-term topical treatment of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of moderate to severe corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses of the scalp.Clocortolone is a medium potency corticosteroid that is often used as a topical cream for the relief of inflammatory oand pruritic (itching) arising from steroid-responsive dermatoses of the scalp.Like other topical corticosteroids, clocortolone has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Clocortolone is a moderate potency topical corticosteroid that should not be used with occlusive dressings. It is recommended that treatment should be limited to 2 consecutive weeks and therapy should be discontinued when adequate results have been achieved.The precise mechanism of the antiinflammatory activity of topical steroids in the treatment of steroid-responsive dermatoses, in general, is uncertain. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins."
530,"For use as an adjunct to diet to lower the blood glucose in patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (Type II) whose hyperglycemia cannot be satisfactorily controlled by diet alone.A sulphonylurea hypoglycemic agent with actions and uses similar to those of chlorpropamide.Tolazamide is an oral blood glucose lowering drug of the sulfonylurea class. The mechanism by which tolazamide lowers blood glucose during long-term administration has not been clearly established. Extrapancreatic effects may be involved in the mechanism of action of oral sulfonylurea hypoglycemic drugs. Some patients who are initially responsive to oral hypoglycemic drugs, including tolazamide, may become unresponsive or poorly responsive over time. Alternatively, tolazamide may be effective in some patients who have become unresponsive to one or more other sulfonylurea drugs."
531,"Indicated when parenteral therapy is necessary for inotropic support in the short-term treatment of patients with cardiac decompensation due to depressed contractility resulting either from organic heart disease or from cardiac surgical procedures.A beta-1 agonist catecholamine that has cardiac stimulant action without evoking vasoconstriction or tachycardia. It is proposed as a cardiotonic after myocardial infarction or open heart surgery.Dobutamine is a direct-acting inotropic agent whose primary activity results from stimulation of the beta-adrenoceptors of the heart while producing comparatively mild chronotropic, hypertensive, arrhythmogenic, and vasodilative effects. Dobutamine acts primarily on beta-1 adrenergic receptors, with negligible effects on beta-2 or alpha receptors. It does not cause the release of endogenous norepinephrine, as does dopamine. Dobutamine directly stimulates beta-1 receptors of the heart to increase myocardial contractility and stroke volume, resulting in increased cardiac output."
532,"It may also be used in the management of alcohol withdrawal symptoms.Oxazepam is an intermediate-acting, 3-hydroxybenzodiazepine used in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal and anxiety disorders. Oxazepam, like related 3-hydroxybenzodiazepine , is considered less susceptible to pharmacokinetic variability based on patient-specific factors (e.g. age, liver disease) - this feature is advantageous as compared to other benzodiazepines, and is likely owing in part to oxazepam's relatively simple metabolism. Compared to other benzodiazepines, it has relatively low potency and a moderate duration of action. Oxazepam should be administered with caution to patients for whom a drop in blood pressure may lead to cardiac complications as, in rare cases, it may cause hypotension.Like other benzodiazepines, oxazepam exerts its anxiolytic effects by potentiating the effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on GABA(A) receptors, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the mammalian brain. GABA(A) receptors are a component of GABA-gated ionotropic chloride channels that produce inhibitory postsynaptic potentials - following activation by GABA, the channel undergoes a conformational change that allows the passage of chloride ions through the channel."
533,"Donepezil, administered orally or via transdermal delivery system, is indicated for the treatment of dementia of the Alzheimer's type.L7937]     Off-label uses include the management of vascular dementia, Parkinson's Disease-associated dementia, and Lewy body dementia, amongst others.In 2016, the global burden of dementia was estimated to be 43.8 million, demonstrating a significant increase from a global prevalence of 20.2 million in 1990. A donepezil transdermal delivery system, Adlarity, was approved by the FDA in March 2022 for the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia. Though it does not alter the progression of Alzheimer's disease, donepezil is effective in managing the symptoms of its associated dementia.By inhibiting the acetylcholinesterase enzyme, donepezil improves the cognitive and behavioral signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease, which may include apathy, aggression, confusion, and psychosis. The commonly accepted cholinergic hypothesis proposes that a portion of the cognitive and behavioral decline associated with Alzheimer's are the result of decreased cholinergic transmission in the central nervous system. Donepezil selectively and reversibly inhibits the acetylcholinesterase enzyme, which normally breaks down acetylcholine."
534,"For the relief of moderate to severe pain.A narcotic used as a pain medication. It appears to be an agonist at kappa opioid receptors and an antagonist or partial agonist at mu opioid receptors. Nalbuphine by itself has potent opioid antagonist activity at doses equal to or lower than its analgesic dose. Nalbuphine should be used with caution in patients who have been receiving mu opioid analgesics on a regular basis.The exact mechanism of action is unknown, but is believed to interact with an opiate receptor site in the CNS (probably in or associated with the limbic system). It is also a partial mu antagonist analgesic, with some binding to the delta receptor and minimal agonist activity at the sigma receptor."
535,"Cordran is primarily effective because of its anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive actions. Flurandrenolide, which is slowly released from the Cordran tape, binds to the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor. After binding the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Like other glucocorticoid agents Fluocinolone acetonide acts as a physiological antagonist to insulin by decreasing glycogenesis (formation of glycogen)."

537,"For the relief of anxiety, tension, and apprehension, also used as an anticonvulsant for the treatment of epilepsy.A barbiturate that is metabolized to phenobarbital. It has been used for similar purposes, especially in epilepsy, but there is no evidence mephobarbital offers any advantage over phenobarbital.Methylphenobarbital, a barbiturate, is used in combination with acetaminophen or aspirin and caffeine for its sedative and relaxant effects in the treatment of tension headaches, migraines, and pain. Barbiturates act as nonselective depressants of the central nervous system (CNS), capable of producing all levels of CNS mood alteration from excitation to mild sedation, hypnosis, and deep coma. In sufficiently high therapeutic doses, barbiturates induce anesthesia.Methylphenobarbital binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl- ionopore at the GABAA receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl- ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged."
538,"For use in the management of the manifestations of psychotic disorders and for the control of severe nausea and vomiting in adults.An antipsychotic phenothiazine derivative with actions and uses similar to those of chlorpromazine.Perphenazine is a piperazinyl phenothiazine, acts on the central nervous system, and has a greater behavioral potency than other phenothiazine derivatives whose side chains do not contain a piperazine moiety. It is a member of a class of drugs called phenothiazines, which are dopamine D1/D2 receptor antagonists. Perphenazine is 10 to 15 times as potent as chlorpromazine; that means perphenazine is a highly potent antipsychotic. In equivalent doses it has approximately the same frequency and severity of early and late extrapypramidal side-effects compared to Haloperidol.Binds to the dopamine D1 and dopamine D2 receptors and inhibits their activity. The mechanism of the anti-emetic effect is due predominantly to blockage of the dopamine D2 neurotransmitter receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone and vomiting centre."
539,"It has significant activity against melanomas. Dacarbazine with Oblimersen is in clinical trials for the treatment of malignant melanoma.Dacarbazine is a synthetic analog of naturally occurring purine precursor 5-amino-1H-imidazole-4-carboxamide (AIC). 1 In a patient with renal and hepatic dysfunctions, the half-lives were lengthened to 55 minutes and 7.2 hours. At therapeutic concentrations dacarbazine is not appreciably bound to human plasma protein.The mechanism of action is not known, but appears to exert cytotoxic effects via its action as an alkylating agent. Other theories include DNA synthesis inhibition by its action as a purine analog, and interaction with SH groups."
540,"The decongestant effect of pseudoephedrine was described in dogs in 1927.Pseudoephedrine causes vasoconstriction which leads to a decongestant effect. It has a short duration of action unless formulated as an extended release product. This agonism of adrenergic receptors produces vasoconstriction which is used as a decongestant and as a treatment of priapism. The sympathomimetic effects of pseudoephedrine include an increase in mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and chronotropic response of the right atria. Pseudoephedrine is also a partial agonist of the anococcygeal muscle."
541,"Temozolomide is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma concomitantly with radiotherapy and for use as maintenance treatment thereafter. It is also indicated for the treatment of refractory anaplastic astrocytoma in adult patients or adjuvant therapy for adults with newly diagnosed anaplastic astrocytoma.Refractory anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO grade III) and Glioblastoma multiforme (WHO grade IV) are primary malignant brain tumours with poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Temozolomide is an imidazotetrazine prodrug that is stable at acidic pH but undergoes spontaneous nonenzymatic hydrolysis at neutral or slightly basic pH; these properties allow for both oral and intravenous administration. Pneumocystis pneumonia may occur in patients undergoing treatment, and prophylaxis should be provided for patients in the concomitant phase of therapy with monitoring at all stages. If not repaired by MGMT, O6-MeG mispairs with thymine, activating the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) pathway that removes the thymine (not the O6-MeG), resulting in futile cycles of repair and eventual DNA strand breaks leading to apoptosis."
542,"For the management of moderate to severe pain or as a preoperative medication where an opioid analgesic is appropriate.A narcotic analgesic that may be habit-forming. It is nearly as effective orally as by injection.Levorphanol is a potent synthetic opioid analgesic indicated for the management of moderate to severe pain or as a preoperative medication where an opioid analgesic is appropriate. Levorphanol is similar to morphine in its actions, however it is up to 8 times more potent than morphine. Levorphanol produces a degree of respiratory depression similar to that produced by morphine at equianalgesic doses, and like many mu-opioid drugs, levorphanol produces euphoria or has a positive effect on mood in many individuals.Like other mu-agonist opioids it is believed to act at receptors in the periventricular and periaqueductal gray matter in both the brain and spinal cord to alter the transmission and perception of pain."
543,"Terbinafine hydrochloride also treats yeast infections of the skin caused by _Candida_ species and _Malassezia furfur_.Terbinafine hydrochloride (Lamisil) is a synthetic allylamine antifungal. It is highly lipophilic in nature and tends to accumulate in skin, nails, and fatty tissues. Terbinafine hydrochloride was granted FDA approval on 30 December 1992.Terbinafine is an allylamine antifungal that inhibits squalene epoxidase (also known as squalene monooxygenase) to prevent the formation of ergosterol and cause an accumulation of squalene, weakening the cell wall of fungal cells. Terbinafine distributes into tissues and has a long terminal elimination half life, so the duration of action is long. Overdose with terbinafine is rare, even above the therapeutic dose, so the therapeutic index is wide."
544,"For treatment of Wilson's disease, cystinuria and active rheumatoid arthritis.Penicillamine is a pharmaceutical of the chelator class. It is also used to reduce cystine excretion in cystinuria and to treat patients with severe, active rheumatoid arthritis unresponsive to conventional therapy. In Wilson's disease it binds copper, allowing it to be eliminated in the urine.Penicillamine is a chelating agent recommended for the removal of excess copper in patients with Wilson's disease. The mechanism of action of penicillamine in rheumatoid arthritis is unknown although it appears to suppress disease activity. Also unlike cytotoxic immunosuppressants which act on both, penicillamine in vitro depresses T-cell activity but not B-cell activity."
545,"Prednisolone is indicated to treat endocrine, rheumatic, and hematologic disorders; collagen, dermatologic, ophthalmic, respiratory, and gastrointestinal diseases; allergic and edematous states; and other conditions like tuberculous meningitis.Prednisolone is a glucocorticoid similar to  used for its anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, anti-neoplastic, and vasoconstrictive effects. Prednisolone was granted FDA approval on 21 June 1955.Corticosteroids bind to the glucocorticoid receptor, inhibiting pro-inflammatory signals, and promoting anti-inflammatory signals. Prednisolone has a short duration of action as the half life is 2.1-3.5 hours. Patients taking corticosteroids should be counselled regarding the risk of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression and increased susceptibility to infections.The short term effects of corticosteroids are decreased vasodilation and permeability of capillaries, as well as decreased leukocyte migration to sites of inflammation. Lower doses of corticosteroids provide an anti-inflammatory effect, while higher doses are immunosuppressive."
546,"Diflunisal is used to relieve pain accompanied with inflammation and in the symptomatic treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.Diflunisal is a nonsteroidal drug with analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties. Chemically, diflunisal differs from aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) in two respects. Diflunisal is not metabolized to salicylic acid, and the fluorine atoms are not displaced from the difluorophenyl ring structure.The precise mechanism of the analgesic and anti-inflammatory actions of diflunisal is not known. Diflunisal is a prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor. Since prostaglandins are known to be among the mediators of pain and inflammation, the mode of action of diflunisal may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues."
547,"During sexual stimulation, nitric oxide (NO) is released from nerve endings and endothelial cells in the corpus cavernosum, activating the enzyme guanylate cyclase and increasing the synthesis of cGMP in the smooth muscle cells of the corpus cavernosum. PDE5 inhibitors, such as vardenafil, inhibit the degradation of cGMP and allow increased blood flow into the penis, resulting in an erection.. The use of vardenafil as a monotherapy for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension has also been evaluated.Vardenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), an enzyme responsible for the degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. Without sexual stimulation and no cGMP production, vardenafil should not cause an erection. Patients taking PDE5 inhibitors, such as vardenafil, may also develop sudden hearing loss and experience a prolonged QT interval.Vardenafil inhibits cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP) specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for the degradation of cyclic GMP in the corpus cavernosum located around the penis."
548,"It also used in the short term treatment of active benign gastric ulcers and maintenance therapy of gastric ulcers at a reduced dose. In addition to the above, ranitidine can be used for the treatment of GERD symptoms, treatment of erosive esophagitis (endoscopically diagnosed) and the maintenance of gastric or duodenal ulcer healing.Ranitidine is a commonly used drug, classified as a histamine H2-receptor antagonist, and belongs to the same drug class as  and . This drug helps to prevent and treat gastric-acid associated conditions, including ulcers, because of its ability to decrease gastric acid secretion. Ranitidine has proven to be an effective treatment for relieving uncomfortable symptoms of gastric acid associated conditions and is therefore widely used in GERD and other gastric-acid related conditions.Ranitidine decreases the secretion of gastric acid stimulated by food and drugs. Ranitidine reduces the secretion of gastric acid by reversible binding to histamine (H2) receptors, which are found on gastric parietal cells."
549,"This FKBP12-FK506 complex inhibits calcineurin which inhibits T-lymphocyte signal transduction and IL-2 transcription.Tacrolimus acts by reducing peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity by binding to the immunophilin FKBP-12 (FK506 binding protein) creating a new complex. This inhibits both T-lymphocyte signal transduction and IL-2 transcription. Tacrolimus has also been shown to be effective in the topical treatment of eczema, particularly atopic eczema. On other parts of the body, topical steroid are generally a better treatment.The mechanism of action of tacrolimus in atopic dermatitis is not known. It has been demonstrated that tacrolimus inhibits T-lymphocyte activation by first binding to an intracellular protein, FKBP-12."
550,"For the treatment of hypertension, angina, and arrhythmiaOne of the adrenergic beta-antagonists used as an antihypertensive, anti-anginal, and anti-arrhythmic agent. Alprenolol is no longer marketed by AstraZeneca, but may still be available in generic varieties.Alprenolol is a non-selective beta-blocker used in the treatment of hypertension, edema, ventricular tachycardias, and atrial fibrillation. Alprenolol impairs AV node conduction and decreases sinus rate and may also increase plasma triglycerides and decrease HDL-cholesterol levels. Alprenolol is nonpolar and hydrophobic, with low to moderate lipid solubility. Alprenolol has little to no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and, unlike some other beta-adrenergic blocking agents, alprenolol has little direct myocardial depressant activity and does not have an anesthetic-like membrane-stabilizing action.Alprenolol non-selectively blocks beta-1 adrenergic receptors mainly in the heart, inhibiting the effects of epinephrine and norepinephrine resulting in a decrease in heart rate and blood pressure."
551,"For the treatment and prophylaxis of premature labourAdrenergic beta-agonist used to control premature labor.Beta-2 adrenergic receptors are located at sympathetic neuroeffector junctions of many organs, including uterus. Ritodrine is beta-2 adrenergic agonist. The decrease of calcium concentration leads to a relaxation of uterine smooth muscle and, therefore, a decrease in premature uterine contractions. Ritodrine is beta-2 adrenergic agonist. It binds to beta-2 adrenergic receptors on outer membrane of myometrial cell, activates adenyl cyclase to increase the level of cAMP which decreases intracellular calcium and leads to a decrease of uterine contractions."
552,"Dorzolamide is indicated for the management of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma. Its pre-operative use was also investigated to prevent elevated intraocular pressure after neodynium yttrium aluminum garnet laser posterior capsulotomy.Dorzolamide is a non-bacteriostatic sulfonamide derivative  and topical carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitor that treats elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) associated with open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension. First marketed in 1995, dorzolamide is available in ophthalmic solutions as monotherapy marketed as Trusopt  or in combination with  as Cosopt PF.Dorzolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that reduces elevated intraocular pressure in open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. When there is an increase in the resistance to the trabecular outflow of aqueous humour, the intraocular pressure is elevated. The inhibition of CA-II in the ciliary process disrupts the formation of bicarbonate ions and reduces sodium and fluid transport, which leads to decreased aqueous humour secretion and reduced intraocular pressure."
553,"Used as eye drops to inhibit the miosis (pupil constriction) that may occur during ocular surgery.An ibuprofen-type anti-inflammatory analgesic and antipyretic. It inhibits prostaglandin synthesis and has been proposed as an anti-arthritic. Ophthalmic anti-inflammatory medicines are used in the eye to lessen problems that can occur during or after some kinds of eye surgery. Suprofen is used to help prevent this.Suprofen binds to the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) isoenzymes, preventing the synthesis of prostaglandins and reducing the inflammatory response. The overall result is a reduction in pain and inflammation in the eyes and the prevention of pupil constriction during surgery."
554,"Conivaptan inhibits both isotypes of the vasopressin receptor (V1a and V2).Conivaptan is a nonpeptide, dual antagonist of arginine vasopressin (AVP) V1A and V2 receptors. The level of AVP in circulating blood is critical for the regulation of water and electrolyte balance and is usually elevated in both euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. These receptors help to maintain plasma osmolality within the normal range by increasing permeability of the renal collecting ducts to water. Vasopressin also causes vasoconstriction through its actions on vascular 1A receptors. The predominant pharmacodynamic effect of conivaptan in the treatment of hyponatremia is through its V2 antagonism of AVP in the renal collecting ducts, an effect that results in aquaresis, or excretion of free water."
555,"A number of prescription loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic products are specifically indicated for the treatment of post-operative inflammation and pain following ocular surgery . Loteprednol Etabonate (LE) is a topical corticoid anti-inflammatory. Specifically, LE is an ester derivative of one of these analogs, cortienic acid etabonate . This inactive metabolite is more hydrophilic and is thus readily eliminated from the body . The use of LE subsequently treats post-operative inflammation and pain following ocular surgery by managing the prostaglandin release, recruitment and travel of neutrophils and macrophages, and production of other inflammatory mediators that are intrinsically associated with the physical trauma of surgery ."
556,"It is indicated for the management of depression in adult patients who may, or may not, also be showing signs of anxiety.Flupentixol is an antipsychotic drug of the thioxanthene group. The antipsychotic actions are mainly thought to arise from cis(Z)-flupentixol, the active stereoisomer, acting as an antagonist at both dopamine D1 and D2 receptors with equal affinities. It is generally understood that positive symptoms of schizophrenia arise from a dysregulated striatal dopamine pathway, leading to hyperstimulation of D2 receptors. However, there is now evidence that antipsychotic agents can work by blocking other dopamine receptor subtypes, such as D1, D3, or D4 receptors. One study showed that cis(Z)-flupentixol is an antagonist at both dopamine D1 and D2 receptors with equal affinities, and binds to D3 and D4 receptors with lower affinities."
557,"Also used as a first-line agent in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy, as well as a second-line agent in the treatment of congestive heart failure (only in those intolerant of ACE inhibitors).Eprosartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist used to treat hypertension. It performs 2 actions on the renin angiotensin system. By preventing the binding of angiotensin II to AT1, vascular smooth muscle relaxes and vasodilation occurs. It is responsible for effects such as vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. The resulting effect is a decrease in blood pressure.Eprosartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues (e.g., vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland)."
558,"In Europe, it is recommended that sirolimus for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in renal transplants is used in combination with cyclosporin microemulsion and corticosteroids for two to three months. Sirolimus was first approved by the FDA in 1999 for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients aged 13 years and older receiving renal transplants. In May 2015, the FDA approved sirolimus for the treatment of patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis. FKBP12-sirolimus complex binds to and inhibits the activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase that regulates cell growth, proliferation, survival, mobility, and angiogenesis. Sirolimus inhibits the activated mTOR pathway and proliferation of alveolar smooth muscle cell proliferation."
559,"Emtricitabine is a cytidine analogue. Emtricitabine was granted FDA approval on 2 July 2003.Emtricitabine is a cytidine analog that competes with the natural substrate of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase to be incorporated into newly formed DNA, terminating its transcription. It is administered once daily so it has a long duration of action. Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of  lactic acidosis and hepatomegaly with steatosis.Emtricitabine is a cytidine analog which, when phosphorylated to emtricitabine 5'-triphosphate, competes with deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate for HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. Inhibition of reverse transcriptase prevents transcription of viral RNA into DNA, therefore the virus is unable to incorporate its DNA into host DNA and replicate using host cell machinery."
560,"It is also indicated in the management of hypertension either as the sole therapeutic agent or to enhance the effectiveness of other antihypertensive drugs in the more severe forms of hypertension.A thiazide diuretic with actions and uses similar to those of hydrochlorothiazide. It inhibits Na+/Cl- reabsorption from the distal convoluted tubules in the kidneys. Thiazides also cause loss of potassium and an increase in serum uric acid. Chlorothiazide crosses the placental but not the blood-brain barrier and is excreted in breast milk.As a diuretic, chlorothiazide inhibits active chloride reabsorption at the early distal tubule via the Na-Cl cotransporter, resulting in an increase in the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water. The antihypertensive mechanism of chlorothiazide is less well understood although it may be mediated through its action on carbonic anhydrases in the smooth muscle or through its action on the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (KCa) channel, also found in the smooth muscle."
561,"Quinapril is indicated for the treatment of hypertension and as an adjunct therapy in the treatment of heart failure. A combination tablet with  was also approved on 28 December 1999.Quinapril is a prodrug of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor used in the treatment of hypertension or adjunct in the treatment of heart failure. This action can eventually lead to myocyte hypertrophy and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. Angiotensin II also stimulates production of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), increasing the risk of thrombosis. Quinaprilat prevents the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II by inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme, and also reduces the breakdown of bradykinin."
562,"A triphenyl ethylene stilbene derivative which is an estrogen agonist or antagonist depending on the target tissue.Clomifene (previously clomiphene) is an orally administered, non steroidal, ovulatory stimulant that acts as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). Clomifene can lead to multiple ovulation, and hence increase the risk of conceiving twins. In comparison to purified FSH, the rate of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is low. The first endocrine event, in response to a course of clomifene therapy, is an increase in the release of pituitary gonadotropins. Clomifene appears to stumulate the release of gonadotropins, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and leuteinizing hormone (LH), which leads to the development and maturation of ovarian follicle, ovulation, and subsequent development and function of the coprus luteum, thus resulting in pregnancy."
563,"For the prevention of angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease.A vasodilator used in the treatment of angina pectoris. Its actions are similar to nitroglycerin but with a slower onset of action.Isosorbide Dinitrate is a moderate to long acting oral organic nitrate used for the relief and prophylactic management of angina pectoris. It relaxes the vascular smooth muscle and consequent dilatation of peripheral arteries and veins, especially the latter. Dilatation of the veins promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end- diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance, systolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure.Isosorbide dinitrate is converted to the active nitric oxide to activate guanylate cyclase."
564,"Risedronic acid is indicated for the treatment of osteoperosis in men, treatment of Paget's disease, treatment and prevention of osteoperosis in postmenopausal women, and treatment and prevention of glucocorticoid-induced osteoperosis.Risedronic acid is a third generation bisphosphonate that is used for the treatment of some forms of osteoperosis and Paget's disease. It functions by preventing resorption of bone.Risedronate is a pyridine-based bisphosphonate that inhibits bone resorption caused by osteoclasts.Risedronatic acid binds to bone hydroxyapatite. Bone resorption causes local acidification, releasing risedronic acid which is that taken into osteoclasts by fluid-phase endocytosis. Endocytic vesicles are acidified, releasing risedronic acid to the cytosol of osteoclasts where they induce apoptosis through inhbition of farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase. Inhibition of osteoclasts results in decreased bone resorption."
565,"For the treatment of edema associated with congestive heart failure, hepatic and renal disease including the nephrotic syndrome.Bumetanide  is a sulfamyl diuretic.Bumetanide is a loop diuretic of the sulfamyl category to treat heart failure. It is often used in patients in whom high doses of furosemide are ineffective. There is however no reason not to use bumetanide as a first choice drug. The main difference between the two substances is in bioavailability. Bumetanide appears to block the active reabsorption of chloride and possibly sodium in the ascending loop of Henle, altering electrolyte transfer in the proximal tubule."
566,"For the palliative treatment of Hodgkin's disease (Stages III and IV), lymphosarcoma, chronic myelocytic or chronic lymphocytic leukemia, polycythemia vera, mycosis fungoides, and bronchogenic carcinoma. It was formerly used as a war gas. The FDA granted marketing approval for the orphan drug Valchlor (mechlorethamine) gel on August 23, 2013 for the topical treatment of stage IA and IB mycosis fungoides-type cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) in patients who have received prior skin-directed therapy. Each tube of Valchlor contains 0.016% of mechlorethamine which is equivalent to 0.02% mechlorethamine HCl.Mechlorethamine also known as mustine, nitrogen mustard, and HN2, is the prototype anticancer chemotherapeutic drug. Alkylating agents work by three different mechanisms all of which achieve the same end result - disruption of DNA function and cell death.Alkylating agents work by three different mechanisms: 1) attachment of alkyl groups to DNA bases, resulting in the DNA being fragmented by repair enzymes in their attempts to replace the alkylated bases, preventing DNA synthesis and RNA transcription from the affected DNA, 2) DNA damage via the formation of cross-links (bonds between atoms in the DNA) which prevents DNA from being separated for synthesis or transcription, and 3) the induction of mispairing of the nucleotides leading to mutations."
567,"Granisetron has little or no affinity for other serotonin receptors, including 5-HT 1 , 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 1B/C , or 5-HT 2 ; for alpha 1 -, alpha 2 -, or beta-adrenoreceptors; for dopamine D 2 receptors; for histamine H 1 receptors; for benzodiazepine receptors; for picrotoxin receptors; or for opioid receptors. The drug is structurally and pharmacologically related to ondansetron, another selective inhibitor of 5-HT3 receptors. The serontonin 5-HT3 receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery, and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. The serotonin then stimulates the vagal and splanchnic nerve receptors that project to the medullary vomiting center, as well as the 5-HT3 receptors in the area postrema, thus initiating the vomiting reflex, causing nausea and vomiting.Granisetron is a potent, selective antagonist of 5-HT3 receptors. This inhibition of 5-HT3 receptors in turn inhibits the visceral afferent stimulation of the vomiting center, likely indirectly at the level of the area postrema, as well as through direct inhibition of serotonin activity within the area postrema and the chemoreceptor trigger zone."
568,"The sulfonamides are synthetic bacteriostatic antibiotics with a wide spectrum against most gram-positive and many gram-negative organisms. However, many strains of an individual species may be resistant. Although these drugs are no longer used to treat meningitis, CSF levels are high in meningeal infections. Their antibacterial action is inhibited by pus.Sulfapyridine is a competitive inhibitor of the bacterial enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase. The inhibited reaction is necessary in these organisms for the synthesis of folic acid by means of processing the substrate para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)."
569,"Used to temporarily numb the front surface of the eye so that the eye pressure can be measured or a foreign body removed.Oxybuprocaine (also known as Benoxinate) is a local anesthetic, which is used especially in ophthalmology and otolaryngology. Oxybuprocaine binds to sodium channels and reversibly stabilizes the neuronal membrane which decreases its permeability to sodium ions.Oxybuprocaine is a local anaesthetic. It may be less irritating than tetracaine, and the onset and duration of action are similar to tetracaine.Oxybuprocaine binds to sodium channel and reversibly stabilizes the neuronal membrane which decreases its permeability to sodium ions. Depolarization of the neuronal membrane is inhibited thereby blocking the initiation and conduction of nerve impulses."
570,"For treatment of patients with documented iron deficiency in whom oral administration is unsatisfactory or impossible. Iron Dextran is used for the treatment of patients with documented iron deficiency in which oral administration is unsatisfactory or impossible.Iron dextran is a dark brown, slightly viscous sterile liquid complex of ferric hydroxide and dextran for intravenous or intramuscular use. Iron is essential to the formation of hemoglobin and to the function and formation of other heme and nonheme compounds. The iron is immediately bound to the available protein moieties to form hemosiderin or ferritin, the physiological forms of iron, or to a lesser extent to transferrin. This iron which is subject to physiological control replenishes hemoglobin and depleted iron stores."
571,"It is used to treat inflammation in the eye. Corticosteroids suppress the inflammatory response to a variety of inciting agents of a mechanical, chemical, or immunological nature. They inhibit edema, cellular infiltration, capillary dilatation, fibroblastic proliferation, deposition of collagen and scar formation associated with inflammation.Rimexolone is a glucocorticoid receptor agonist. The antiinflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition of arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. By binding to the glucocorticoid receptor, this drug ultimately leads to changes in genetic transcription involving the lipocortins and prostaglandins."
572,"For the short-term treatment of insomnia.Withdrawn in the United Kingdom due to risk of psychiatric adverse drug reactions. Internationally, triazolam is a Schedule IV drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances.A short-acting benzodiazepine used as a hypnotic agent in the treatment of insomnia. Some countries temporarily withdrew triazolam from the market because of concerns about adverse reactions, mostly psychological, associated with higher dose ranges. Its use at lower doses with appropriate care and labeling has been reaffirmed by the FDA and most other countries. As benzodiazepine receptors are thought to be coupled to gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptors, this enhances the effects of GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA receptor."
573,"It is widely used as a solvent and preservative in pharmaceutical preparations as well as serving as the primary ingredient in alcoholic beverages.Alcohol produces injury to cells by dehydration and precipitation of the cytoplasm or protoplasm. When alcohol is injected in close proximity to nerve tissues, it produces neuritis and nerve degeneration (neurolysis). Ninety to 98% of ethanol that enters the body is completely oxidized. Ethanol also binds to GABA, glycine, NMDA receptors and modulates their effects. Alcohol also binds directly to the receptors for acetylcholine, serotonin, GABA, and the NMDA receptors for glutamate."
574,"For use during the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia.Remifentanil (marketed by Abbott as Ultiva) is a potent ultra short-acting synthetic opioid given to patients during surgery for pain relief and adjunctive to an anaesthetic. The opioid activity of remifentanil is antagonized by opioid antagonists such as naloxone. The analgesic effects of remifentanil are rapid in onset and offset. Remifentanil in humans has a rapid blood-brain equilibration half-time of 1 &plusmn; 1 minutes (mean &plusmn; SD) and a rapid onset of action.Remifentanil is a &micro;-opioid agonist with rapid onset and peak effect, and short duration of action. The &micro;-opioid activity of remifentanil is antagonized by opioid antagonists such as naloxone."
575,"Didanosine is a hypoxanthine attached to the sugar ring, unlike other nucleoside analogues. Didanosine is effective against HIV, and usually used in combination with other antiviral therapy. Switching from long term AZT treatment to didanosine has been shown to be beneficial. Didanosine has weak acid stability and therefore, it is often combined with an antacid.Didanosine (ddI) is metabolized intracellularly by a series of cellular enzymes to its active moiety, dideoxyadenosine triphosphate (ddATP), which inhibits the HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme competitively by competing with natural dATP. It also acts as a chain terminator by its incorporation into viral DNA as the lack of a 3'-OH group in the incorporated nucleoside analogue prevents the formation of the 5' to 3' phosphodiester linkage essential for DNA chain elongation, and therefore, the viral DNA growth is terminated."
576,"Used to dilate air passages in the lungs that have become narrowed as a result of disease or inflammation. It is a beta-2-adrenergic receptor agonist. Bitolterol was withdrawn from the market by Elan Pharmaceuticals in 2001.Bitolterol, an adrenergic bronchodilator, is a prodrug that widens constricted airways in the lungs by relaxing the smooth muscles that surround the bronchial passages. Bitolterol is unique in that it is a prodrug because it must first be metabolized by the body before it becomes active.Bitolterol is an adrenergic beta-2 agonist. Asthma results from a narrowing of the bronchial tubes."
577,"This pharmacological action results in excretion of these ions, increased urinary output, and reduction in extracellular fluid. Ethacrynic acid acts on the ascending limb of the loop of Henle and on the proximal and distal tubules. Ethacrynic acid has little or no effect on glomerular filtration or on renal blood flow, except following pronounced reductions in plasma volume when associated with rapid diuresis.Ethacrynic acid inhibits symport of sodium, potassium, and chloride primarily in the ascending limb of Henle, but also in the proximal and distal tubules. This pharmacological action results in excretion of these ions, increased urinary output, and reduction in extracellular fluid. Diuretics also lower blood pressure initially by reducing plasma and extracellular fluid volume; cardiac output also decreases, explaining its antihypertensive action."
578,"In the adult patient population:  i) orally administered ondansetron tablets and orally disintegrating tablets (ODT) are indicated for:  - the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including high dose (ie. It is effective in the treatment of nausea and vomiting caused by cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs, including cisplatin, and has reported anxiolytic and neuroleptic properties. The serotonin then stimulates the vagal and splanchnic nerve receptors that project to the medullary vomiting center, as well as the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors in the area postrema, thus initiating the vomiting reflex, causing nausea and vomiting , . At the highest tested dose of 32 mg, prolongation of the Fridericia-corrected QTc interval (QT/RR0.33=QTcF) was observed from 15 min to 4 h after the start of the 15 min infusion, with a maximum mean (upper limit of 90% CI) difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline-correction of 19.6 (21.5) msec at 20 min . Cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy are associated with the release of serotonin (5-HT) from enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine, presumably initiating a vomiting reflex through stimulation of 5-HT3 receptors located on vagal afferents ."
579,"Bimatoprost is used for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Bimatoprost rapidly decreases intraocular pressure and reduces the risk for visual field loss from ocular hypertension due to various causes. Patients should be informed of these possible effects, especially if this drug is only administered to one eye, which may noticeably change in appearance with bimatoprost treatment.Bimatoprost imitates the effects of prostamides, specifically prostaglandin F2α. Bimatoprost mildly stimulates aqueous humor outflow, relieving elevated intraocular pressure and decreasing the risk of optic nerve damage. It achieves the above effects by decreasing tonographic resistance to aqueous humor outflow."
580,"It is a local anesthetic and vasoconstrictor and is clinically used for that purpose, particularly in the eye, ear, nose, and throat. Cocaine, like amphetamines, acts by multiple mechanisms on brain catecholaminergic neurons; the mechanism of its reinforcing effects is thought to involve inhibition of dopamine uptake.Cocaine is a local anesthetic indicated for the introduction of local (topical) anesthesia of accessible mucous membranes of the oral, laryngeal and nasal cavities.Cocaine produces anesthesia by inhibiting excitation of nerve endings or by blocking conduction in peripheral nerves. This is achieved by reversibly binding to and inactivating sodium channels. Cocaine is the only local anesthetic with vasoconstrictive properties. This is a result of its blockade of norepinephrine reuptake in the autonomic nervous system."
581,"Quinidine is considered the first antiarrhythmic drug (class Ia) and is moderately efficacious in the acute conversion of atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm. It prolongs cellular action potential by blocking sodium and potassium currents. However, it continues to be used in the treatment of Brugada syndrome, short QT syndrome and idiopathic ventricular fibrillation.Quinidine is an antimalarial schizonticide, and a class Ia antiarrhythmic agent used to interrupt or prevent reentrant arrhythmias and arrhythmias due to increased automaticity, such as atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Quinidine also causes a marked prolongation of the QT interval in a dose-related manner, acts peripherally as an α-adrenergic antagonist, and has anticholinergic and negative inotropic activity. Patients treated with quinidine may also be at risk of a paradoxical increase in ventricular rate in atrial flutter/fibrillation, and patients with sick sinus syndrome treated with quinidine may develop marked sinus node depression and bradycardia.Quinidine has a complex electrophysiological profile that has not been fully elucidated."
582,"Zonisamide oral suspension is indicated as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in adults and pediatric patients 16 years of age and older.Zonisamide is a sulfonamide anticonvulsant used as an adjunctive therapy in adults with partial-onset seizures. This latter action may inhibit the uptake of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA while enhancing the uptake of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. In 1989, it was approved for commercial use in Japan. Zonisamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, which may lead to metabolic acidosis in patients treated with this drug. However, its antiepileptic properties may be due to its effects on sodium and calcium channels."
583,"Paricalcitol is indicated for the prevention and treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with chronic renal failure.Secondary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by an elevation in parathyroid hormone (PTH) associated with inadequate levels of active vitamin D hormone. The source of vitamin D in the body is from synthesis in the skin and from dietary intake. Vitamin D requires two sequential hydroxylations in the liver and the kidney to bind to and to activate the vitamin D receptor (VDR). In the diseased kidney, the activation of vitamin D is diminished, resulting in a rise of PTH, subsequently leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism and disturbances in the calcium and phosphorus homeostasis.1 Decreased levels of 1,25(OH)2 D3 have been observed in early stages of chronic kidney disease. An in vitro study indicates that paricalcitol is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 or CYP3A at concentrations up to 50 nM (21 ng/mL).Paricalcitol is a synthetic, biologically active vitamin D analog of calcitriol with modifications to the side chain (D2) and the A (19-nor) ring."
584,"Tinidazole demonstrates activity both in vitro and in clinical infections against the following protozoa: Trichomonas vaginalis, Giardia duodenalis (also termed G. lamblia), and Entamoeba histolytica. Tinidazole does not appear to have activity against most strains of vaginal lactobacilli.Tinidazole is a prodrug and antiprotozoal agent. The nitro group of tinidazole is reduced in Trichomonas by a ferredoxin-mediated electron transport system. The free nitro radical generated as a result of this reduction is believed to be responsible for the antiprotozoal activity. It is suggested that the toxic free radicals covalently bind to DNA, causing DNA damage and leading to cell death."
585,"As an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Membrane potential is regulated through an inverse relationship between the activity of cell membrane ATP-sensitive potassium channels (ABCC8) and extracellular glucose concentrations. Once inside the cell, glucose is metabolized to produce ATP. Repaglinide activity is dependent on the presence functioning &beta; cells and glucose. The insulinotropic effects of repaglinide are highest at intermediate glucose levels (3 to 10 mmol/L) and it does not increase insulin release already stimulated by high glucose concentrations (greater than 15 mmol/L)."
586,"For treatment and management of pain (systemic) and for use as an anesthesia adjunct.Anileridine is a synthetic opioid and strong analgesic medication. It is a narcotic pain reliever used to treat moderate to severe pain. Narcotic analgesics act in the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain. It may also be used as an analgesic adjunct in general anesthesia in the same manner as meperidine to reduce the amount of anesthetic needed, to facilitate relaxation, and to reduce laryngospasm. Anileridine's main pharmacologic action is exerted on the CNS."
587,"For the reatment of type II diabetes mellitus.A biguanide hypoglycemic agent with actions and uses similar to those of metformin. Although it is generally considered to be associated with an unacceptably high incidence of lactic acidosis, often fatal, it is still available in some countries. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p290)Used to treat diabetes, phenformin is a biguanide (contains 2 guanidino groups) hypoglycemic agent with actions and uses similar to those of metformin (Glucophage). Both drugs work by (1) decreasing the absorption of glucose by the intestines, (2) decreasing the production of glucose in the liver, and by (3) increasing the body's ability to use insulin more effectively. Phenformin is generally considered to be associated with an unacceptably high incidence of actic acidosis."
588,"Metronidazole is indicated for the treatment of confirmed trichomoniasis caused by Trichomonas vaginalis (except for in the first trimester of pregnancy) and the patient's sexual partners, bacterial vaginosis, certain types of amebiasis, and various anaerobic infections. It is frequently used to treat gastrointestinal infections as well as trichomoniasis and giardiasis, and amebiasis which are parasitic infections. Metronidazole is an effective treatment for some anaerobic bacterial infections. Following this, ferredoxin or flavodoxin reduce its nitro group to nitro radicals. These include N-(2-hydroxyethyl) oxamic acid and acetamide, which may damage DNA of replicating organisms."
589,"Also used in the management of nonmetastatic gestational trophoblastic disease (benign hydatidiform mole). It also stimulates osteoblasts to release factors which stimualtes bone resorption by osteoclasts. As a prescription drug it is used as a vaginal suppository, to prepare the cervix for labour and to induce labour.Dinoprostone is equivalent to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). It stimulates labor and delivery by stimulating the uterine, and thus terminates pregnancy. The exact mechanism of action for this effect is also unknown, but it has been suggested that this effect may be associated with collagen degradation caused by secretion of the enzyme collagenase as a partial response to locally administered dinoprostone."
590,"Administered orally, ketotifen is indicated as an add-on medication in the chronic treatment of mild atopic asthma in children. It is also available as an over-the-counter ophthalmic solution which is indicated for the temporary prevention of itching of the eye due to allergic conjunctivitis.Ketotifen is a benzocycloheptathiophene derivative with potent antihistaminic and mast cell stabilizing properties. It has a similar structure to some other first-generation antihistamines such as  and . In the US, it is now used in an over-the-counter ophthalmic formulation for the treatment of itchy eyes associated with allergies, and in Canada a prescription-only oral formulation is available and indicated as an add-on therapy for children with atopic asthma. In addition, oral ketotifen is used in Mexico and across Europe for the treatment of various allergic symptoms and disorders, including urticaria, mastocytosis, and food allergy.Ketotifen is a non-competitive histamine antagonist and mast cell stabilizer."
591,"It is also commonly used as an alternative to  for the treatment of severe opioid addiction. **Withdrawal**    Abrupt discontinuation of treatment is not recommended as it may result in an opioid withdrawal syndrome that may be delayed in onset. **Precipitation of Opioid Withdrawal Signs and Symptoms**    If buprenorphine is started in opioid-dependent individuals, it will displace the other opioids and cause a phenomenon known as ""precipitated withdrawal"" which is characterized by a rapid and intense onset of withdrawal symptoms. Buprenorphine/naloxone products may be used with caution for maintenance treatment in patients with moderate hepatic impairment who have initiated treatment on a buprenorphine product without naloxone. Buprenorphine's high affinity, but low intrinsic activity for the mu-opioid receptor also means that if it is started in opioid-dependent individuals, it will displace the other opioids without creating an equal opioid effect and cause a phenomenon known as ""precipitated withdrawal"" which is characterized by a rapid and intense onset of withdrawal symptoms (i.e. anxiety, restlessness, gastrointestinal distress, diaphoresis, intense drug cravings, and tachycardia)."
592,"For short term treatment of acutely decompensated severe chronic heart failure (CHF). This increases contractility without raising calcium levels. Levosimendan has not been approved for use in the U.S. or Canada.Levosimendan appears to increase myofilament calcium sensitivity by binding to cardiac troponin C in a calcium-dependent manner. This stabilizes the calcium-induced conformational change of troponin C, thereby (1) changing actin-myosin cross-bridge kinetics apparently without increasing the cycling rate of the cross-bridges or myocardial ATP consumption, (2) increasing the effects of calcium on cardiac myofilaments during systole and (3) improving contraction at low energy cost (inotropic effect). Levosimendan also has a selective phosphodiesterase (PDE)-III inhibitory action that may contribute to the inotropic effect of this compound under certain experimental conditions."
593,"For the treatment of infections caused by susceptible organisms.Ceforanide is administered parenterally. It has a longer elimination half-life than any currently available cephalosporin. Its activity is very similar to that of cefamandole, another second-generation cephalosporin antibiotic, except that ceforanide is less active against most gram-positive organisms. Many coliforms, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Proteus, are susceptible to ceforanide, as are most strains of Salmonella, Shigella, Hemophilus, Citrobacter and Arizona species.Ceforanide is a semisynthetic second-generation cephalosporin. The cephalosporins are bactericidal drugs with both gram-positive and gram-negative activity."
594,"It has not been found effective in the treatment of spasticity originating from cerebral or spinal cord disease, or spasticity in children with cerebral palsy. It was initially studied for use as antidepressant given its structural similarity to tricyclic antidepressants - it differs from  by only a single double bond. Since its approval, it has remained relatively popular as an adjunctive, short-term treatment for acute skeletal muscle spasms secondary to musculoskeletal injury.Cyclobenzaprine is a skeletal muscle relaxant that works on areas of the brainstem to reduce skeletal muscle spasm, though its exact pharmacodynamic behaviour is currently unclear. Despite its long half-life, it is relatively short-acting with a typical duration of action of 4-6 hours. More recently it has been suggested that inhibition of descending serotonergic pathways in the spinal cord via action on 5-HT2 receptors may contribute to cyclobenzaprine’s observed effects."
595,"For the treatment of severe psoriasis in adults.Etretinate is a medication used to treat severe psoriasis. Etretinate is also believed to enhance the binding of cAMP to the regulatory RI subunit of cAMP dependent protein kinases. Etretinate was taken off the market in Canada in 1996 and America in 1998 due to the risk of birth defects. Acitretin works by inhibiting the excessive cell growth and keratinisation (process by which skin cells become thickened due to the deposition of a protein within them) seen in psoriasis. It therefore reduces the thickening of the skin, plaque formation and scaling.The mechanism of action of the active metabolite, acitretin, is unknown, however it is believed to work by targeting specific receptors (retinoid receptors) in the skin which help normalize the growth cycle of skin cells."
596,"Off-label uses of famotidine include the reduction of NSAIDs-associated gastrointestinal effects, treatment of refractory urticarial, prevention of stress ulcer in critically-ill patients, and symptomatic relief of gastritis.Famotidine is a competitive histamine-2 (H2) receptor antagonist that works to inhibit gastric acid secretion. It is commonly used in gastrointestinal conditions related to acid secretion, such as gastric ulcers and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), in adults and children. The duration of effect is about 10-12 hours.Histamine acts as a local hormone that stimulates the acid output by parietal cells via a paracrine mechanism. Gastrin (G) cells release gastrin, which works on CCK2 receptors on ECL cells. This action promotes the release of histamine from ECL cells."
597,"As an analogue of cytidine, it is able to incorporate into RNA and DNA, disrupting RNA metabolism and inhibiting protein and DNA synthesis. The other one is through the inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, impairing DNA methylation. Due to its anti-neoplastic activity and its ability to inhibit methylation in replicating DNA, azacytidine has been used mainly used in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), two types of cancer characterized by the presence of aberrant DNA methylation. The use of oral azacitidine for the treatment of AML in patients in complete remission was approved by the FDA in September 2020.The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis, and hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes critical for differentiation and proliferation. On the other hand, the incorporation of azacitidine into RNA and DNA leads to cytotoxicity as follows: Following cellular uptake, azacitidine is phosphorylated by uridine-cytidine kinase to form 5-azacytidine monophosphate."
598,"Misoprostol is indicated as a tablet to reduce the risk of NSAID induced gastric ulcers but not duodenal ulcers in high risk patients. Misoprostol is used off label for the management of miscarriages, prevention of post partum hemorrhage, and is also used alone or in combination with mifepristone in other countries for first trimester abortions.Misoprostol is a prostaglandin analog used to reduce the risk of NSAID related ulcers, manage miscarriages, prevent post partum hemorrhage, and also for first trimester abortions. Misoprostol is also used to manage miscarriages and used alone or in combination with mifepristone for first trimester abortions. An oral dose of misoprostol has an 8 minute onset of action and a duration of action of approximately 2 hours, a sublingual dose has an 11 minute onset of action and a duration of action of approximately 3 hours, a vaginal dose has a 20 minute onset of action and a duration of action of approximately 4 hours, and a rectal dose has a 100 minute onset of action and a duration of action of approximately 4 hours.Misoprostol is a synthetic prostaglandin E1 analog that stimulates prostaglandin E1 receptors on parietal cells in the stomach to reduce gastric acid secretion. Misoprostol binds to smooth muscle cells in the uterine lining to increase the strength and frequency of contractions as well as degrade collagen and reduce cervical tone."
599,"For the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitisA broad-spectrum semisynthetic antibiotic related to tetracycline but excreted more slowly and maintaining effective blood levels for a more extended period.Methacycline is a tetracycline antibiotic. It is active against most Gram-positive bacteria (pneumococci, streptococci, staphylococci) and Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, salmonella, shigella, etc. ), and towards agents causing onithosis, psittacosis, trachoma, and some Protozoa. Like other tetracyclines, the general usefulness of methacycline has been reduced with the onset of bacterial resistance.Methacycline, a tetracycline antibiotic, is a protein synthesis inhibitors, inhibiting the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex. Tetracyclines also have been found to inhibit matrix metalloproteinases."
600,"Used in the treatment of schizophrenia, organic brain disorders, alcoholism and psychoneuroses.A phenothiazine antipsychotic with effects similar to chlorpromazine.Mesoridazine, the besylate salt of a metabolite of thioridazine, is a phenothiazine tranquilizer. Pharmacological studies in laboratory animals have established that mesoridazine has a spectrum of pharmacodynamic actions typical of a major tranquilizer. It is effective in blocking spinal reflexes in the cut and antagonizes d-amphetamine excitation and toxicity in grouped mice. Intravenously administered, it lowers the blood pressure of anesthetized dogs. It has a weak antiacetylcholine effect in vitro.Based upon animal studies, mesoridazine, as with other phenothiazines, acts indirectly on reticular formation, whereby neuronal activity into reticular formation is reduced without affecting its intrinsic ability to activate the cerebral cortex."
601,"For treatment of depression, including the depressed phase of bipolar depression, psychotic depression, and involutional melancholia, and may also be helpful in treating certain patients suffering severe depressive neurosis.Maprotiline is a tetracyclic antidepressant with similar pharmacological properties to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Although its main therapeutic use is in the treatment of depression, it has also been shown to exert a sedative effect on the anxiety component that often accompanies depression. Maprotiline is a strong inhibitor of noradrenaline reuptake in the brain and peripheral tissues, however it is worthy to note that it is a weak inhibitor of serotonergic uptake. In addition, it displays strong antihistaminic action (which may explain its sedative effects) as well as weak anticholinergic action. Maprotiline is also a moderate peripheral &alpha;1 adrenergic antagonist, which may explain the occasional orthostatic hypotension reported in association with its use."
602,"Oxymetazoline is indicated for the topical treatment of persistent facial erythema associated with rosacea in adults. As an effective decongestant, oxymetazoline is available in over-the-counter intranasal sprays used to relieve nasal and sinus congestion caused by a wide variety of conditions, such as common cold, hay fever, and upper respiratory allergies. In July 2020, the FDA approved the use of an ophthalmic formulation of oxymetazoline (Upneeq) in adults with acquired blepharoptosis, or ptosis, making it the first FDA-approved medical treatment for this medical condition.Oxymetazoline is an adrenergic α1- and α2-agonist and a direct-acting sympathomimetic drug. In blepharoptosis, it is hypothesized that oxymetazoline works by stimulating α-adrenergic receptors on the Müller muscle that elevates the upper eyelid, causing muscle contraction. Oxymetazoline relieves nasal congestion by vasoconstricting the respiratory microvasculature, in both resistance and capacitance blood vessels on the human nasal mucosa, leading to decreased nasal mucosal blood flow, edema, and airflow resistance."
603,"Its salts, the salicylates, are used as analgesics.Salicylic acid treats acne by causing skin cells to slough off more readily, preventing pores from clogging up. Salicylic acid is a key ingredient in many skin-care products for the treatment of acne, psoriasis, calluses, corns, keratosis pilaris, and warts. Because of its effect on skin cells, salicylic acid is used in several shampoos used to treat dandruff. Salicylic acid is also used as an active ingredient in gels which remove verrucas (plantar warts). It also competitively inhibits the transferring of the glucuronyl group of uridine-5-phosphoglucuronic acid (UDPGA) to a phenolic acceptor."
604,"Used in the management of exogenous obesity as a short-term adjunct (a few weeks) in a regimen of weight reduction based on caloric restriction.A appetite depressant considered to produce less central nervous system disturbance than most drugs in this therapeutic category. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1994, p2290)Diethylpropion is a sympathomimetic stimulant drug marketed as an appetite suppressant. Chemically, it is the N,N-diethyl analog of cathinone. It is theorized that diethylpropion can raise levels of leptin which signal satiety. It is also theorized that increased levels of the catecholamines are partially responsible for halting another chemical messenger known as neuropeptide Y."
605,"It has a longer duration of action than the short-acting beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist, . Salmeterol was granted FDA approval on 4 February 1994.Salmeterol is a long acting beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist that binds to both the active and exo sites of the beta-2 adrenergic receptor. Patients should be counselled regarding the risks of long acting beta agonist (LABA) monotherapy, hypokalemia, hypoglycemia, and not to take this drug with another LABA.Beta-2 adrenoceptor stimulation causes relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle, bronchodilation, and increased airflow. Salmeterol is hypothesized to bind to 2 sites on the beta-2 adrenoceptor. The hydrophilic tail of salmeterol binds to leucine residues in the exo-site of the beta-2 adrenoceptor almost irreversibly, allowing salmeterol to persist in the active site, which is responsible for it's long duration of action."
606,"For the relief of mild to moderate pain, for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea and for the treatment of idiopathic heavy menstrual blood loss. Also for relief of the signs and symptoms of acute and chronic rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent with antipyretic and antigranulation activities. It also inhibits prostaglandin biosynthesis.Meclofenamic acid is a nonsteroidal agent which has demonstrated anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activity in laboratory animals.The mode of action, like that of other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, is not known. Therapeutic action does not result from pituitary-adrenal stimulation. In vitro meclofenamic acid was found to be an inhibitor of human leukocyte 5-lipoxygenase activity."
607,Used as an adjunct with succinylcholine (or suxamethonium chloride) to prolong muscle relaxation and to prevent succinylcholine-induced muscle fasciculations.Hexafluronium bromide is a neuromuscular blocking agent used in anesthesiology to prolong and potentiate the skeletal muscle relaxing action of suxamethonium during surgery. There are two types of cholinesterase acetylcholinesterase and pseuodocholinesterase. The first hydrolyses acetylcholine more quickly; the latter hydrolyses butyrylcholine and succinylcholine more quickly. This is a silent condition that only manifests itself when people who have the deficiency receive the muscle relaxants succinylcholine or mivacurium during a surgery.Hexafluronium bromide is a non-competitive reversible inhibitor of human plasma cholinesterase or pseudocholinesterase. The esteratic site on cholistereases is where acetylcholine is hydrolyzed to acetic acid and choline.
608,"For the treatment of Human immunovirus (HIV) infections in conjunction with other antivirals.A dideoxynucleoside compound in which the 3'-hydroxyl group on the sugar moiety has been replaced by a hydrogen. This modification prevents the formation of 5' to 3' phosphodiester linkages, which are needed for the elongation of DNA chains, thus resulting in the termination of viral DNA growth. Its principal toxic side effect is axonal degeneration resulting in peripheral neuropathy.Zalcitabine is an analog of 2'-deoxycytidine that is pharmacologically related to but structurally different from other nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Within cells, zalcitabine is converted to its active metabolite, dideoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate (ddCTP), by the sequential action of cellular enzymes. ddCTP interferes with viral RNA-directed DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase) by competing for utilization of the natural substrate deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate (dCTP), as well as incorpating into viral DNA."
609,"For the topical treatment of chronic open-angle glaucoma.Demecarium is an indirect-acting parasympathomimetic agent that is used to treat glaucoma. It is a cholinesterase inhibitor or an anticholinesterase. Cholinesterase inhibitors prolong the effect of acetylcholine, which is released at the neuroeffector junction of parasympathetic postganglion nerves, by inactivating the cholinesterases that break it down. The outflow of the aqueous humor is facilitated, which leads to a reduction in intraocular pressure.Demecarium is a long-acting cholinesterase inhibitor and potent miotic. In the eye, this causes constriction of the iris sphincter muscle (causing miosis) and the ciliary muscle (affecting the accommodation reflex and causing a spasm of the focus to near vision)."
610,"Additionally, the extended-release form is used to decrease the risk of death and recurrent episodes of stroke in patients with a history of stroke or TIA . Also known as _Aspirin_, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) is a commonly used drug for the treatment of pain and fever due to various causes. This drug also inhibits platelet aggregation and is used in the prevention of blood clots stroke, and myocardial infarction (MI) . Prostaglandins increase the sensitivity of pain receptors and substances such as histamine and bradykinin. **Effects on platelet aggregation**    The inhibition of platelet aggregation by ASA occurs because of its interference with thromboxane A2 in platelets, caused by COX-1 inhibition."

612,"Fulvestrant is a drug treatment of hormone receptor (HR)-positive metastatic breast cancer in post-menopausal women with disease progression following anti-estrogen therapy. It is an estrogen receptor antagonist with no agonist effects, which works both by down-regulating and by degrading the estrogen receptor.Fulvestrant competitively and reversibly binds to estrogen receptors present in cancer cells and achieves its anti-estrogen effects through two separate mechanisms. First, fulvestrant binds to the receptors and downregulates them so that estrogen is no longer able to bind to these receptors. Second, fulvestrant degrades the estrogen receptors to which it is bound. Both of these mechanisms inhibit the growth of tamoxifen-resistant as well as estrogen-sensitive human breast cancer cell lines."
613,"Used to treat serious gram&ndash;negative infections of the lungs, urinary tract, and skin.Semisynthetic ampicillin-derived acylureido penicillin. It has been proposed for infections with certain anaerobes and may be useful in inner ear, bile, and CNS infections.Mezlocillin is a penicillin beta-lactam antibiotic used in the treatment of bacterial infections caused by susceptible, usually gram-positive, organisms. Mezlocillin has <i>in vitro</i> activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The bactericidal activity of mezlocillin results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis and is mediated through mezlocillin binding to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). Mezlocillin is stable against hydrolysis by a variety of beta-lactamases, including penicillinases, and cephalosporinases and extended spectrum beta-lactamases."
614,"In particular, in the adult patient population, it can be employed to treat partial seizures (with and without generalization). Alternatively, it is used to treat partial and generalized seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in children. It has a weak inhibitory effect on GABA receptor binding sites.Felbamate is an antiepileptic indicated as monotherapy or as an adjunct to other anticonvulsants for the treatment of partial seizures resulting from epilepsy. Receptor-binding studies <i>in vitro</i> indicate that felbamate has weak inhibitory effects on GABA-receptor binding, benzodiazepine receptor binding, and is devoid of activity at the MK-801 receptor binding site of the NMDA receptor-ionophore complex. However, felbamate does interact as an antagonist at the strychnine-insensitive glycine recognition site of the NMDA receptor-ionophore complex.The mechanism by which felbamate exerts its anticonvulsant activity is unknown, but in animal test systems designed to detect anticonvulsant activity, felbamate has properties in common with other marketed anticonvulsants."
615,"Fexofenadine is also available in combination with  for the symptomatic treatment of season allergic rhinitis in patients ≥12 years old.Fexofenadine is an over-the-counter second-generation antihistamine used in the treatment of various allergic symptoms. It is selective for the H1 receptor, carries little-to-no activity at off-targets, and does not cross the blood-brain barrier - this is in contrast to previous first-generation antihistamines, such as , which readily bind to off-targets that contribute to side effects such as sedation. Fexofenadine is the major active metabolite of  and is administered as a racemic mixture in which both enantiomers display approximately equivalent antihistamine activity.Fexofenadine relieves allergy symptoms by antagonizing the actions of histamine, an endogenous compound predominantly responsible for allergic symptomatology. The relatively long duration of action of fexofenadine (approximately 24 hours) allows for once or twice daily dosing, and its rapid absorption allows for an onset of action within 1-3 hours. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells."
616,"It remains the treatment of choice for tuberculosis.Isoniazid is a bactericidal agent active against organisms of the genus Mycobacterium, specifically M. tuberculosis, M. bovis and M. kansasii. Isoniazid is bactericidal when mycobacteria grow rapidly and bacteriostatic when they grow slowly.Isoniazid is a prodrug and must be activated by bacterial catalase. Specficially, activation is associated with reduction of the mycobacterial ferric KatG catalase-peroxidase by hydrazine and reaction with oxygen to form an oxyferrous enzyme complex. Once activated, isoniazid inhibits the synthesis of mycoloic acids, an essential component of the bacterial cell wall. Specifically isoniazid inhibits InhA, the enoyl reductase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, by forming a covalent adduct with the NAD cofactor."
617,"For the acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without aura in adults.Naratriptan is a triptan drug that is selective for the 5-hydroxytryptamine1 receptor subtype. It is typically used for the treatment of migraine headaches.Naratriptan is a selective agonist of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) type 1B and 1D receptors. Naratriptan has only a weak affinity for 5-HT1A, 5-HT5A, and 5-HT7 receptors and no significant affinity or pharmacological activity at 5-HT2, 5-HT3 or 5-HT4 receptor subtypes or at alpha1-, alpha2-, or beta-adrenergic, dopamine1,; dopamine2; muscarinic, or benzodiazepine receptors. This action in humans correlates with the relief of migraine headache. In addition to causing vasoconstriction, experimental data from animal studies show that Naratriptan also activates 5-HT1 receptors on peripheral terminals of the trigeminal nerve innervating cranial blood vessels, which may also contribute to the antimigrainous effect of Naratriptan in humans.Three distinct pharmacological actions have been implicated in the antimigraine effect of the triptans: (1) stimulation of presynaptic 5-HT1D receptors, which serves to inhibit both dural vasodilation and inflammation; (2) direct inhibition of trigeminal nuclei cell excitability via 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonism in the brainstem and (3) vasoconstriction of meningeal, dural, cerebral or pial vessels as a result of vascular 5-HT1B receptor agonism."
618,"Used in the treatment of migraines, rizatriptan was first approved in the US in 1998. Activation of the trigeminovascular system leads to the release of vasoactive neuropeptides (such as substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and neurokinin A) from the trigeminal nerve innervating the intracranial vessels and dura mater. An imbalance in serotonin (5-HT) levels has also been documented: 5-HT binds to 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors to promote trigeminal neuronal firing and vasoconstriction. Rizatriptan causes vasoconstriction of intracranial extracerebral blood vessels, which is thought to occur primarily via 5-HT1B receptors. It attenuates the release of vasoactive neuropeptides by the trigeminal nerve, which is thought to occur via neurogenic and central 5-HT1D receptors."
619,"For the treatment of the following mild-to-moderate infections caused by susceptible strains of microorganisms: acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, secondary bacterial infection of acute bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia, pharyngitis/tonsilitis, and uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections.Dirithromycin is a macrolide glycopeptide antibiotic used to treat many different types of bacterial infections, such as bronchitis, pneumonia, tonsillitis, and even skin infections.Dirithromycin is a pro-drug which is converted non-enzymatically during intestinal absorption into the microbiologically active moiety erythromycylamine. Erythromycylamine exerts its activity by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunits of susceptible mircoorganisms resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis. Dirithromycin/erythromycylamine has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms both in vitro and in clinical infections: Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains only), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.Dirithromycin prevents bacteria from growing, by interfering with their protein synthesis. Dirithromycin binds to the 50S subunit of the 70S bacterial ribosome, and thus inhibits the translocation of peptides. Dirithromycin has over 10 times higher affinity to the subunit 50S than erythromycin."
620,"Netilmicin inhibits protein synthesis in susceptible organisms by binding to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit and interfering with mRNA binding and the acceptor tRNA site. The bactericidal effect of netilmiicin is not fully understood.Netilmicin is a semisynthetic, water soluble antibiotic of the aminoglycoside group, produced by the fermentation of Micromonospora inyoensis, a species of actinomycete. Shigella sp. Many strains of the above organisms which are found to be resistant to other aminoglycosides, such as kanamycin, gentamicin, tobramycin and sisomicin, are susceptible to netilmicin in vitro. The combined effect of netilmicin and carbenicillin or ticarcillin is synergistic for many strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa."
621,"Historically, hydrocodone has been used as a cough suppressant although this has largely been replaced by  in current cough and cold formulations. Hydrocodone's more potent metabolite,  has also found wide use as an analgesic and is frequently used in cases of severe pain. Its actions in the brain also produce euphoria, respiratory depression, and sedation.Hydrocodone binds to the mu opioid receptor (MOR) with the highest affinity followed by the delta opioid receptors (DOR). In the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, activation of pre-synaptic MOR on primary afferents the inhibition of calcium channel opening and increased activity of GIRK channels hyperpolarizes the neuron and prevents release of neurotransmitters. MOR can also inhibit GABAergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area, removing the inhibitory tone on dopaminergic neurons in the nucleus accumbens and contributing to the activation of the brain's reward and addiction pathway."
622,"It can also be given with low dose ethinylestradiol for contraception as well as the treatment of moderate acne vulgaris in women ≥15 years old.Norgestimate was first described in the literature in 1977. It was developed by Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation as part of an effort to develop new hormonal contraceptives with reduced adverse effects. Norgestimate was granted FDA approval on 29 December 1989.Norgestimate is a progestin that suppresses ovulation for contraception and reduces free testosterone to treat moderate acne vulgaris. The therapeutic index is wide as overdoses are rare. These actions together result in less testosterone being available to stimulate sebaceous glands, resulting in effective treatment of some forms of acne."
623,"Carboplatin is indicated in combination with an established combination of chemotherapeutic agents for the initial treatment of advanced ovarian carcinoma. Carboplatin is also indicated for the palliative treatment of ovarian carcinoma, recurrent after prior chemotherapy.Carboplatin is an organoplatinum antineoplastic alkylating agent used in the treatment of advanced ovarian carcinoma. Early clinical studies of carboplatin were performed in 1982. Carboplatin was developed as an analog of  with reduced nephrotoxicity and vomiting. Carboplatin was granted FDA approval on 3 March 1989.Carboplatin is an organoplatinum antineoplastic alkylating agent used in the treatment of advanced ovarian carcinoma."
624,"Oral and intramuscular methylprednisolone are indicated for a number of endocrine,  rheumatic, collagen, dermatologic, allergic, ophthalmic, respiratory, hematologic, neoplastic, edematous, gastrointestinal, nervous system, and other disorders. Intra-articular and soft tissue injections are indicated for short term treatment of acute gouty arthritis, acute and subactute bursitis, acute nonspecific tenosynovitis, epicondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and synovitis of osteoarthritis. Intralesional injections are indicated for alopecia areata, discoid lupus erythematosus, keloids, lichen planus, lichen simplex chronicus and psoriatic plaques, necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum, and localized hypertrophic infiltrated inflammatory lesions of granuloma annulare.Methylprednisolone is a  derivative glucocorticoid with higher potency than . The efficacy of methylprednisolone in novel coronavirus pneumonia is being investigated further in clinical trials.Corticosteroids bind to the glucocorticoid receptor, inhibiting pro-inflammatory signals, and promoting anti-inflammatory signals. Lower doses of corticosteroids provide an anti-inflammatory effect, while higher doses are immunosuppressive."
625,"In Canada, it is also indicated in the prophylaxis of angina.Pindolol is a first generation non-selective beta blocker used in the treatment of hypertension. cAMP-dependant kinase A also phosphorylates myosin light chains, increasing smooth muscle contractility. By blocking beta-1 receptors in the juxtaglomerular apparatus, pindolol inhibits the release of renin, which inhibits angiotensin II and aldosterone release. Beta-2 adrenoceptors located in the kidneys and peripheral blood vessels use a similar mechanism to activate cAMP-dependant kinase A to increase smooth muscle contractility. Blocking of the beta-2 adrenoceptor relaxes smooth muscle, leading to vasodilation."
626,"For production of local or regional analgesia and anesthesia by local infiltration, peripheral nerve block techniques, and central neural techniques including epidural and caudal blocks.A local anesthetic that is chemically related to bupivacaine but pharmacologically related to lidocaine. Mepivicaine as a reasonably rapid onset and medium duration and is known by the proprietary names as Carbocaine and Polocaine. Mepivicaine is used in local infiltration and regional anesthesia. Systemic absorption of local anesthetics produces effects on the cardiovascular and central nervous systems. In general, the progression of anesthesia is related to the diameter, myelination, and conduction velocity of affected nerve fibers."
627,"It is known as a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic. Zaleplon interacts with the GABA receptor complex and shares some of the pharmacological properties of the benzodiazepines. Zaleplon is a schedule IV drug in the United States.Zaleplon is a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic from the pyrazolopyrimidine class and is indicated for the short-term treatment of insomnia. While Zaleplon is a hypnotic agent with a chemical structure unrelated to benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or other drugs with known hypnotic properties, it interacts with the gamma-aminobutyric acid-benzodiazepine (GABABZ) receptor complex. Subunit modulation of the GABABZ receptor chloride channel macromolecular complex is hypothesized to be responsible for some of the pharmacological properties of benzodiazepines, which include sedative, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, and anticonvulsive effects in animal models."
628,"For the treatment of postoperative inflammation in patients who have undergone cataract extraction.Bromfenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for ophthalmic use. Ophthalmic NSAIDs are becoming a cornerstone for the management of ocular pain and inflammation. Their well-characterized anti-inflammatory activity, analgesic property, and established safety record have also made NSAIDs an important tool for optimizing surgical outcomes. Non-ophthalmic formulations of bromfenac were withdrawn in the US in 1998 due to cases of severe liver toxicity.Bromfenac ophthalmic solution is a sterile, topical, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for ophthalmic use.The mechanism of its action is thought to be due to its ability to block prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting cyclooxygenase 1 and 2. Prostaglandins have been shown in many animal models to be mediators of certain kinds of intraocular inflammation."
629,"Generally, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) such as telmisartan bind to the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptors with high affinity, causing inhibition of the action of angiotensin II on vascular smooth muscle, ultimately leading to a reduction in arterial blood pressure. New studies suggest that telmisartan may also have PPAR&gamma; agonistic properties that could potentially confer beneficial metabolic effects, as PPAR&gamma; is a nuclear receptor that regulates specific gene transcription, and whose target genes are involved in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as anti-inflammatory responses. Telmisartan works by blocking the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone secretory effects of angiotensin II.Telmisartan interferes with the binding of angiotensin II to the angiotensin II AT1-receptor by binding reversibly and selectively to the receptors in vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. As angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor, which also stimulates the synthesis and release of aldosterone, blockage of its effects results in decreases in systemic vascular resistance. Studies also suggest that telmisartan is a partial agonist of PPAR&gamma;, which is an established target for antidiabetic drugs."
630,"For the relief of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis, perennial (non-seasonal) allergic rhinitis. Desloratidine is also used for the sympomatic treatment of pruritus and urticaria (hives) associated with chronic idiopathic urticaria.Desloratadine is a second generation, tricyclic antihistamine that which has a selective and peripheral H1-antagonist action. Desloratidine has a long-lasting effect and does not cause drowsiness because it does not readily enter the central nervous system.Desloratadine is a long-acting second-generation H1-receptor antagonist which has a selective and peripheral H1-antagonist action. Histamine is released from histamine-storing cells (mast cells) and attaches to other cells that have receptors for histamine. nasal congestion, watery eyes) brought on by histamine."
631,"Since then, methyldopa was largely replaced by newer, better-tolerated antihypertensive agents; Methyldopa is also available as intravenous injection, which is used to manage hypertension when oral therapy is unfeasible and to treat hypertensive crisis.Antihypertensive effects of methyldopa are mostly mediated by its pharmacologically active metabolite, alpha-methylnorepinephrine, which works as an agonist at central inhibitory alpha-adrenergic receptors. Methyldopa also reduces plasma renin activity but has negligible effects on glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow, or filtration fraction. Stimulating alpha-2 adrenergic receptors results in the inhibition of adrenergic neuronal outflow and attenuation of norepinephrine release in the brainstem. Consequently, the output of vasoconstrictor adrenergic signals to the peripheral sympathetic nervous system is reduced, leading to a reduction in blood pressure. The L-isomer of alpha-methyldopa also reduces blood pressure by inhibiting aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase, also known as DOPA decarboxylase, which is an enzyme responsible for the syntheses of dopamine and serotonin."
632,"Alosetron was voluntarily withdrawn from the US market in November 2000 by the manufacturer due to numerous reports of severe adverse effects including ischemic colitis, severely obstructed or ruptured bowel, and death. In June 2002, the FDA approved a supplemental new drug application allowing the remarketing of the drug under restricted conditions of use.Alosetron is a potent and selective antagonist of the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor type. Activation of these receptors and the resulting neuronal depolarization affects the regulation of visceral pain, colonic transit, and GI secretions processes that are related to IBS. Activation of these channels and the resulting neuronal depolarization affect the regulation of visceral pain, colonic transit and gastrointestinal secretions, processes that relate to the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). 5-HT3 receptor antagonists such as alosetron inhibit activation of non-selective cation channels which results in the modulation of serotonin-sensitive GI motor and sensory processes."
633,"For the treatment of Wilms' tumor, childhood rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma and metastatic, nonseminomatous testicular cancer as part of a combination chemotherapy and/or multi-modality treatment regimenA compound composed of a two cyclic peptides attached to a phenoxazine that is derived from streptomyces parvullus. It binds to DNA and inhibits RNA synthesis (transcription), with chain elongation more sensitive than initiation, termination, or release. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1993, p2015)Generally, the actinomycins exert an inhibitory effect on gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and on some fungi. This cytotoxic action is the basis for their use in the treatment of certain types of cancer. Dactinomycin is believed to produce its cytotoxic effects by binding DNA and inhibiting RNA synthesis.Good evidence exists that this drug bind strongly, but reversibly, to DNA, interfering with synthesis of RNA (prevention of RNA polymerase elongation) and, consequently, with protein synthesis."
634,"Intranasal azelastine is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis in patients 5 years and older and for the symptomatic treatment of vasomotor rhinitis in patients 12 years and older. As a 0.15% nasal spray, azelastine hydrochloride is also indicated for over-the-counter treatment of allergies in patients aged six years and older.Azelastine, a phthalazine derivative, is an antihistamine available as an intranasal spray for the treatment of allergic and vasomotor rhinitis and as an ophthalmic solution for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. It is a racemic mixture, though there is no noted difference in pharmacologic activity between enantiomers, and was first granted FDA approval in 1996.Azelastine antagonizes the actions of histamine, resulting in the relief of histamine-mediated allergy symptoms. Onset of action occurs within 15 minutes with intranasal formulations and as quickly as 3 minutes with ophthalmic solutions. Following allergen exposure in sensitized individuals, IgE-receptor cross-linking on mast cells results in the release of histamine, which binds to H1-receptors and contributes to typical allergic symptoms such as itching, sneezing, and congestion."
635,"In genetically NPC1L1-deficient mice, a 70% reduction in intestinal cholesterol absorption was seen, and these mice were insensitive to ezetimibe treatment - it was determined based on these findings that NPC1L1 plays an essential role in promoting intestinal cholesterol uptake via an ezetimibe-sensitive pathway. In clinical trials involving patients with homozygous and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and in those with sitosterolemia, a recommended therapeutic dose of ezetimibe was effective in reducing the LDL levels by 15-20% while increasing HDL-C by 2.5-5%. The primary target of ezetimibe is the cholesterol transport protein Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) protein. Once cholesterol in the gut lumen or bile is incorporated into the cell membrane of enterocytes, it binds to the sterol-sensing domain of NPC1L1 and forms a NPC1L1/cholesterol complex. Ezetimibe selectively blocks the NPC1L1 protein in the jejunal brush border, reducing the uptake of intestinal lumen micelles into the enterocyte."
636,"It is used in pharmaceutical manufacturing and as a food additive.Edetate calcium is a heavy metal chelating agent. The calcium in edetate calcium can be displaced by divalent or trivalent metals to form a stable water soluble complex that can be excreted in the urine. In addition to chelating lead, edetate calcium also chelates and eliminates zinc from the body. Edetate calcium also binds cadmium, copper, iron and manganese, but to a much lesser extent than either lead or zinc. A stable chelate will form with any metal that has the ability to displace calcium from the molecule, a feature shared by lead, zinc, cadmium, manganese, iron and mercury."
637,"For as an adjunct to coumarin anticoagulants in the prevention of postoperative thromboembolic complications of cardiac valve replacement and also used in prevention of angina.A phosphodiesterase inhibitor that blocks uptake and metabolism of adenosine by erythrocytes and vascular endothelial cells. Dipyridamole also potentiates the antiaggregating action of prostacyclin. Dipyridamole is also used in myocardial perfusion imaging, as an antiplatelet agent.Dipyridamole likely inhibits both adenosine deaminase and phosphodiesterase, preventing the degradation of cAMP, an inhibitor of platelet function. This elevation in cAMP blocks the release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids and reduces thromboxane A2 activity. Dipyridamole also directly stimulates the release of prostacyclin, which induces adenylate cyclase activity, thereby raising the intraplatelet concentration of cAMP and further inhibiting platelet aggregation."
638,"It is used to treat mild to moderate respiratory infections.Telithromycin is a ketolide antibiotic which has an antimicrobial spectrum similar or slightly broader than that of penicillin. Telithromycin prevents bacterial growth by binding to bacterial 50S ribosomal subunits and interfering with bacterial peptide translocation and elongation.Telithromycin acts by binding to domains II and V of 23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit. By binding at domain II, telithromycin retains activity against gram-positive cocci (e.g. Streptococcus pneumoniae) in the presence of resistance mediated by methylases (erm genes) that alter the binding site at domain V. Telithromycin may also inhibit the assembly of nascent ribosomal units. This increased binding affinity may be conferred by the C11-12 carbamate side chain of telithromycin. The  side chain appears to maintain binding at domain II in the presence of resistance mediated by alterations in domain V."
639,"Ethinylestradiol was first synthesized in 1938 by Hans Herloff Inhoffen and Walter Hohlweg at Schering. It was developed in an effort to create an estrogen with greater oral bioavailability. Ethinylestradiol soon replaced  in contraceptive pills. Ethinylestradiol was granted FDA approval on 25 June 1943.Ethinylestradiol is a synthetic estrogen that decreases luteinizing hormone to decrease endometrial vascularization, and decreases gonadotrophic hormone to prevent ovulation. It has a long duration of action as it is taken once daily, and a wide therapeutic index as overdoses are generally not associated with serious adverse effects."
640,"For the treatment of bacterial infections of the respiratory tract (chronic bronchitis) and urinary tract, and as a pre-operative prophylactic to prevent urinary tract infection caused by: S.pneumoniae, H.influenzae, S.aureus, P.aeruginosa, E. cloacae P. mirabilis, C. civersus, S. asprphyticus, E.coli, and K.pneumoniae.Lomefloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, used to treat bacterial infections including bronchitis and urinary tract infections (UTIs). They also posses effective activity against shigella, salmonella, campylobacter, gonococcal organisms, and multi drug resistant pseudomonas and enterobacter.Lomefloxacin is a bactericidal fluoroquinolone agent with activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. The bactericidal action of lomefloxacin results from interference with the activity of the bacterial enzymes DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, which are needed for the transcription and replication of bacterial DNA. DNA gyrase appears to be the primary quinolone target for gram-negative bacteria. Topoisomerase IV appears to be the preferential target in gram-positive organisms."
641,"For the treatment of glaucoma, and in the treatment of severe anticholinergic toxicity.A cholinesterase inhibitor that is rapidly absorbed through membranes. It can be applied topically to the conjunctiva. It also can cross the blood-brain barrier and is used when central nervous system effects are desired, as in the treatment of severe anticholinergic toxicity.Physostigmine is a parasympathomimetic, specifically, a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor which effectively increases the concentration of acetylcholine at the sites of cholinergic transmission. Physostigmine is used to treat glaucoma. Because it crosses the blood-brain barrier, it is also used to treat the central nervous system effects of atropine overdose and other anticholinergic drug overdoses."
642,"Formoterol is indicated in various formulations for the treatment of asthma and COPD. It is available as a single-entity product  and in several formulations in combination with both inhaled corticosteroids  and long-acting muscarinic antagonists.Formoterol works locally in the lungs as a bronchodilator, relaxing smooth muscle and opening up the airways. It possesses both a rapid onset of action (approximately 2-3 minutes) and a long duration of action (up to 12 hours). The use of long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs), such as formoterol, without concomitant inhaled corticosteroids in asthmatic patients should be avoided, as LABA monotherapy has been associated with an increased risk of asthma-related death.Formoterol is a relatively selective long-acting agonist of beta2-adrenergic receptors, although it does carry some degree of activity at beta1 and beta3 receptors. Beta2 receptors are found predominantly in bronchial smooth muscle (with a relatively minor amount found in cardiac tissue) whereas beta1 receptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors found in the heart - for this reason, selectivity for beta2 receptors is desirable in the treatment of pulmonary diseases such as COPD and asthma."
643,"For the treatment of refractory deficient red cell production anemias, breast carcinoma, hereditary angioedema, antithrombin III deficiency, fibrinogen excess, growth failure and Turner's syndrome. It is also indicated in the prophylaxis of hereditary angioedema.C18 steroid with androgenic and anabolic properties. It is a schedule III drug in the U.S.Nandrolone is an anabolic steroid occurring naturally in the human body, albeit in small quantities. Nandrolone increases production and urinary excretion of erythropoietin. Nandrolone binds to the androgen receptor to a greater degree than testosterone, but due to its inability to act on the muscle in ways unmediated by the receptor, has less overall effect on muscle growth.Nandrolone is an androgen receptor agonist."
644,"Dimenhydrinate is indicated for the prevention and treatment of nausea, vomiting, or vertigo of motion sickness.Dimehydrinate was first described in the literature in 1949, and patented in 1950. Dimenhydrinate is a combination of  and  in a salt form, with 53%-55.5% dried diphenhydramine, and 44%-47% died 8-chlorotheophylline. The antiemetic properties of dimenhydrinate are primarily thought to be produced by diphenhydramine's antagonism of H1 histamine receptors in the vestibular system while the excitatory effects are thought to be produced by 8-chlorotheophylline's adenosine receptor blockade. When used in large doses, dimenhydrinate has been shown to cause a ""high"" characterized by hallucinations, excitement, incoordination, and disorientation. Dimenhydrinate was granted FDA approval on 31 May 1972.Dimenhydrinate is indicated for the prevention and treatment of nausea, vomiting, or vertigo of motion sickness."
645,"Glycopyrronium formulated as a topical cloth is indicated to treat primary axillary hyperhidrosis in patients ≥9 years, and an inhalational solution is indicated for long term maintenance of airflow obstruction in COPD. A glycopyrronium intravenous and intramuscular injection is indicated in adults and pediatric patients to reduce the volume and acidity of gastric secretions, reduce airway secretions, and block cardiac inhibitory reflexes during the induction of anesthesia and intubation; to treat surgically-induced, drug-induced, or vagal reflex associated arrhythmias intraoperatively; and to prevent peripheral muscarinic effects of cholinergic drugs. The same injection is indicated in adults as an adjunct therapy in the treatment of peptic ulcers, as is an orally disintegrating tablet formulation. Glycopyrronium was originally granted FDA approval on 11 August 1961.Glycopyrronium is a quaternary ammonium compound that is one of the most commonly prescribed long acting muscarinic antagonists. Secretions from salivary and sweat glands, as well as gastric acid secretions, are also predominantly mediated by the M3 receptor."
646,"(From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p472)Cytarabine is an antineoplastic anti-metabolite used in the treatment of several forms of leukemia including acute myelogenous leukemia and meningeal leukemia. Anti-metabolites masquerade as purine or pyrimidine - which become the building blocks of DNA. Cytarabine is metabolized intracellularly into its active triphosphate form (cytosine arabinoside triphosphate). Cytotoxicity is highly specific for the S phase of the cell cycle.Cytarabine acts through direct DNA damage and incorporation into DNA. Although the mechanism of action is not completely understood, it appears that cytarabine acts through the inhibition of DNA polymerase."
647,"For the correction of hemodynamic imbalances present in the shock syndrome due to myocardial infarction, trauma, endotoxic septicemia, open-heart surgery, renal failure, and chronic cardiac decompensation as in congestive failureOne of the catecholamine neurotransmitters in the brain. It is a precursor to norepinephrine in noradrenergic nerves and is also a neurotransmitter in certain areas of the central nervous system, especially in the nigrostriatal tract, and in a few peripheral sympathetic nerves. Dopamine produces positive chronotropic and inotropic effects on the myocardium, resulting in increased heart rate and cardiac contractility. This is accomplished directly by exerting an agonist action on beta-adrenoceptors and indirectly by causing release of norepinephrine from storage sites in sympathetic nerve endings.Dopamine is a precursor to norepinephrine in noradrenergic nerves and is also a neurotransmitter in certain areas of the central nervous system. Dopamine produces positive chronotropic and inotropic effects on the myocardium, resulting in increased heart rate and cardiac contractility."
648,"An early pathophysiological feature of Alzheimer's disease that is associated with memory loss and cognitive deficits is a deficiency of acetylcholine as a result of selective loss of cholinergic neurons in the cerebral cortex, nucleus basalis, and hippocampus. While the precise mechanism of rivastigmine's action is unknown, it is postulated to exert its therapeutic effect by enhancing cholinergic function. This is accomplished by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine through reversible inhibition of its hydrolysis by cholinesterase. If this proposed mechanism is correct, rivastigmine's effect may lessen as the disease progresses and fewer cholinergic neurons remain functionally intact.Rivastigmine is a carbamate derivative that is structurally related to physostigmine, but not to donepezil and tacrine. The anticholinesterase activity of rivastigmine is relatively specific for brain acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase compared with those in peripheral tissues."
649,"It irreversibly binds to the active site of the enzyme resulting in permanent inhibition.Aromatase is an enzyme that converts hormones to estrogen in the body's adrenal glands. The selective AIs (SAIs) selectively reduce levels of estrogen without interfering with levels of other steroid hormones that are produced by the adrenal gland. Drugs in this class include anastrozole (Arimidex &trade;), letrozole (Femara &trade;) and exemestane (Aromasin &trade;).Breast cancer cell growth may be estrogen-dependent. Aromatase (exemestane) is the principal enzyme that converts androgens to estrogens both in pre- and postmenopausal women. Estrogen deprivation through aromatase inhibition is an effective and selective treatment for some postmenopausal patients with hormone-dependent breast cancer."
650,"Used to relieve the inflammation, swelling, stiffness, and joint pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.Oxaprozin is a non-narcotic, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), used to relieve the inflammation, swelling, stiffness, and joint pain associated with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.Oxaprozin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with analgesic and antipyretic properties. Oxaprozin is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, dysmenorrhea, and to alleviate moderate pain.Anti-inflammatory effects of Oxaprozin are believed to be due to inhibition of cylooxygenase in platelets which leads to the blockage of prostaglandin synthesis. Antipyretic effects may be due to action on the hypothalamus, resulting in an increased peripheral blood flow, vasodilation, and subsequent heat dissipation. Oxaprozin is a non-selective NSAID, with a cell assay system showing lower COX-2 selectivity implying higher COX-1 selectivity."
651,"For topical use, in combination with 570 to 670 nm wavelength red light illumination, in the treatment of non-hyperkeratotic actinic keratoses of the face and scalp in immunocompetent patients when used in conjunction with lesion preparation (debridement using a sharp dermal curette).Methyl aminolevulinate is a prodrug that is metabolised to Protoporphyrin IX (a photosensitizer) used in photodynamic therapy.After topical application of methyl aminolevulinate, porphyrins will accumulate intracellularly in the treated skin lesions. The intracellular porphyrins (including PpIX) are photoactive, fluorescing compounds and, upon light activation in the presence of oxygen, singlet oxygen is formed which causes damage to cellular compartments, in particular the mitochondria. Light activation of accumulated porphyrins leads to a photochemical reaction and thereby phototoxicity to the light-exposed target cells.Photosensitization following application of methyl aminolevulinate cream occurs through the metabolic conversion of methyl aminolevulinate (prodrug) to photoactive porphyrins (PAP), which accumulates in the skin lesions to which the cream has been applied. When exposed to light of appropriate wavelength and energy, the accumulated photoactive porphyrins produce a photodynamic reaction, resulting in a cytotoxic process dependent upon the simultaneous presence of oxygen. The absorption of light results in an excited state of porphyrin molecules, and subsequent spin transfer from photoactive porphyrins to molecular oxygen generates singlet oxygen, which can further react to form superoxide and hydroxyl radicals."
652,"Azathioprine is indicated to treat rheumatoid arthritis and prevent renal transplant rejection.Azathioprine is a prodrug of 6-mercaptopurine, first synthesized in 1956 by Gertrude Elion, William Lange, and George Hitchings in an attempt to produce a derivative of 6-mercaptopurine with a better therapeutic index. Azathiprine was granted FDA approval on 20 March 1968.Azathioprine is an immunosuppressive agent which functions through modulation of rac1 to induce T cell apoptosis, as well as other unknown immunosuppressive functions. Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of malignancies of the skin and lymphomas.Azathioprine's mechanism of action is not entirely understood but it may be related to inhibition of purine synthesis, along with inhibition of B and T cells. 6-thioguanine triphosphate, a metabolite of azathioprine, modulates activation of rac1 when costimulated with CD28, inducing T cell apoptosis. This may be mediated through rac1's action on mitogen-activated protein kinase, NF-kappaB."
653,"It is strongly recommended that oral neomycin is only used in infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria to reduce the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. The ophthalmic solution containing neomycin in combination with polymyxin B sulfates and dexamethasone is used to treat steroid-responsive inflammatory ocular conditions for which a corticosteroid is indicated and where bacterial infection or a risk of bacterial infection exists.Neomycin is a broad-spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotic drug that is derived from the metabolic products of _Streptomyces fradiae_. Neomycin is active against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms and mediates its pharmacological action by binding to bacterial ribosomes and inhibiting protein synthesis, which is crucial for the survival of bacteria. Neomycin sulfate as monotherapy is available in an oral solution for adjunct use in the treatment of hepatic coma. Neomycin has no antifungal activity and has some activity against some protozoa.Like other aminoglycoside antibiotic drugs, neomycin inhibits bacterial ribosomes by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit of susceptible bacteria and disrupting the translational machinery of bacterial protein synthesis."
654,"Used in the treatment of active, progressive or destructive forms of inflammatory arthritis, such as adult rheumatoid arthritis.Auranofin is a gold salt that is capable of eliciting pharmacologic actions that suppress inflammation and stimulate cell-mediated immunity. It has subsequently been listed by the World Health Organization as a member of the antirheumatic agent category. Heme oxygenase 1 is an inducible heme-degrading enzyme with anti-inflammatory properties.Auranofin is a gold salt used in treating inflammatory arthritis. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, gold salts such as auranofin can be administered to decrease joint inflammation and prevent the destruction of bones and cartilage. Another study showed that auranofin enhanced the production of free radicals, governing T-cell activation."
655,"In the United States, gabapentin is officially indicated for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia in adults and for the adjunctive treatment of partial-onset seizures, with or without secondary generalization, in patients 3 years of age and older. It is also used in adults for the treatment of various types of peripheral neuropathic pain, such as painful diabetic neuropathy.Gabapentin is a structural analogue of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid () that was first approved for use in the United States in 1993. It has a wide therapeutic index, with doses in excess of 8000 mg/kg failing to cause a fatal reaction in rats. Gabapentin appears to inhibit the action of α2δ-1 subunits, thus decreasing the density of pre-synaptic voltage-gated calcium channels and subsequent release of excitatory neurotransmitters. There is some evidence that gabapentin also acts on adenosine receptors and voltage-gated potassium channels, though the clinical relevance of its action at these sites is unclear."
656,"For the liposomal formulation, doxorubicin is indicated for the treatment of ovarian cancer that has progressed or recurred after platinum-based chemotherapy, AIDS-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma after the failure of prior systemic chemotherapy or intolerance to such therapy, and multiple myeloma in combination with bortezomib in patients who have not previously received bortezomib and have received at least one prior therapy.Doxorubicin is a cytotoxic anthracycline antibiotic isolated from cultures of Streptomyces peucetius var. Although its detailed molecular mechanisms have yet to be understood, doxorubicin is generally thought to exert its effect through DNA intercalation, which eventually leads to DNA damage and the generation of reactive oxygen species. It is generally thought to exert its antitumor effect by destabilizing DNA structures through intercalation, thus introducing DNA strand breakages and damages. Additionally, the doxorubicin-DNA complex can interfere with topoisomerase II enzyme activity by preventing relegation of topoisomerase-mediated DNA breaks, thus inhibiting replication and transcription and inducing apoptosis. Moreover, doxorubicin can be metabolized by microsomal NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase into a semiquinone radical, which can be reoxidized in the presence of oxygen to form oxygen radicals."
657,"Frovatriptan is a triptan drug developed by Vernalis for the treatment of migraine headaches, in particular those associated with menstruation. Frovatriptan causes vasoconstriction of arteries and veins that supply blood to the head. It is structurally distinct from, but pharmacologically related to other selective 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonists. Frovatriptan has no significant effects on GABAA mediated channel activity and has no significant affinity for benzodiazepine binding sites. Frovatriptan eases the pain associated with migraine by narrowing these blood vessels."
658,"Hydrochlorothiazide is indicated alone or in combination for the management of edema associated with congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, acute glomerulonephritis, chronic renal failure, and corticosteroid and estrogen therapy. It is indicated to treat edema and hypertension. Hydrochlorothiazide use is common but declining in favour of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Hydrochlorothiazide was granted FDA approval on 12 February 1959.Hydrochlorothiazide prevents the reabsorption of sodium and water from the distal convoluted tubule, allowing for the increased elimination of water in the urine. Normally, sodium is reabsorbed into epithelial cells of the distal convoluted tubule and pumped into the basolateral interstitium by a sodium-potassium ATPase, creating a concentration gradient between the epithelial cell and the distal convoluted tubule that promotes the reabsorption of water."
659,"For the treatment of bacterial infections caused by susceptible organisms.A cyclohexylamido analog of penicillanic acid.Cyclacillin, a penicillin, is a cyclohexylamido analog of penicillanic acid. Cyclacillin is more resistant to beta-lactamase hydrolysis than ampicillin, is much better absorbed when given by mouth and, as a result, the levels reached in the blood and in the urine are considerably higher than those obtained with the same dose of ampicillin. Cyclacillin has been replaced by newer penicillin treatments.The bactericidal activity of cyclacillin results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Cyclacillin is stable in the presence of a variety of b-lactamases, including penicillinases and some cephalosporinases."
660,"It is 29 times more selective for beta2 receptors than beta1 receptors giving it higher specificity for pulmonary beta receptors versus beta1-adrenergic receptors located in the heart. It is also used prophylactically for exercise-induced asthma.Salbutamol (INN) or albuterol (USAN), a moderately selective beta(2)-receptor agonist similar in structure to terbutaline, is widely used as a bronchodilator to manage asthma and other chronic obstructive airway diseases. Metabolic effects such as hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia also may occur, although it is not known whether these effects are mediated by beta-1 or beta-2 receptors. Increased cyclic AMP concentrations are also associated with the inhibition of release of mediators from mast cells in the airway. Salbutamol has been shown in most controlled clinical trials to have more effect on the respiratory tract, in the form of bronchial smooth muscle relaxation, than isoproterenol at comparable doses while producing fewer cardiovascular effects."
661,"It is the S-enantiomer of bupivacaine. Levobupivacaine hydrochloride is commonly marketed by AstraZeneca under the trade name Chirocaine. In particular, the specific levobupivacaine enantiomer is a worthwhile pursuit because it demonstrates less vasodilation and possesses a greater length of action in comparison to bupivacaine. When administered appropriately, the occurrence of adverse effects is not anticipated much if at all. Regardless, allergic reactions may also occur - although only rarely.Levobupivacaine, a local anesthetic agent, is indicated for the production of local or regional anesthesia or analgesia for surgery, for oral surgery procedures, for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, and for obstetrical procedures.Local anesthetics such as Levobupivacaine block the generation and the conduction of nerve impulses, presumably by increasing the threshold for electrical excitation in the nerve, by slowing the propagation of the nerve impulse, and by reducing the rate of rise of the action potential."
662,"Also used in the treatment of severe cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease, including CMV pneumonia, CMV gastrointestinal disease, and disseminated CMV infections, in immunocompromised patients.An acyclovir analog that is a potent inhibitor of the Herpesvirus family including cytomegalovirus. Sensitive human viruses include cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus -1 and -2 (HSV-1, HSV-2), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV), however clinical studies have been limited to assessment of efficacy in patients with CMV infection. It inhibits virus replication by its encorporation into viral DNA. TK catalyzes phosphorylation of ganciclovir to the monophosphate, which is then subsequently converted into the diphosphate by cellular guanylate kinase and into the triphosphate by a number of cellular enzymes. When used as a substrate for viral DNA polymerase, ganciclovir triphosphate competitively inhibits dATP leading to the formation of 'faulty' DNA."
663,"Hydroxyurea is indicated to reduce the frequency of painful crises and to reduce the need for blood transfusions in adult and pediatric patients, 2 years of age and older, with sickle cell anemia with recurrent moderate to severe painful crises.Hydroxyurea is a non-alkylating antineoplastic agent that was first synthesized in 1869 but was not characterized biologically until 1928. It was first approved by the FDA in 1998 for the treatment of sickle cell anemia in adults. Although clinical evidence on the efficacy of hydroxyurea in certain conditions exists, hydroxyurea is used sparingly in clinical settings, largely due to lack of knowledge and adherence, the need for therapeutic monitoring, and serious side effects of secondary cancer and birth defects.The correlation between hydroxyurea concentrations, reduction of crisis rate, and increase in HbF, is not known.The precise mechanism by which hydroxyurea produces its antineoplastic effects cannot, at present, be described. In vitro studies utilizing Chinese hamster cells suggest that hydroxyurea is lethal to normally radioresistant S-stage cells and holds other cells of the cell cycle in the G1 or pre-DNA synthesis stage where they are most susceptible to the effects of irradiation. The third mechanism of action has been theorized on the basis of in vitro studies of HeLa cells: it appears that hydroxyurea, by inhibition of DNA synthesis, hinders the normal repair process of cells damaged but not killed by irradiation, thereby decreasing their survival rate; there is no alteration of RNA and protein syntheses."
664,"Letrozole is indicated to treat postmenopausal women with hormone receptor (HR) positive early breast cancer, postmenopausal women with early breast cancer who have periviously been treated with tamoxifen, and postmenopausal women with HR+ or unknown advanced breast cancer.Letrozole, or CGS 20267, is an oral non-steroidal type II aromatase inhibitor first described in the literature in 1990. It is a third generation aromatase inhibitor like  and , meaning it does not significantly affect cortisol, aldosterone, and thyroxine. As breast tissue is stimulated by estrogens, decreasing their production is a way of suppressing recurrence of the breast tumor tissue. Letrozole is a third generation type II aromatase inhibitor used to treat estrogen dependant breast cancers. This competitive inhibition prevents the conversion of androgens to estrogen."
665,"For the local treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (moniliasis). Tioconazole is an imidazole antifungal used to treat fungal and yeast infections. Topical formulations are used for ringworm, jock itch, athlete’s foot, and tinea versicolor or “sun fungus”. Tioconazole interacts with 14-alpha demethylase, a cytochrome P-450 enzyme that converts lanosterol to ergosterol, an essential component of the yeast membrane. In this way, tioconazole inhibits ergosterol synthesis, resulting in increased cellular permeability."
666,"It is also used as a component of pretransplant conditioning regimens in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation for acute myeloid leukemia and nonmalignant diseases.Busulfan is a bifunctional alkylating agent, having a selective immunosuppressive effect on bone marrow. It is not a structural analog of the nitrogen mustards. Alkylating agents are so named because of their ability to add alkyl groups to many electronegative groups under conditions present in cells. Busulfan is an alkylating agent that contains 2 labile methanesulfonate groups attached to opposite ends of a 4-carbon alkyl chain. These carbonium ions alkylate DNA, which results in the interference of DNA replication and RNA transcription, ultimately leading to the disruption of nucleic acid function."
667,"Ketoprofen has pharmacologic actions similar to those of other prototypical NSAIDs, which inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. Ketoprofen is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, dysmenorrhea, and alleviate moderate pain.The anti-inflammatory effects of ketoprofen are believed to be due to inhibition cylooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an enzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis via the arachidonic acid pathway. This results in decreased levels of prostaglandins that mediate pain, fever and inflammation. Ketoprofen is a non-specific cyclooxygenase inhibitor and inhibition of COX-1 is thought to confer some of its side effects, such as GI upset and ulceration. Ketoprofen is thought to have anti-bradykinin activity, as well as lysosomal membrane-stabilizing action."
668,"It is used as a test of the feedback hypothalamic-pituitary mechanism in the diagnosis of cushing syndrome.Metopirone is an inhibitor of endogenous adrenal corticosteroid synthesis.The pharmacological effect of Metopirone is to reduce cortisol and corticosterone production by inhibiting the 11-&szlig;-hydroxylation reaction in the adrenal cortex. Removal of the strong inhibitory feedback mechanism exerted by cortisol results in an increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) production by the pituitary. With continued blockade of the enzymatic steps leading to production of cortisol and corticosterone, there is a marked increase in adrenocortical secretion of their immediate precursors, 11-desoxycortisol and desoxycorticosterone, which are weak suppressors of ACTH release, and a corresponding elevation of these steroids in the plasma and of their metabolites in the urine. Because of these actions, metopirone is used as a diagnostic test, with urinary 17-OHCS measured as an index of pituitary ACTH responsiveness. Metopirone may also suppress biosynthesis of aldosterone, resulting in a mild natriuresis."
669,"For the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease who are on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Also for the treatment of hypercalcemia in patients with parathyroid carcinoma.Cinacalcet is a calcimimetic sold by Amgen under the trade name Sensipar® in North America and Australia and as Mimpara® in Europe. Secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive disease, associated with increases in parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels and derangements in calcium and phosphorus metabolism. The goals of treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism are to lower levels of PTH, calcium, and phosphorus in the blood, in order to prevent progressive bone disease and the systemic consequences of disordered mineral metabolism. In CKD patients on dialysis with uncontrolled secondary HPT, reductions in PTH are associated with a favorable impact on bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP), bone turnover and bone fibrosis."
670,"Clobetasol propionate is indicated to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis as well as inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid responsive dermatoses.Clobetasol propionate is a prednisolone derivative with higher specificity for glucocorticoid receptors than mineralocorticoid receptors. It has demonstrated superior activity compared to  and was first described in the literature in 1974. Clobetasol Propionate was granted FDA approval on 27 December 1985.Corticosteroids bind to the glucocorticoid receptor, inhibiting pro-inflammatory signals, and promoting anti-inflammatory signals. Clobetasol propionate is generally applied twice daily so the duration of action is long. Lower doses of corticosteroids provide an anti-inflammatory effect, while higher doses are immunosuppressive."
671,"It is sold under the name ""Colazal"" in the US and ""Colazide"" in the UK. The chemical name is (E)-5- phenyl]azo] -2-hydroxybenzoic acid. It is usually administered as the disodium salt. Mesalazine is also known as 5-aminosalicylic acid, or 5-ASA.Balsalazide is a prodrug that has little or no pharmacologic activity until it is enzymatically cleaved in the colon to produce mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid), an anti inflammatory drug indicated for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways (catalyzes the formation of prostaglandin precursors from arachidonic acid), and through the lipoxygenase pathways (catalyzes the formation of leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids from arachidonic acid and its metabolites), is increased in patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease."
672,"In Canada, additional indications include the adjunctive treatment of cholera, treatment of bacillary dysentery, nocardiosis, and second-line treatment of brucellosis in combination with  or .Sulfamethoxazole is a bacteriostatic sulfonamide antibiotic that interferes with folic acid synthesis in susceptible bacteria. In this combination, sulfamethoxazole is useful for the treatment of a variety of bacterial infections, including those of the urinary, respiratory, and gastrointestinal tracts.Sulfamethoxazole is a bacteriostatic sulfonamide antibiotic that inhibits a critical step in bacterial folate synthesis. Studies have shown that bacterial resistance develops more slowly with the combination of the two drugs than with either trimethoprim or sulfamethoxazole alone, as together they inhibit sequential steps in the bacterial folate synthesis pathway. Sulfamethoxazole treatment may contribute to folate deficiency and should therefore be used with caution in patients at a higher risk of developing a deficiency. Hemolysis has been observed in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency who are using sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim.Sulfamethoxazole is a sulfonamide that inhibits bacterial dihydrofolic acid synthesis due to its structural similarity to an endogenous substrate, para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)."
673,"Glyburide stimulates insulin secretion through the closure of ATP-sensitive potassium channels on beta cells, raising intracellular potassium and calcium ion concentrations. A formulation with metformin was granted FDA approval on on 31 July 2000.Glyburide is a second generation sulfonylurea that stimulates insulin secretion through the closure of ATP-sensitive potassium channels on beta cells, raising intracellular potassium and calcium ion concentrations. Glibenclamide has a long duration of action as it is given once daily, and a wide therapeutic index as patients are started at doses as low as 0.75mg but that can increase as high as 10mg or more. The ATP-sensitive potassium channels on beta cells are known as sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1). Normally SUR1 closes in response to high glucose concentrations, the membrane potential of the cells becomes less negative, the cell depolarizes, voltage gated calcium channels open, calcium ions enter the cell, and the increased intracellular calcium concentration stimulates the release of insulin containing granules."
674,"Oral and intravenous formulations are indicated to treat infections of susceptible microorganisms. These include rickettsiae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Chlamydophila psittaci, Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Borrelia recurrentis, Haemophilus ducreyi, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, Vibrio cholerae, Campylobacter fetus, Brucella species, Bartonella bacilliformis, Klebsiella granulomatis, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Shigella species, Acinetobacter species, Haemophilus influenzae, and Kelbsiella species.Minocycline was first described in the literacture in 1966. It is a second generation tetracycline antibiotic that is active against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. Like other semisynthetic tetracyclines, minocycline has modifications to carbons 7-9 on the D ring to generate higher efficacy than previous tetracyclines. Minocycline was granted FDA approval on 30 June 1971.Minocycline is a tetracycline antibiotic that binds to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit and interferes with protein synthesis."
675,"Guanfacine is indicated alone or as an adjunct with stimulants to treat ADHD.Guanfacine, or BS 100-141, is a selective alpha-A2 adrenergic receptor agonist initially indicated for the treatment of hypertension but is now indicated as an extended release tablet for the treatment of ADHD. Guanfacine was granted FDA approval on 27 October 1986.Guanfacine is a selective alpha-2A adrenergic receptor agonist but it is unclear how this translates to the treatment of ADHD. It has a long duration of action as it is given once daily and a wide therapeutic window as fatal overdoses have not been described in literature. Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope.Guanfacine is a selective alpha-2A adrenergic receptor agonist, which reduces the effects of the sympathetic nervous system on the heart and circulatory system. The link between guanfacine’s molecular mechanism and it’s effect on the treatment of ADHD has not been determined."
676,"Like other organic nitrates, isosorbide mononitrate acts as a prodrug for its active metabolite, , which mediates the therapeutic action of isosorbide mononitrate. The extended-release forms of the drug are also available generically and under the brand name Imdur.Isosorbide mononitrate is an anti-anginal agent and vasodilator that relaxes vascular smooth muscle to prevent and manage angina pectoris. Nitric oxide works on both arteries and veins, but predominantly veins: by relaxing veins and reducing the central venous pressure, nitric oxide causes venous pooling and a decrease in the venous return to the heart, thus decreasing cardiac preload. Reduced cardiac preload and afterload caused by nitric oxide causes a reduction in myocardial oxygen consumption; decreased myocardial oxygen demand, along with increased coronary blood flow, leads to an increased in the oxygen content of coronary sinus blood  and the relief from ischemia. The duration of anti-anginal action of at least 12 hours was observed with an asymmetrical dosing regimen.Isosorbide mononitrate acts as a prodrug for nitric oxide (NO), which is a potent vasodilator gas that is released when the drug is metabolized."
677,"Used in the treatment of oedema (including that associated with heart failure) and hypertension.A thiazide diuretic with properties similar to those of hydrochlorothiazide. Thiazides also cause loss of potassium and an increase in serum uric acid. As a diuretic, Trichloromethiazide inhibits active chloride reabsorption at the early distal tubule via the Na-Cl cotransporter, resulting in an increase in the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water. Thiazides like Trichloromethiazide also inhibit sodium ion transport across the renal tubular epithelium through binding to the thiazide sensitive sodium-chloride transporter. The antihypertensive mechanism of Trichloromethiazide is less well understood although it may be mediated through its action on carbonic anhydrases in the smooth muscle or through its action on the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (KCa) channel, also found in the smooth muscle."
678,"Parenteral (intravenous, intramuscular, and subcutaneous) phylloquinone is indicated to treat coagulation disorders due to faulty formation of coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X caused by vitamin K deficiency or some interference with vitamin K activity. These indications include the above indications as well as hypoprothrombinemia secondary to sprue, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, intestinal resection, pancreatic cystic fibrosis, or regional enteritis; or hypoprothrombinemia caused by interference with vitamin k metabolism.Vitamin K1, also called phylloquinone or phytonadione, is a fat soluble vitamin. Phylloquinone is a cofactor of the enzyme γ-carboxylase, which modifies and activates precursors to coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X. Patients should have their prothrombin time monitored during therapy and healthcare professionals should be aware of the increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions with parenteral administration.Vitamin K is a cofactor of gamma-carboxylase. Binding of calcium ions converts these clotting factors to their active form, which are then secreted from hepatocytes into the blood, restoring normal clotting function."
679,"It acts primarily on vascular smooth muscle cells by stabilizing voltage-gated L-type calcium channels in their inactive conformation. In addition to binding to L-type calcium channels, felodipine binds to a number of calcium-binding proteins, exhibits competitive antagonism of the mineralcorticoid receptor, inhibits the activity of calmodulin-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, and blocks calcium influx through voltage-gated T-type calcium channels. Felodipine is used to treat mild to moderate essential hypertension.Felodipine belongs to the dihydropyridine (DHP) class of calcium channel blockers (CCBs), the most widely used class of CCBs. Felodipine also binds to calmodulin and inhibits calmodulin-dependent calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Felodipine is able to bind to skeletal and cardiac muscle isoforms of troponin C, one of the key regulatory proteins in muscle contraction."
680,"In Europe, it is also used in the treatment of endogenous Cushing's syndrome.Ketoconazole is an imidazole antifungal agent used in the prevention and treatment of a variety of fungal infections. It functions by preventing the synthesis of ergosterol, the fungal equivalent of cholesterol, thereby increasing membrane fluidity and preventing growth of the fungus. Ketoconazole was first approved in an oral formulation for systemic use by the FDA in 1981. At this time it was considered a significant improvement over previous antifungals,  and , due to its broad spectrum and good absorption. This results in inhibition of ergosterol synthesis and increased fungal cellular permeability due to reduced amounts of ergosterol present in the fungal cell membrane."
681,"If so employed, it should be administered with nitrous oxide to achieve a relatively light level of anesthesia, and a neuromuscular blocking agent given concurrently to obtain the desired degree of muscular relaxation. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1994, p180)    In the US, methoxyflurane is one of the products that have been withdrawn or removed from the market for reasons of safety or effectiveness.Methoxyflurane is a general inhalation anesthetic used for induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. It induces muscle relaxation and reduces pains sensitivity by altering tissue excitability. It does so by decreasing the extent of gap junction mediated cell-cell coupling and altering the activity of the channels that underlie the action potential.Methoxyflurane induces a reduction in junctional conductance by decreasing gap junction channel opening times and increasing gap junction channel closing times. Methoxyflurane also activates calcium dependent ATPase in the sarcoplasmic reticulum by increasing the fluidity of the lipid membrane."
682,"A combination product with hydrochlorothiazide is indicated for hypertension in patients with uncontrolled hypertension with monotherapy or first line in patients not expected to be well controlled with monotherapy.Irbesartan is an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) indicated to treat hypertension or diabetic nephropathy. Unlike angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, ARBs are not associated with a dry cough. It has a long duration of action as it is usually taken once daily and a wide therapeutic index as doses may be as low as 150mg daily but doses of 900mg/day were well tolerated in healthy human subjects.Irbesartan prevents angiotensin II binding to the AT1 receptor in tissues like vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Irbesartan’s prevention of angiotensin II binding causes vascular smooth muscle relaxation and prevents the secretion of aldosterone, lowering blood pressure. Angiotensin II would otherwise bind to the AT1 receptor, inducing vasoconstriction and aldosterone secretion, raising blood pressure."
683,"Also used as a second-line therapy for treatment-sensitive small cell lung cancer, as well as in combination with cisplatin for the treatment of stage IV-B, recurrent, or persistent cervical cancer not amenable to curative treatment with surgery and/or radiation therapy.An antineoplastic agent used to treat ovarian cancer. During these processes, DNA topoisomerase I creates reversible single-stranded breaks in double-stranded DNA, allowing intact single DNA strands to pass through the break and relieve the topologic constraints inherent in supercoiled DNA. Topotecan interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Unlike irinotecan, topotecan is found predominantly in the inactive carboxylate form at neutral pH and it is not a prodrug.Topotecan has the same mechanism of action as irinotecan and is believed to exert its cytotoxic effects during the S-phase of DNA synthesis. Topotecan binds to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevents religation of these single strand breaks."
684,"It inhibits the renal excretion of organic anions and reduces tubular reabsorption of urate. Probenecid has also been used to treat patients with renal impairment, and, because it reduces the renal tubular excretion of other drugs, has been used as an adjunct to antibacterial therapy.Probenecid is a uricosuric and renal tubular blocking agent and is used in combination with colchicine to treat chronic gouty arthritis when complicated by frequent, recurrent acute attacks of gout. It inhibits the reabsorption of urate at the proximal convoluted tubule, thus increasing the urinary excretion of uric acid and decreasing serum urate levels. This results in an increase in the plasma concentrations of acidic drugs eliminated principally by renal secretion, but only a slight increase if the drug is eliminated mainly by filtration. The mechanism by which probenecid inhibits renal tubular transport is not known, but the drug may inhibit transport enzymes that require a source of high energy phosphate bonds and/or nonspecifically interfere with substrate access to protein receptor sites on the kidney tubules."
685,"It interferes with nucleic acid synthesis by inhibiting purine metabolism and is used, usually in combination with other drugs, in the treatment of or in remission maintenance programs for leukemia.Mercaptopurine is one of a large series of purine analogues which interfere with nucleic acid biosynthesis and has been found active against human leukemias. It is an analogue of the purine bases adenine and hypoxanthine. It is not known exactly which of any one or more of the biochemical effects of mercaptopurine and its metabolites are directly or predominantly responsible for cell death.Mercaptopurine competes with hypoxanthine and guanine for the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRTase) and is itself converted to thioinosinic acid (TIMP). Upon methylation, TIMP forms 6-methylthioinosinate (MTIMP) which inhibits glutamine-5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase in addition to TIMP. In comparison, some mercaptopurine may be converted to nucleotide derivatives of 6-thioguanine (6-TG) via actions of inosinate (IMP) dehydrogenase and xanthylate (XMP) aminase that convert TIMP to thioguanylic acid (TGMP)."
686,"For the treatment of overactive bladder (with symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, or urge incontinence).Tolterodine is an antimuscarinic drug that is used to treat urinary incontinence. Both urinary bladder contraction and salivation are mediated via cholinergic muscarinic receptors. After oral administration, tolterodine is metabolized in the liver, resulting in the formation of the 5-hydroxymethyl derivative, a major pharmacologically active metabolite. Tolterodine has a pronounced effect on bladder function. The main effects of tolterodine are an increase in residual urine, reflecting an incomplete emptying of the bladder, and a decrease in detrusor pressure, consistent with an antimuscarinic action on the lower urinary tract.Both tolterodine and its active metabolite, 5-hydroxymethyltolterodine, act as competitive antagonists at muscarinic receptors."
687,"It is used in newly diagnosed patients with Parkinson's disease. It also may be given with levodopa upon onset of disability. It is the premature degradation of dopamine that results in the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Selegiline can prolong the effects of dopamine in the brain by preventing its breakdown through seletively blocking MAO-B. At higher doses, selegiline can also inhibit monozmine oxidase type A (MAO-A), allowing it to be used for the treatment of depression."
688,"Fenofibrate is also indicated to treat adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia.Fenofibrate is a fibric acid derivative like  and . Fenofibrate was granted FDA approval on 31 December 1993.Fenofibrate is a fibrate that activates peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARα) to alter lipid metabolism and treat primary hypercholesterolemia, mixed dyslipidemia, and severe hypertriglyceridemia. Fenofibrate requires once daily dosing and has a half life of 19-27 hours so its duration of action is long. Fenofibrate capsules are given at a dose of 50-150mg daily so the therapeutic index is wide. This mechanism of increased lipid metabolism is also associated with increased oxidative stress on the liver."
689,"Thalidomide is primarily used for the acute treatment and maintenance therapy to prevent and suppress the cutaneous manifestations of moderate to severe erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). A piperidinyl isoindole originally introduced as a non-barbiturate hypnotic, thalidomide was withdrawn from the market due to teratogenic effects. It has been reintroduced and used for a number of inflammatory disorders and cancers. Thalidomide can inhibit the expression myeloid differentiating factor 88 (MyD88), an adaptor protein that is involved in the TNF-alpha production signalling pathway, at the protein and RNA level. Finally, some evidences suggest that thalidomide can block alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AGP), a known inducer of the NF-kB/MyD88 pathway, thus inhibiting the expression of TNF-alpha ."
690,"Melphalan is indicated for use as a high-dose conditioning treatment prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with multiple myeloma. Melphalan is a component of HEPZATO KIT, a liver-directed therapy indicated for the treatment of adults with uveal melanoma with unresectable hepatic metastases affecting less than 50% of the liver and no extrahepatic disease or extrahepatic disease limited to the bone, lymph nodes, subcutaneous tissues, or lung that is amenable to resection or radiation.Melphalan is a nitrogen mustard or bischloroethylamine type alkylating agent. It was first synthesized in the early 1950s by substituting L-phenylalanine for the methyl group on nitrogen mustard. Melphalan is used in the treatment of multiple myeloma and ovarian carcinoma. Melphalan is cytotoxic in resting and rapidly dividing tumour cells."
691,"A more recent systemic review and meta-analysis  indicates that memantine is beneficial as a first line drug for the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia. Cholinesterase inhibitors may be added to memantine for further beneficial effects on behavioral symptoms and other symptoms of dementia .Initially approved by the FDA in 2013, memantine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist used in the management of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). In 2010, it was estimated that 36 million people worldwide live with Alzheimer's Disease. In 2013, this number increased to 44 million. The pharmacological effect of memantine likely occurs via the drug's behavior as an uncompetitive (open-channel) NMDA receptor antagonist, preventing glutamate action on this receptor."
692,"For the treatment of bronchitis, sinusitis, community-acquired pneumonia, and skin infections (abscesses, wounds) caused by S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus, M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, L. pneumophila, S. pyogenesGatifloxacin is an antibiotic agent and a member of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolone family. It is also available as eye drops under the brand name Zymar® marketed by Allergan. is bactericidal and its mode of action depends on blocking of bacterial DNA replication by binding itself to an enzyme called DNA gyrase, which allows the untwisting required to replicate one DNA double helix into two. Notably the drug has 100 times higher affinity for bacterial DNA gyrase than for mammalian. It should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria.The bactericidal action of Gatifloxacin results from inhibition of the enzymes topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV, which are required for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination."
693,"Rifampin is indicated for the treatment of tuberculosis and tuberculosis-related mycobacterial infections.A semisynthetic antibiotic produced from Streptomyces mediterranei. In susceptible organisms it inhibits DNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity by forming a stable complex with the enzyme. It is bactericidal and has a very broad spectrum of activity against most gram-positive and gram-negative organisms (including Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and specifically Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Rifampin is well absorbed when taken orally and is distributed widely in body tissues and fluids, including the CSF. It is metabolized in the liver and eliminated in bile and, to a much lesser extent, in urine, but dose adjustments are unnecessary with renal insufficiency.Rifampin acts via the inhibition of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, leading to a suppression of RNA synthesis and cell death."
694,"Lubiprostone is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic idiopathic constipation, or opioid-induced constipation in patients with chronic non-cancer pain. One approach to the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation is the secretion of fluid into the abdominal lumen through the activation of chloride channels in the apical membrane of the gastrointestinal epithelium. Lubiprostone is a locally acting chloride channel activator that increases intestinal chloride and fluid secretion without altering sodium and potassium concentrations in the serum.Lubiprostone acts by specifically activating ClC-2 chloride channels, which is a normal constituent of the apical membrane of the human intestine, in a protein kinase A action independent fashion. As a result, water follows sodium into the lumen in order to maintain isotonic equilibrium, thereby increasing intestinal fluid secretion. By increasing intestinal fluid secretion, lubiprostone increases motility in the intestine, thereby increasing the passage of stool and alleviating symptoms associated with chronic idiopathic constipation."
695,"Fluocinonide is a potent glucocorticoid steroid used topically as anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment of skin disorders such as eczema. After binding the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Like other glucocorticoid agents Fluocinolone acetonide acts as a physiological antagonist to insulin by decreasing glycogenesis (formation of glycogen). There is also decreased glycogen formation in the liver."
696,"In vivo, abacavir sulfate dissociates to its free base, abacavir.Abacavir is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) with activity against Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1). Abacavir is phosphorylated to active metabolites that compete for incorporation into viral DNA. Abacavir is a carbocyclic synthetic nucleoside analogue and an antiviral agent. Intracellularly, abacavir is converted by cellular enzymes to the active metabolite carbovir triphosphate, an analogue of deoxyguanosine-5'-triphosphate (dGTP). Carbovir triphosphate inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) both by competing with the natural substrate dGTP and by its incorporation into viral DNA."
697,"It was labeled by the FDA for the treatment of symptoms of an idiopathic decline in the mental capacity not related to a potentially reversible condition as well as for age-related cognitive impairment. The prescription of this drug is conditioned to the corroboration that the patient is not suffering from a potentially reversible and treatable condition especially delirium and dementiform illness secondary to systemic disease, primary neurological disease or primary mood disturbance. To know more about the individual components of the ergoloid mixture, please visit  and Ergoloid Mesylate is an equiproportional preparation of three different ergotamantriones: dihydroergocornine, dihydroergocristine, and dihydroergocryptine. The derivatives of this fungus are identified to be about 350 different substances from which the components of the ergoloid mesylate mixture are composed of the dihydrogenated ergot alkaloid derivatives. Its action produces a damper in the impulses from the vasomotor center which reduces the vascular tone which translates in the slow of pulse rate, prevention of compensatory tachycardia."
698,"* Dental pain - ibuprofen is used to manage acute and chronic orofacial pain. * Pain - ibuprofen is widely used to reduce minor aches and pains as well as to reduce fever and manage dysmenorrhea. * Investigational uses - efforts have been put into developing ibuprofen for the prophylaxis of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson disease, and breast cancer.Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) derived from propionic acid and it is considered the first of the propionics. The main effects reported in ibuprofen are related to the control of pain, fever and acute inflammation by the inhibition of the synthesis of prostanoids by COX-1 and COX-2. This effect is thought to be related to the effect on platelet activation and thromboxane A2 production which produces local vascular effects in the affected regions."
699,"For use in the treatment of severe infections caused by penicillin G-susceptible microorganisms when rapid and high penicillin levels are required such as in the treatment of septicemia, meningitis, pericarditis, endocarditis and severe pneumonia.Benzylpenicillin (Penicillin G) is narrow spectrum antibiotic used to treat infections caused by susceptible bacteria. Penicillin G may also be used in some cases as prophylaxis against susceptible organisms. Natural penicillins are considered the drugs of choice for several infections caused by susceptible gram positive aerobic organisms, such as *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, groups A, B, C and G streptococci, nonenterococcal group D streptococci, viridans group streptococci, and non-penicillinase producing staphylococcus. They are not generally used to treat anaerobic infections. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that penicillin G interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."
700,"For the treatment of mild to moderate hypertensionNitrendipine is a calcium channel blocker with marked vasodilator action. It is an effective antihypertensive agent and differs from other calcium channel blockers in that it does not reduce glomerular filtration rate and is mildly natriuretic, rather than sodium retentive.Nitrendipine, a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker, is used alone or with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, to treat hypertension, chronic stable angina pectoris, and Prinzmetal's variant angina. Nitrendipine is similar to other peripheral vasodilators. Nitrendipine inhibits the influx of extra cellular calcium across the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes possibly by deforming the channel, inhibiting ion-control gating mechanisms, and/or interfering with the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The decrease in intracellular calcium inhibits the contractile processes of the myocardial smooth muscle cells, causing dilation of the coronary and systemic arteries, increased oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue, decreased total peripheral resistance, decreased systemic blood pressure, and decreased afterload.By deforming the channel, inhibiting ion-control gating mechanisms, and/or interfering with the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, Nitrendipine inhibits the influx of extracellular calcium across the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes The decrease in intracellular calcium inhibits the contractile processes of the myocardial smooth muscle cells, causing dilation of the coronary and systemic arteries, increased oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue, decreased total peripheral resistance, decreased systemic blood pressure, and decreased afterload."
701,"For the treatment of documented ventricular arrhythmias, such as sustained ventricular tachycardia, that, in the judgment of the physician, are life-threatening.An antiarrhythmic agent which exerts a potential- and frequency-dependent block of sodium channels.Tocainide is a primary amine analog of lidocaine with antiarrhythmic properties useful in the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias. Tocainide, like lidocaine, produces dose dependent decreases in sodium and potassium conductance, thereby decreasing the excitability of myocardial cells. In experimental animal models, the dose-related depression of sodium current is more pronounced in ischemic tissue than in normal tissue. Tocainide is a Class I antiarrhythmic compound with electrophysiologic properties in man similar to those of lidocaine, but dissimilar from quinidine, procainamide, and disopyramide.Tocainide acts on sodium channels on the neuronal cell membrane, limiting the spread of seizure activity and reducing seizure propagation. Tocainide binds preferentially to the inactive state of the sodium channels.The antiarrhythmic actions are mediated through effects on sodium channels in Purkinje fibers."
702,"For use in the treatment of subacute or chronic angle-closure glaucoma after iridectomy or where surgery is refused or contraindicated.A potent, long-acting irreversible cholinesterase inhibitor used as an ocular hypertensive in the treatment of glaucoma. Occasionally used for accomodative esotropia.Echothiophate Iodide is a potent, long-acting cholinesterase inhibitor used as a miotic in the treatment of glaucoma. Echothiophate iodide will depress both plasma and erythrocyte cholinesterase levels in most patients after a few weeks of eyedrop therapy.Echothiophate Iodide is a long-acting cholinesterase inhibitor for topical use which enhances the effect of endogenously liberated acetylcholine in iris, ciliary muscle, and other parasympathetically innervated structures of the eye. Echothiophate iodide binds irreversibly to cholinesterase, and is long acting due to the slow rate of hydrolysis by cholinesterase. It causes miosis, increase in facility of outflow of aqueous humor, fall in intraocular pressure, and potentiation of accommodation."
703,"Praziquantel is indicated in patients aged 1 year and older for the treatment of the schistosomiasis due to all species of Schistosoma (for example, Schistosoma mekongi, Schistosoma japonicum, Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma hematobium) and clonorchiasis and opisthorchiasis due to the liver flukes, Clonorchis sinensis/Opisthorchis viverrini (approval of this indication was based on studies in which the two species were not differentiated).Praziquantel is a pyrazino-isoquinolein derivative from the thioxantonic group used as a broad anthelmintic spectrum. Despite being approved since 1980, the exact mechanism of action is yet to be elucidated.In vitro studies on trematodes and cestodes have shown that praziquantel induces a rapid contraction of schistosomas by a specific effect on the permeability of the cell membrane. Praziquantel is active against schistosoma (for example, Schistosoma mekongi, Schistosoma japonicum, Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma hematobium), and infections due to the liver flukes, Clonorchis sinensis/Opisthorchis viverrini. An interesting quirk of praziquantel is that it is relatively ineffective against juvenile schistosomes. Effectiveness then increases again until it is once again fully effective at 6-7 weeks.Although the exact mechanism of action is unknown, praziquantel was hypothesized to target the β subunits of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, particularly in Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma japonicum, due to the lack of two conserved serine residues in these subunits."
704,"For the treatment of urinary tract infectionA synthetic fluoroquinolone (fluoroquinolones) with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against most gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. Norfloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase.Norfloxacin is a quinolone/fluoroquinolone antibiotic. Norfloxacin is bactericidal and its mode of action depends on blocking of bacterial DNA replication by binding itself to an enzyme called DNA gyrase, which allows the untwisting required to replicate one DNA double helix into two. Notably the drug has 100 times higher affinity for bacterial DNA gyrase than for mammalian.The bactericidal action of Norfloxacin results from inhibition of the enzymes topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV, which are required for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination. Norfloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic agent that is shown to be effective against various Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial species."
705,"Amoxicillin alone is indicated to treat susceptible bacterial infections of the ear, nose, throat, genitourinary tract, skin, skin structure, and lower respiratory tract.Amoxicillin, or BRL-2333, is a penicillin G derivative first described in the literature in 1972. Amoxicillin has similar activity to  and , but leads to higher serum concentrations than ampicillin. Amoxicillin was granted FDA approval on 18 January 1974.Amoxicillin competitively inhibit penicillin binding proteins, leading to upregulation of autolytic enzymes and inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Amoxicillin has a long duration of action as it is usually given twice daily. Amoxicillin has a wide therapeutic range as mild overdoses are not associated with significant toxicity."
706,"For the treatment of infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Haemophilus influenzae. Azlocillin is a semisynthetic ampicillin-derived acylureido penicillin. Similar to  and , azlocillin is an acylampicillin that exhibits an extended-spectrum of activity and in vitro potency that is greater than that of the carboxy penicillins. Azlocillin is shown to be effective against a broad spectrum of bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococci. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that azlocillin interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."
707,"Oxybutynin is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of overactive bladder, which causes urge urinary incontinence and frequency, and urgency. Oxybutynin may also be used for children aged 6 and above for the symptomatic management of detrusor muscle overactivity which has been found to be related to a neurological condition. Due to its urinary symptoms that include nocturia, urgency, and frequency, this condition causes social embarrassment and a poor quality of life. Oxybutynin, also marketed as Ditropan XL, is an anticholinergic medication used for the relief of overactive bladder symptoms that has been optimized for high levels of safety and efficacy since initial FDA approval in 1975. **A note on angioedema and anticholinergic effects**    Symptoms of angioedema may occur with oxybutynin therapy."
708,"A number of studies have shown that melatonin may be effective for treating sleep-wake cycle disturbances in children and adolescents with mental retardation, autism, and other central nervous system disorders. In mammals, melatonin is produced by the pineal gland. The melatonin receptors are G protein-coupled receptors and are expressed in various tissues of the body. MT1 receptor activation inhibits the adenylyl cyclase and its inhibition causes a rippling effect of non activation; starting with decreasing formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and then progressing to less protein kinase A (PKA) activity, which in turn hinders the phosphorilation of cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB binding protein) into P-CREB. The binding of melatonin to MT2 receptors inhibits adenylyl cyclase which decreases the formation of cAMP."
709,"For the treatment of mild to moderate infections in adults and adolescents (12 years of age or older) which are caused by susceptible strains of microorganisms in acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, and uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections. Cefditoren is an oral third-generation cephalosporin. It is commonly marketed under the trade name Spectracef by Cornerstone BioPharma. Cefditoren pivoxil is a prodrug which is hydrolyzed by esterases during absorption, and the drug is distributed in the circulating blood as active cefditoren. Cefditoren is a cephalosporin with antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens."
710,"Glipizide is an oral hypoglycemic agent in the second-generation sulfonylurea drug class that is used to control blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Compared to other members of the sulfonylurea drug group, glipizide displays rapid absorption and onset of action with the shortest half-life and duration of action, reducing the risk for long-lasting hypoglycemia that is often observed with blood glucose-lowering agents. Chronic administration of glipizide may result in down-regulation of the sulfonylurea receptors on pancreatic beta cells, which are molecular targets of the drug, leading to a reduced effect on insulin secretion. In response to high blood glucose levels, insulin promotes the uptake of glucose into the liver, muscle cells, and fat cells for storage. Glipizide, like other sulfonylurea drugs, is an insulin secretagogue, which works by stimulating the insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells thereby increasing the plasma concentrations of insulin."
711,"Additionally, clonazepam is also indicated for the treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, as defined in the DSM-V.    Alternatively, some regional prescribing information note that clonazepam is indicated for all clinical forms of epileptic disease and seizures in adults, especially absence seizures (petit mal) including atypical absence; primary or secondarily generalised tonic-clonic (grand mal), tonic or clonic seizures; partial (focal) seizures with elementary or complex symptomatology; various forms of myoclonic seizures, myoclonus and associated abnormal movements. The agent has also been indicated for treating panic disorder. Subsequently, benzodiazepines like clonazepam can bind to benzodiazepine receptors that are components of various varieties of GABA(a) receptors . This enhanced ligand binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA to the receptors increases the aforementioned chloride ion conduction (perhaps reportedly via an increase in the frequency of the chloride channel opening), resulting in a hyperpolarized cell membrane that prevents further excitation of the associated neuron cells . By enhancing the neuro-inhibitory activity of GABA, it is believed that clonazepam can facilitate in decreasing any excessive electrical nerve activity in the CNS that might be contributing to seizures ."
712,"Promethazine antagonizes a variety of receptors, allowing it to be used for a number of indications including allergic reactions, pain, sedation, nausea, and vomiting. Promethazine was granted FDA approval before 29 March 1951.Promethazine is is a histamine H1 antagonist that can be used for it's ability to induce sedation, reduce pain, and treat allergic reactions. Promethazine's effects generally last 4-6h but can last up to 12h. Antagonism of muscarinic and NMDA receptors contribute to its use as a sleep aid, as well as for anxiety and tension. Antagonism of histamine H1, muscarinic, and dopamine receptors in the medullary vomiting center make promethazine useful in the treatment of nausea and vomiting."
713,"Also used for the treatment of vitamin D dependent rickets, rickets or osteomalacia secondary to long-term high dose anticonvulsant therapy, early renal osteodystrophy, osteoporosis (in conjunction with calcium), and hypophosphatemia associated with Fanconi syndrome (with treatment of acidosis).A vitamin D that can be regarded as a reduction product of vitamin D2.Dihydrotachysterol is hydroxylated in the liver to 25-hydroxydihydrotachysterol, which is the major circulating active form of the drug. It does not undergo further hydroxylation by the kidney and therefore is the analogue of 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Dihydrotachysterol is effective in the elevation of serum calcium by stimulating intestinal calcium absorption and mobilizing bone calcium in the absence of parathyroid hormone and of functioning renal tissue. Dihydrotachysterol also increases renal phosphate excretion.Once hydroxylated to 25-hydroxydihydrotachysterol, the modified drug binds to the vitamin D receptor. Vitamin D (when bound to the vitamin D receptor)stimulates the expression of a number of proteins involved in transporting calcium from the lumen of the intestine, across the epithelial cells and into blood. This stimulates intestinal calcium absorption and increases renal phosphate excretion."
714,"For the treatment of Hay fever, urticaria (hives) and allergic rhinitisMequitazine is a histamine H1 antagonist (antihistamine). Once the mast cell-antibody-antigen complex is formed, a complex series of events occurs that eventually leads to cell-degranulation and the release of histamine (and other chemical mediators) from the mast cell or basophil. Once released, histamine can react with local or widespread tissues through histamine receptors. Histamine, acting on H1-receptors, produces pruritis, vasodilatation, hypotension, flushing, headache, tachycardia, and bronchoconstriction. It provides effective, temporary relief of sneezing, watery and itchy eyes, and runny nose due to hay fever and other upper respiratory allergies.Mequitazine binds to the histamine H1 receptor sites on effector cells in the gastrointestinal tract, blood vessels, and respiratory tract."
715,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved atazanavir on June 20, 2003.Atazanavir (ATV) is an azapeptide HIV-1 protease inhibitor (PI) with activity against Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1). HIV-1 isolates with 93- to 183-fold reduced susceptibility to atazanavir from three different viral strains were selected in cell culture for 5 months. Recombinant viruses containing the I50L substitution without other major PI substitutions were growth impaired and displayed increased susceptibility in cell culture to other PIs (amprenavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir). Concentration- and dose-dependent prolongation of the PR interval in the electrocardiogram has been observed in healthy subjects receiving atazanavir. In placebo-controlled Study AI424-076, the mean (±SD) maximum change in PR interval from the predose value was 24 (±15) msec following oral dosing with 400 mg of atazanavir (n=65) compared to 13 (±11) msec following dosing with placebo (n=67)."
716,"For the treatment of adult patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who have not responded to or whose disease has progressed during treatment with at least one standard alkylating-agent containing regimenFludarabine is a chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of hematological malignancies. It is commonly marketed under the brand name Fludara.Fludarabine is a chemotherapy drug used in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. It acts at DNA polymerase alpha, ribonucleotide reductase and DNA primase, results in the inhibition of DNA synthesis, and destroys the cancer cells.Fludarabine phosphate is rapidly dephosphorylated to 2-fluoro-ara-A and then phosphorylated intracellularly by deoxycytidine kinase to the active triphosphate, 2-fluoro-ara-ATP. This metabolite appears to act by inhibiting DNA polymerase alpha, ribonucleotide reductase and DNA primase, thus inhibiting DNA synthesis. The mechanism of action of this antimetabolite is not completely characterized and may be multi-faceted."
717,"However, it also has antiemetic, antitussive, hypnotic, and antiparkinson properties . As histamine receptors exist both peripherally and in the central nervous system, diphenhydramine has been shown to cause sedation due to its competitive antagonism of histamine H1 receptors within the central nervous system . The anti-histamine action occurs by blocking the spasmogenic and congestive effects of histamine by competing with histamine for H1 receptor sites on effector cells, preventing but not reversing responses mediated by histamine alone . Anti-vertigo action is by a central antimuscarinic effect on the vestibular apparatus and the integrative vomiting center and medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone of the midbrain .Diphenhydramine predominantly works via the antagonism of H1 (Histamine 1) receptors . Such H1 receptors are located on respiratory smooth muscles, vascular endothelial cells, the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), cardiac tissue, immune cells, the uterus, and the central nervous system (CNS) neurons ."
718,"Atorvastatin can be used as a preventive agent for myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization, and angina, in patients without coronary heart disease but with multiple risk factors and in patients with type 2 diabetes without coronary heart disease but multiple risk factors. Several landmark studies demonstrate that the use of statins is associated with both a reduction in LDL levels and CVD risk. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Elevated cholesterol levels (and high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in particular) are an important risk factor for the development of CVD. Further studies have demonstrated statins affect Lp(a) levels differently in patients with dyslipidemia depending on their apo(a) phenotype; statins increase Lp(a) levels exclusively in patients with the low molecular weight apo(a) phenotype.Atorvastatin is a statin medication and a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis."
719,"Etidronate is indicated to treat Paget's disease of bone, as well as the treatment and prevention of heterotropic ossification after total hip replacement of spinal cord injury.Etidronic acid is a first generation bisphosphonate similar to  and . These drugs were developed to mimic the action of pyrophosphate, a regulator of calcification and decalcification. Etidronate’s use has decreased over the years in favor of the third generation, nitrogen containing bisphosphonate , , , and . Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of upper gastrointestinal adverse reactions.Bisphosphonates are taken into the bone where they bind to hydroxyapatite. Disruption of the podosomes causes osteoclasts to detach from bones, preventing bone resorption."
720,"For the treatment and management of Congestive cardiac insufficiency, arrhythmias and heart failure.Deacetyllanatoside C. A cardiotonic glycoside from the leaves of Digitalis lanata.Deslanoside is a cardiac glycoside used to treat congestive heart failure and supraventricular arrhythmias due to reentry mechanisms, and to control ventricular rate in the treatment of chronic atrial fibrillation.Deslanoside inhibits the Na-K-ATPase membrane pump, resulting in an increase in intracellular sodium and calcium concentrations. Increased intracellular concentrations of calcium may promote activation of contractile proteins (e.g., actin, myosin). Deslanoside also acts on the electrical activity of the heart, increasing the slope of phase 4 depolarization, shortening the action potential duration, and decreasing the maximal diastolic potential."
721,"Vigabatrin is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of refractory complex partial seizures in patients 2 years of age and older who have had inadequate responses to multiple previous treatments (i.e. not to be used for first-line therapy). Although administered as a racemic mixture, only the S(+) enantiomer is pharmacologically active. It was first introduced as an antiepileptic agent in the United Kingdom in 1989 and was used extensively until 1997, when an association with vision loss became apparent. Vigabatrin prevents the metabolism of GABA by irreversibly inhibiting GABA transaminase (GABA-T). Vigabatrin increases concentrations of GABA in the central nervous system by irreversibly inhibiting the enzymes responsible for its metabolism to succinic semialdehyde: gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase (GABA-T)."
722,"For the temporary relief of the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis.Emedastine is an antihistamine used in eye drops to treat allergic conjunctivitis.Emedastine is a relatively selective H1-receptor antagonist.Emedastine is a relatively selective, histamine H1 antagonist. In vitro examinations of emedastine's affinity for histamine receptors demonstrate relative selectivity for the H1 histamine receptor. In vivo studies have shown concentration-dependent inhibition of histamine-stimulated vascular permeability in the conjunctiva following topical ocular administration. Emedastine appears exert negligible effects on adrenergic, dopaminergic and serotonin receptors."
723,"Pilocarpine is associated with parasympathomimetic effects by selectively working on muscarinic receptors. Pilocarpine is used to treat dry mouth and various ophthalmic conditions, including elevated intraocular pressure and glaucoma. Because pilocarpine may affect all five muscarinic receptor subtypes, it is associated with parasympathetic side effects.The muscarinic M3 receptor is expressed in various endocrine and exocrine glands, including the gastric and salivary glands. It is also found in smooth muscle cells in pupillary sphincter and ciliary bodies. Pilocarpine is an agonist for M1 and M2 receptors, and is a full and partial agonist at the M3 receptor."
724,"Benzocaine products are indicated for topical anesthesia in a wide variety of conditions including skin irritation, oral pain, and hemorrhoids.Benzocaine is an ester local anesthetic that acts by preventing transmission of impulses along nerve fibers and at nerve endings. It is commonly used for local anesthesia in many over the counter products. Benzocaine was first used for local anesthesia in dentistry.Benzocaine is indicated for use as a topical anesthetic. It has a duration of action of approximately 10 minutes and a wide therapeutic window. Patients should be counselled regarding the risks of methemoglobinemia.Benzocaine diffuses into nerve cells where it binds to sodium channels, preventing the channels from opening, and blocking the influx of sodium ions."
725,"For the treatment of hypertension.Deserpidine is an ester alkaloid drug isolated from Rauwolfia canescens (family Apocynaceae) with antipsychotic and antihypertensive properties that has been used for the control of high blood pressure and for the relief of psychotic behavior.Deserpidine, an alkaloid of Rauwolfia canescens, is used as an antihypertensive. Rauwolfia alkaloids work by controlling nerve impulses along certain nerve pathways. As a result, they act on the heart and blood vessels to lower blood pressure.Deserpidine's mechanism of action is through inhibition of the ATP/Mg2+ pump responsible for the sequestering of neurotransmitters into storage vesicles located in the presynaptic neuron. The neurotransmitters that are not sequestered in the storage vesicle are readily metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO) causing a reduction in catecholamines."
726,"For the treatment of atrial fibrillation and flutter and heart failureA cardioactive glycoside consisting of rhamnose and ouabagenin, obtained from the seeds of Strophanthus gratus and other plants of the Apocynaceae; used like digitalis. It is commonly used in cell biological studies as an inhibitor of the NA(+)-K(+)-exchanging ATPase.Ouabain, a cardiac glycoside similar to digitoxin, is used to treat congestive heart failure and supraventricular arrhythmias due to reentry mechanisms, and to control ventricular rate in the treatment of chronic atrial fibrillation.Ouabain inhibits the Na-K-ATPase membrane pump, resulting in an increase in intracellular sodium and calcium concentrations. Increased intracellular concentrations of calcium may promote activation of contractile proteins (e.g., actin, myosin). Ouabain also acts on the electrical activity of the heart, increasing the slope of phase 4 depolarization, shortening the action potential duration, and decreasing the maximal diastolic potential."
727,"Fluvastatin belongs to a class of medications called statins and is used to reduce plasma cholesterol levels and prevent cardiovascular disease. It is also the first entirely synthetic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and is structurally distinct from the fungal derivatives of this therapeutic class. Fluvastatin is a racemate comprising equimolar amounts of (3R,5S)- and (3S,5R)-fluvastatin.Fluvastatin, the first synthetically-derived HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, is a hydrophilic, acidic, antilipemic agent used to lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels associated with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia (Fredrickson types IIa and IIb), to slow the progression of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with CHD and as secondary prevention therapy in patients with CHD to reduce the risk of requiring coronary revascularization procedures. Although similar to lovastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin, fluvastatin has a shorter half-life, no active metabolites, extensive protein binding, and minimal CSF penetration. HMG-CoA reductase is responsible for converting HMG-CoA to mevalonate, the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis."
728,"Has also been used for the prevention of acute and chronic rejection in recipients of solid organ trasnplants and is designated by the FDA as an orphan drug for this use.Leflunomide is a pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor belonging to the DMARD (disease-modifying antirheumatic drug) class of drugs, which are chemically and pharmacologically very heterogeneous. Leflunomide was approved by FDA and in many other countries (e.g., Canada, Europe) in 1999.Leflunomide is a pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor indicated in adults for the treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Therefore, activated T cells, which are dependent on de novo pyrimidine synthesis, will be more affected by leflunomide's inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase than other cell types that use the salvage pathway of pyrimidine synthesis.Leflunomide is a prodrug that is rapidly and almost completely metabolized following oral administration to its pharmacologically active metabolite, A77 1726. It has been suggested that leflunomide exerts its immunomodulating effects by preventing the expansion of activated autoimmune lymphocytes via interferences with cell cycle progression. Inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase by A77 1726 prevents production of rUMP by the de novo pathway; such inhibition leads to decreased rUMP levels, decreased DNA and RNA synthesis, inhibition of cell proliferation, and G1 cell cycle arrest."
729,"More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as ""bad cholesterol""), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. Rosuvastatin is also a unique member of the class of statins due to its high hydrophilicity which increases hepatic uptake at the site of action, low bioavailability, and minimal metabolism via the Cytochrome P450 system. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The risk of myopathy during treatment with rosuvastatin may be increased with concurrent administration of some other lipid-lowering therapies (such as  or ), , , /, /ritonavir, or ."
730,"For the treatment (in combination with amphotericin B) of serious infections caused by susceptible strains of Candida (septicemia, endocarditis and urinary system infections) and/or Cryptococcus (meningitis and pulmonary infections).A fluorinated cytosine analog that is used as an antifungal agent.Flucytosine is an antimetabolite that acts as an antifungal agent with in vitro and in vivo activity against Candida and Cryptococcus. Flucytosine enters the fungal cell via cytosine permease; thus, flucytosine is metabolized to 5-fluorouracil within fungal organisms. The 5-fluorouracil is extensively incorporated into fungal RNA and inhibits synthesis of both DNA and RNA. The result is unbalanced growth and death of the fungal organism. Antifungal synergism between Ancobon and polyene antibiotics, particularly amphotericin B, has been reported.Although the exact mode of action is unknown, it has been proposed that flucytosine acts directly on fungal organisms by competitive inhibition of purine and pyrimidine uptake and indirectly by intracellular metabolism to 5-fluorouracil."
731,"Used for the suppression of motor and phonic tics in patients with Tourette's Disorder who have failed to respond satisfactorily to standard treatment.A diphenylbutylpiperidine that is effective as an antipsychotic agent and as an alternative to haloperidol for the suppression of vocal and motor tics in patients with Tourette syndrome. Although the precise mechanism of action is unknown, blockade of postsynaptic dopamine receptors has been postulated. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1994, p403)Pimozide is an orally active antipsychotic drug product which shares with other antipsychotics the ability to blockade dopaminergic receptors on neurons in the central nervous system. However, receptor blockade is often accompanied by a series of secondary alterations in central dopamine metabolism and function which may contribute to both pimozide's therapeutic and untoward effects. In addition, pimozide, in common with other antipsychotic drugs, has various effects on other central nervous system receptor systems which are not fully characterized."
732,"Capecitabine is a prodrug, that is enzymatically converted to fluorouracil (antimetabolite) in the tumor, where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumor tissue.Capecitabine is a fluoropyrimidine carbamate belonging to a group of antineoplastic agents called antimetabolites, which kill cancerous cells by interfering with DNA synthesis. If correctly positioned, dUMP, CH2THF, and TS would form a ternary complex to facilitate the donation of the methyl group from CH2THF to dUMP. TS inhibition prevents the conversion of dUMP to dTMP, depleting the pool of dTMP that could be phosphorylated into dTTP to be incorporated as DNA nucleotides. Repeated base excision repair can result in abasic sites, which can lead to DNA mutagenesis and thus protein miscoding, replication forks collapse, and DNA fragmentation through single or double strand breaks      However, several reports have found that the incorporation of uracil in genomic DNA does not significantly affect the cytotoxicity of 5-FU, suggesting that the cytotoxic effect of 5-FU is dominated by the perturbation of RNA through 5-FUTP. Although the main mechanism of 5-FU cytotoxicity was thought to be attributed to DNA damages, recent reports have shown that the majority of 5-FU pharmacological action is mediated through RNA, since 5-FU is accumulated ~3000- to 15 000-fold more in RNA compared to that of DNA."
733,"Used to elicit acute cardiovascular responses (cardiac stumulant), similar to those produced by exercise, in order to aid in diagnosing the presence or absence of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients who cannot exercise adequately.Arbutamine, administered through a closed-loop, computer-controlled drug-delivery system, is indicated to elicit acute cardiovascular responses, similar to those produced by exercise, in order to aid in diagnosing the presence or absence of coronary artery disease in patients who cannot exercise adequately .Arbutamine is a synthetic catecholamine with positive chronotropic and inotropic properties. The chronotropic (increase in heart rate) and inotropic (increase in force of contraction) effects of arbutamine serve to mimic exercise by increasing cardiac work (producing stress) and provoke myocardial ischemia in patients with compromised coronary arteries. The increase in heart rate caused by arbutamine is thought to limit regional subendocardial perfusion, thereby limiting tissue oxygenation. In functional assays, arbutamine is more selective for beta-adrenergic receptors than for alpha-adrenergic receptors. The degree of hypotension that occurs for a given chronotropic activity is less with arbutamine than, for example, with isoproterenol because alpha receptor activity is retained."
734,"Sertraline is indicated for the management of major depressive disorder (MDD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder (PD), premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), and social anxiety disorder (SAD). Sertraline is a popular antidepressant medication commonly known as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and is similar to drugs such as  and . Despite marked structural differences between compounds in this drug class, SSRIs exert similar pharmacological effects. In animal studies, chronic administration of sertraline results in down-regulation of brain norepinephrine receptors. In vitro, sertraline shows little to no affinity for GABA, dopaminergic, serotonergic (5HT1A, 5HT1B, 5HT2), or benzodiazepine receptors."
735,"For the treatment of obesity. Sibutramine (trade name Meridia in the USA, Reductil in Europe and other countries), usually as sibutramide hydrochloride monohydrate, is an orally administered agent for the treatment of obesity. The parent compound, sibutramine, is a potent inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake in vivo, but not in vitro. However, metabolites M1 and M2 inhibit the reuptake of these neurotransmitters both in vitro and in vivo. In human brain tissue, M1 and M2 also inhibit dopamine reuptake in vitro, but with ~3-fold lower potency than for the reuptake inhibition of serotonin or norepinephrine."
736,"As an ophthalmic for the temporary relief of the signs and symptoms of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis. Levocabastine was discovered at Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1979.Levocabastine is a selective histamine H1-receptor antagonist exerting inhibitory effects on the release of chemical mediators from mast cells and on the chemotaxis of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and eosinophils. Both histamine and antigens induced conjunctivitis can be inhibited by levocabastine. Levocabastine can also reduce symptoms of allergic rhinitis by preventing an increase in vascular permeability of nasal mucosa.Levocabastine is a potent, selective histamine H1-receptor antagonist. It thereby prevents, but does not reverse, responses mediated by histamine alone."
737,"For the treatment of insomnia.Methyprylon is a sedative of the piperidinedione derivative family that was previously used for the treatment of insomnia. However, with the introduction of newer drugs with fewer side effects, such as benzodiazepines, the clinical use of methyprylon is now limited. Methyprylon was withdrawn from the U.S. market in June 1965 and the Canadian market in September 1990 due to adverse events.Methyprylon, a piperidinedione CNS depressant, is close to barbituric acid in structure, but different enough to be called a ""non-barbiturate"" sedative-hynotic. Methyprylon is used for insomnia and daytime tension. Methyprylon depresses the activity of muscle tissues, the heart, and the respiratory system.Methyprylon binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl- ionopore at the GABAA receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl- ionopore is open."
738,"Used in the treatment of Cushing's syndrome. It was withdrawn from the United States market in April 1994.Trilostane blocks an enzyme involved in the production of several steroids including cortisol. In Cushing's syndrome, the adrenal gland overproduces steroids. Although steroids are important for various functions of the body, too much can cause problems. This product was withdrawn from the U.S. market in April 1994.Trilostane produces suppression of the adrenal cortex by inhibiting enzymatic conversion of steroids by 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/delta 5,4 ketosteroid isomerase, thus blocking synthesis of adrenal steroids."
739,"Miconazole is available as both a suppository and cream for the treatment of vaginal yeast infections and the relief of associated vulvar itching and irritation. Lastly, miconazole cream is effective in treating athlete's foot (tinea pedis), jock itch (tinea cruris), ringworm infections (tinea corporis), pityriasis (formerly tinea) versicolor, and cutaneous candidiasis.Miconazole is a broad-spectrum azole antifungal with some activity against Gram-positive bacteria as well. Miconazole is thought to act primarily through the inhibition of fungal CYP450 14α-lanosterol demethylase activity. Patients using intravaginal miconazole products are advised not to rely on contraceptives to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, as well as not to use tampons concurrently.Miconazole is an azole antifungal used to treat a variety of conditions, including those caused by _Candida_ overgrowth. In addition, miconazole inhibits fungal peroxidase and catalase while not affecting NADH oxidase activity, leading to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)."
740,"Cefuroxime is a β-lactam type antibiotic. More specifically, it is a second-generation cephalosporin. Cephalosporins work the same way as penicillins: they interfere with the peptidoglycan synthesis of the bacterial wall by inhibiting the final transpeptidation needed for the cross-links. Cefuroxime axetil is the prodrug Cefuroxime, like the penicillins, is a beta-lactam antibiotic. By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, it inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis."
741,"It is a direct-acting smooth muscle relaxant used in the treatment of impotence and as a vasodilator, especially for cerebral vasodilation. The main actions of Papaverine are exerted on cardiac and smooth muscle. Like qathidine, Papaverine acts directly on the heart muscle to depress conduction and prolong the refractory period. Papaverine relaxes various smooth muscles. This relaxation may be prominent if spasm exists."
742,"It has also been used in veterinary applications. One of the most widely used of the classical antihistaminics, it generally causes less drowsiness and sedation than promethazine.In allergic reactions an allergen interacts with and cross-links surface IgE antibodies on mast cells and basophils. Once the mast cell-antibody-antigen complex is formed, a complex series of events occurs that eventually leads to cell-degranulation and the release of histamine (and other chemical mediators) from the mast cell or basophil. Once released, histamine can react with local or widespread tissues through histamine receptors. It provides effective, temporary relief of sneezing, watery and itchy eyes, and runny nose due to hay fever and other upper respiratory allergies.Chlorpheniramine binds to the histamine H1 receptor."
743,"Nifedipine capsules are indicated to treat vasospastic angina and chronic stable angina. Extended release tablets are indicated to treat vasospastic angina, chronic stable angina, and hypertension.Nifedipine, or BAY a 1040, is a first generation dihydropyridine L-type calcium channel blocker, similar to . Since nifedipine's development, second and third generation dihydropyridines have been developed with slower onsets and longer durations of action. Nifedipine was granted FDA approval on 31 December 1981.Nifedipine is an inhibitor of L-type voltage gated calcium channels that reduces blood pressure and increases oxygen supply to the heart. Immediate release nifedipine's duration of action requires dosing 3 times daily."
744,"For the treatment or prevention of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in patients who are intolerant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). Atovaquone is a highly lipophilic drug that closely resembles the structure ubiquinone. Its inhibitory effect being comparable to ubiquinone, atovaquone can act by selectively affecting mitochondrial electron transport and parallel processes such as ATP and pyrimidine biosynthesis in atovaquone-responsive parasites. Cytochrome bc1 complex (complex III) seems to serve as a highly discriminating molecular target for atovaquone in Plasmodia. Inhibition of electron transport by atovaquone will result in indirect inhibition of these enzymes."
745,"The FDA emphasizes that this drug should only be given in these conditions when they are clinically documented and have not responded to normal therapeutic doses of other antiarrhythmic agents, or when other drugs are not tolerated by the patient. Off-label indications include atrial fibrillation and supraventricular tachycardia.Amiodarone is a benzofuran derivative, anti-arrhythmic drug used commonly in a variety of settings. Most known for its approved indication in life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, it is also used off-label in the outpatient and inpatient setting for atrial fibrillation. Thyrotoxicosis or hypothyroidism may also result from the administration of amiodarone, which contains high levels of iodine, and interferes with normal thyroid function.Amiodarone is considered a class III anti-arrhythmic drug. As a result amiodarone increases the duration of the action potential as well as the effective refractory period for cardiac cells (myocytes)."
746,"Diazoxide may also be used parentally or intravenously to treat hypertensive emergencies.Diazoxide is a non-diuretic benzothiadiazine derivative that activates ATP-sensitive potassium channels. The hypotensive effects of diazoxide are usually not detected when administered orally. The use of intravenous or oral diazoxide may lead to the development of pulmonary hypertension in infants and neonates.Diazoxide is a nondiuretic benzothiadiazine derivative used for the management of symptomatic hypoglycemia. This hyperpolarizes the cell membrane and prevents the influx of calcium to the pancreatic beta‐cells. The mechanism of action of its hypotensive effect has not been fully elucidated; however, it is possible that it involves the antagonism of calcium."
747,"Gliclazide belongs to the sulfonylurea class of insulin secretagogues, which act by stimulating &beta; cells of the pancreas to release insulin. Sulfonylureas also increase peripheral glucose utilization, decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis and may increase the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors. Due to their mechanism of action, sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia and require consistent food intake to decrease this risk. Overall, it potentiates insulin release and improves insulin dynamics.Gliclazide binds to the &beta; cell sulfonyl urea receptor (SUR1). The binding results in closure of the channels and leads to a resulting decrease in potassium efflux leads to depolarization of the &beta; cells."
748,"Used to control certain seizures in the treatment of epilepsy.Phenacemide is used to control certain seizures in the treatment of epilepsy. This medicine acts on the central nervous system (CNS) to reduce the number and severity of seizures.Phenacemide is a ureal anticonvulsant indicated for control of severe epilepsy, particularly mixed forms of complex partial (psychomotor or temporal lobe) seizures, refractory to other anticonvulsants. Phenacemide elevates the threshold for minimal electroshock convulsions and abolishes the tonic phase of maximal electroshock seizures. It also prevents or modifies seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol or other convulsants.Phenacemide binds to and blocks neuronal sodium channels or voltage sensitive calcium channels. This blocks or suppresses neuronal depolarization and hypersynchronization."
749,"It is structurally similar to acetohexamide, chlorpropamide and tolazamide and belongs to the sulfonylurea class of insulin secretagogues, which act by stimulating β cells of the pancreas to release insulin. Sulfonylureas also increase peripheral glucose utilization, decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis and may increase the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors. Sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain, though less so than insulin. Due to their mechanism of action, sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia and require consistent food intake to decrease this risk. The pancreas must be able to produce insulin for this drug to work.Sulfonylureas lower blood glucose in patients with NIDDM by directly stimulating the acute release of insulin from functioning beta cells of pancreatic islet tissue by an unknown process that involves a sulfonylurea receptor (receptor 1) on the beta cell."
750,"Its anticoagulant action is mediated through the inhibition of the vitamin K-mediated gamma-carboxylation of precursor proteins that are critical in forming the formation of active procoagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X, as well as the anticoagulant proteins C and S, in the liver.Anisindione is a synthetic anticoagulant and an indanedione derivative. It is prescribed only if you cannot take coumarin-type anticoagulants such as coumadin as anisindione is a powerful drug with serious potential side effects. Anticoagulants decrease the clotting ability of the blood and therefore help to prevent harmful clots from forming in the blood vessels. These medicines are sometimes called blood thinners, although they do not actually thin the blood. They also will not dissolve clots that already have formed, but they may prevent the clots from becoming larger and causing more serious problems.Like phenindione, to which it is related chemically, anisindione exercises its therapeutic action by reducing the prothrombin activity of the blood."
751,"Type I and II 5α-reductase enzymes convert testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a primary hormonal mediator that plays a role in the development and enlargement of the prostate gland. However, unlike finasteride, dutasteride is not yet indicated for the treatment of androgenic alopecia although it was demonstrated to be effective in several randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in androgenetic alopecia.Dutasteride is a synthetic 4-azasteroid compound that selectively inhibits both the type I and type II isoforms of steroid 5α-reductase, an intracellular enzyme that converts testosterone to 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Dutasteride works by reducing the levels of circulating DHT. Compared to a 70% reduction of serum DHT levels caused by , a near-complete suppression of serum DHT-more than 90% is seen with dutasteride. By forming a stable complex with both type II and type II 5α-reductase, dutasteride inhibits its enzymatic action of converting testosterone to 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is the androgen primarily responsible for the initial development and subsequent enlargement of the prostate gland."
752,"For topical application in the treatment of tinea pedis, tinea cruris, and tinea corporis caused by Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Trichophyton tonsurans, Microsporum canis, Microsporum audouini, Microsporum gypseum, and Epidermophyton floccosum, in the treatment of cutaneous candidiasis, and in the treatment of tinea versicolor.

753,"Bicalutamide is indicated in combination with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist for the treatment of Stage D2 metastatic carcinoma of the prostate.Bicalutamide is an oral non-steroidal anti-androgen for prostate cancer. It is comprised of a racemic mixture that is a 50:50 composition of the (R)-bicalutamide and (S)-bicalutamide enantionmers. Bicalutamide binds to the androgen receptor.Bicalutamide is an antineoplastic hormonal agent primarily used in the treatment of prostate cancer. Prostate cancer is mostly androgen-dependent and can be treated with surgical or chemical castration. To date, antiandrogen monotherapy has not consistently been shown to be equivalent to castration.Bicalutamide competes with androgen for the binding of androgen receptors, consequently blocking the action of androgens of adrenal and testicular origin which stimulate the growth of normal and malignant prostatic tissue."
754,"Rabeprazole is an antiulcer drug in the class of proton pump inhibitors. It reduces symptoms and prevents injury to the esophagus or stomach in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or ulcers. Rabeprazole is a selective and irreversible proton pump inhibitor, suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+, K+ -ATPase, which is found at the secretory surface of parietal cells. Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, rabeprazole has been characterized as a gastric proton-pump inhibitor. In gastric parietal cells, rabeprazole is protonated, accumulates, and is transformed to an active sulfenamide."
755,"Pioglitazone is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is also available in combination with , , or  for the same indication.Pioglitazone is an antihyperglycemic used as an adjunct to diet, exercise, and other antidiabetic medications to manage type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is administered as a racemic mixture, though there is no pharmacologic difference between the enantiomers and they appear to interconvert _in vivo_ with little consequence. The thiazolidinedione class of medications, which also includes  and , exerts its pharmacological effect primarily by promoting insulin sensitivity and the improved uptake of blood glucose via agonism at the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ). Pioglitazone should not be used in patients with active bladder cancer and should be used with caution in patients with a history of bladder cancer.Pioglitazone is a selective agonist at peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) in target tissues for insulin action such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver."
756,"Used to provide skeletal muscle relaxation as an adjunct to general anesthesia, for endotracheal intubation or to facilitate mechanical ventilation.Doxacurium chloride is a long-acting, nondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxant for intravenous administration.Doxacurium chloride is a long-acting, nondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxant. The neuromuscular block produced by doxacurium chloride may be antagonized by anticholinesterase agents. As with other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents, the more profound the neuromuscular block at reversal, the longer the time and the greater the dose of anticholinesterase required for recovery of neuromuscular function. Doxacurium chloride is approximately 2.5 to 3 times more potent than pancuronium and 10 to 12 times more potent than metocurine.Doxacurium chloride binds competitively to cholinergic receptors on the motor end-plate to antagonize the action of acetylcholine, resulting in a block of neuromuscular transmission (non-depolarizing). This action is antagonized by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as neostigmine."
757,"Carvedilol is indicated to treat mild to severe heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction with ventricular ejection fraction ≤40%, or hypertension.Carvedilol is a racemic mixture where the S(-) enantiomer is both a beta and alpha-1 adrenoceptor blocker, and the R(+) enantiomer is an alpha-1 adrenoceptor blocker. It is currently used to treat heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction, and hypertension. The dual action of carvedilol is advantageous in combination therapies as moderate doses of 2 drugs have a decreased incidence of adverse effects compared to high dose monotherapy in the treatment of moderate hypertension. It has a long duration of action as it is generally taken once daily and has a broad therapeutic index as patients generally take 10-80mg daily. Carvedilol's action on alpha-1 adrenergic receptors relaxes smooth muscle in vasculature, leading to reduced peripheral vascular resistance and an overall reduction in blood pressure."
758,"In oral and intravenous formulations, levofloxacin is indicated in adults for the treatment of various infections caused by susceptible bacteria, including infections of the upper respiratory tract, lower respiratory tract, skin, skin structures, urinary tract, and prostate. The oral formulation is also indicated in both adults and children 6 months of age and older for the post-exposure management of inhalational anthrax caused by _Bacillus anthracis_ and for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of plague caused by _Yersinia pestis_. Levofloxacin, along with other quinolones such as  and , is a member of the third generation of fluoroquinolones, colloquially referred to as the ""respiratory quinolones"" due to improved activity against gram-positive bacteria commonly implicated in respiratory infections. As antimicrobial susceptibility patterns are geographically distinct, local antibiograms should be consulted to ensure adequate coverage of relevant pathogens prior to use.Levofloxacin, like other fluoroquinolone antibiotics, exerts its antimicrobial activity via the inhibition of two key bacterial enzymes: DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Bacterial topoisomerase IV, in addition to contributing to the relaxation of positive supercoils, is essential at the terminal stages of DNA replication and functions to “unlink” newly replicated chromosomes to allow for the completion of cell division."
759,"It lacks anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and diuretic properties.Sulfinpyrazone's pharmacologic activity is the potentiation of the urinary excretion of uric acid. It is useful for reducing the blood urate levels in patients with chronic tophaceous gout and acute intermittent gout, and for promoting the resorption of tophi.Sulfinpyrazone is an oral uricosuric agent (pyrazolone derivative) used to treat chronic or intermittent gouty arthritis. Sulfinpyrazone is not intended for the treatment of acute attacks because it lacks therapeutically useful analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. Sulfinpyrazone and its sulfide metabolite possess COX inhibitory effects. Sulfinpyrazone is also known to be a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) inhibitor as well as an inhibitor of several multridrug resistance proteins (MRPs)."
760,"For the treatment of the following infections (skin, UTI, ENT) caused by; S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, staphylococci, S. pyogenes (group A beta-hemolytic streptococci), E. coli, P. mirabilis, Klebsiella sp, coagulase-negative staphylococci and Streptococcus pyogenes. Long-acting, broad-spectrum, water-soluble, cephalexin derivative. Cefadroxil, a first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic, is used to treat urinary tract infections, skin and skin structure infections, pharyngitis, and tonsillitis. Like all beta-lactam antibiotics, cefadroxil binds to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, causing the inhibition of the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that cefadroxil interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."
761,"Indicated for the treatment of candidemia, acute disseminated candidiasis, and certain other invasive Candida infections, as well as esophageal candidiasis, and prophylaxis of Candida infections in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Micafungin is an antifungal drug. It belongs to the antifungal class of compounds known as echinocandins and exerts its effect by inhibiting the synthesis of 1,3-beta-D-glucan, an integral component of the fungal cell wall. Formerly known as FK463, micafungin is a semisynthetic lipopeptide synthesized from a fermentation product of Coleophoma empetri that works as an antifungal agent. It is a glucan synthesis inhibitor of the echinocandin structural class."
762,"Oral doxepin is approved for the following indications:    - Treatment of depression and/or anxiety. - Treatment of manic-depressive disorder. However, in 2010 it was approved for the treatment of insomnia. This effect on histamine receptors indicates effectiveness in skin conditions. Breaking its function according to the different effect, doxepin's antidepressive action is primarily associated with the inhibition of the central nervous system biogenic amine reuptake; more specifically, norepinephrine and serotonin at synaptic nerve terminals."
763,"For adjunctive treatment of: chronic simple (open-angle) glaucoma, secondary glaucoma, and preoperatively in acute angle-closure glaucoma where delay of surgery is desired in order to lower intraocular pressureA carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that is used in the treatment of glaucoma.Dichlorphenamide is an oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor indicated for adjunctive treatment of: chronic simple (open-angle) glaucoma, secondary glaucoma, and preoperatively in acute angle-closure glaucoma where delay of surgery is desired in order to lower intraocular pressure. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors reduce intraocular pressure by partially suppressing the secretion of aqueous humor (inflow).Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors reduce intraocular pressure by partially suppressing the secretion of aqueous humor (inflow), although the mechanism by which they do this is not fully understood. Evidence suggests that HCO3- ions are produced in the ciliary body by hydration of carbon dioxide under the influence of carbonic anhydrase and diffuse into the posterior chamber which contains more Na+ and HCO3- ions than does plasma and consequently is hypertonic. Water is then attracted to the posterior chamber by osmosis, resulting in a drop in pressure."
764,"Antihistamines used in the treatment of allergy act by competing with histamine for H 1-receptor sites on effector cells. Antihistamines antagonize, in varying degrees, most of the pharmacological effects of histamine, including urticaria and pruritus.Diphenylpyraline is an antihistamine that prevents, but does not reverse, responses mediated by histamine alone. Diphenylpyraline antagonizes most of the pharmacological effects of histamine, including urticaria and pruritus. Also, diphenylpyraline may exhibit anticholinergic actions (as do most of the antihistamines) and may thus provide a drying effect on the nasal mucosa.Antihistamines such as diphenylpyraline used in the treatment of allergy act by competing with histamine for H1-receptor sites on effector cells. This reduces the effects of histamine, leading to a temporary reduction of allergy symptoms."
765,"Its sale was discontinued in 2003 in some countries, due to the small possibility of hepatic (liver) injury. On May 20, 2004, Bristol-Myers Squibb discontinued the sale of Serzone in the United States.Nefazodone, an antidepressant synthetically derived phenylpiperazine, is used to treat major depression. Although it is structurally similar to trazodone, nefazodone has a mechanism of action different from other antidepressants and, hence, lacks the risk for major cardiovascular toxicity seen with tricyclics and insomnia and inhibition of REM sleep seen with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.Within the serotonergic system, nefazodone acts as an antagonist at type 2 serotonin (5-HT2) post-synaptic receptors and, like fluoxetine-type antidepressants, inhibits pre-synaptic serotonin (5-HT) reuptake. Within the noradrenergic system, nefazodone inhibits norepinephrine uptake minimally. Nefazodone also antagonizes alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors, producing sedation, muscle relaxation, and a variety of cardiovascular effects."
766,"In depressed individuals, desipramine exerts a positive effect on mood. The antidepressant effects of TCAs are thought to be due to an overall increase in serotonergic neurotransmission. Desipramine exerts less anticholinergic and sedative side effects compared to tertiary amine TCAs, such as amitriptyline and clomipramine. Patients experiencing more severe depressive episodes may respond quicker than those with mild depressive symptoms.Desipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) that selectively blocks reuptake of norepinephrine (noradrenaline) from the neuronal synapse. Chronic use of desipramine also leads to down-regulation of beta-adrenergic receptors in the cerebral cortex and sensitization of serotonergic receptors."
767,"Used for the production of complete anaesthesia of short duration, for the induction of general anaesthesia, and for inducing a hypnotic state.A barbiturate that is administered intravenously for the production of complete anesthesia of short duration, for the induction of general anesthesia, or for inducing a hypnotic state. Barbiturates act as nonselective depressants of the central nervous system (CNS), capable of producing all levels of CNS mood alteration from excitation to mild sedation, hypnosis, and deep coma. In sufficiently high therapeutic doses, barbiturates induce anesthesia.Thiamylal binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl- ionopore at the GABAA receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl- ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged."

Gemifloxacin is a quinolone antibacterial agent with a broad-spectrum activity that is used in the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and mild-to-moderate pneumonia. It is available in oral formulations. Gemifloxacin acts by inhibiting DNA synthesis through the inhibition of both DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, which are essential for bacterial growth. Gemifloxacin is a quinolone/fluoroquinolone antibiotic."
769,"When used as an aid to smoking cessation, bupropion is thought to confer its anti-craving and anti-withdrawal effects by inhibiting dopamine reuptake, which is thought to be involved in the reward pathways associated with nicotine, and through the antagonism of the nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptor. When used in combination with  in the marketed product ContraveⓇ for chronic weight management, the two components are thought to have effects on areas of the brain involved in the regulation of food intake. As norepinephrine has been shown to have anticonvulsant properties, bupropion's inhibitory effects on NET are thought to contribute to its pro-convulsant activity. When used as an aid to smoking cessation, bupropion is thought to confer its anti-craving and anti-withdrawal effects by inhibiting dopamine reuptake, which is thought to be involved in the reward pathways associated with nicotine, and through the antagonism of the nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptor (AChR), thereby blunting the effects of nicotine. When used in combination with  in the marketed product ContraveⓇ for chronic weight management, the two components are thought to have effects on areas of the brain involved in the regulation of food intake."

Myelosuppression is its dose-limiting toxic effect.Trimetrexate, a non-classical folate antagonist, is a synthetic inhibitor of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). During DNA synthesis and cellular reproduction, folic acid is reduced to tetrahydrofolic acid by the enzyme folic acid reductase. Inhibition of DHFR results in the depletion of this coenzyme, leading directly to interference with thymidylate biosynthesis, as well as inhibition of folate-dependent formyltransferases, and indirectly to inhibition of p.r.n."
771,"For use in the prophylaxis and therapy of ventricular fibrillation. Also used in the treatment of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia, that have failed to respond to adequate doses of a first-line antiarrhythmic agent, such as lidocaine.Bretylium blocks the release of noradrenaline from the peripheral sympathetic nervous system, and is used in emergency medicine, cardiology, and other specialties for the acute management of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. The primary mode of action for bretylium is thought to be inhibition of voltage-gated K(+) channels. Recent evidence has shown that bretylium may also inhibit the Na,K-ATPase by binding to the extracellular K-site.Bretylium is a bromobenzyl quaternary ammonium compound which selectively accumulates in sympathetic ganglia and their postganglionic adrenergic neurons where it inhibits norepinephrine release by depressing adrenergic nerve terminal excitability. Bretylium also suppresses ventricular fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias.Bretylium inhibits norepinephrine release by depressing adrenergic nerve terminal excitability."
772,"For the induction and maintenance of general anesthesiaA nonflammable, halogenated, hydrocarbon anesthetic that provides relatively rapid induction with little or no excitement. nitrous oxide is often given concomitantly. Because halothane may not produce sufficient muscle relaxation, supplemental neuromuscular blocking agents may be required. It does so by decreasing the extent of gap junction mediated cell-cell coupling and altering the activity of the channels that underlie the action potential.Halothane causes general anaethesia due to its actions on multiple ion channels, which ultimately depresses nerve conduction, breathing, cardiac contractility. Its immobilizing effects have been attributed to its binding to potassium channels in cholinergic neurons."
773,"Used for aborting second-trimester pregnancy (between the twelfth to eighteenth week of gestation) and in incomplete abortion or for therapeutic abortion in cases of intrauterine fetal death and congenital abnormalities incompatible with life. Also used at low-doses for medically indicated induction of labor at term. Also injected intra-arterially for use as a vasodilator to assist in angiography.The tromethamine (THAM) salt of the naturally occurring prostaglandin F2 alpha, dinoprost tromethamine occurs as a white to off-white, very hygroscopic, crystalline powder. Dinoprost tromethamine may also be known as dinoprost trometamol, PGF2 alpha THAM, or prostaglandin F2 alpha tromethamine.Dinoprost tromethamine is the tromethamine (THAM) salt of the naturally occurring prostaglandin F2alpha. Prostaglandin F2alpha&nbsp;has several pharmacologic effects on the female reproductive system, including stimulation of myometrial activity, relaxation of the cervix, inhibition of steroidogenesis by corpora lutea, and can potentially lyse corpora lutea.Dinoprost tromethamine appears to act directly on the myometrium, but this has not been completely established."
774,"It is also indicated for the production of local anesthesia by infiltration, peripheral and central nerve block, and a preservative-free form can also be used for lumbar and caudal epidural blocks. Similar to other local anesthetics, it increases the threshold for electrical excitation in nerves by slowing the propagation of the nerve impulse and reducing the rate of rise of the action potential. Chloroprocaine can be given as an injection, and is available in formulations with and without methylparaben as a preservative. However, at toxic blood concentrations, chloroprocaine may cause atrioventricular block and cardiac arrest, as well as decreased cardiac output and arterial blood pressure. A high concentration of chloroprocaine in plasma can also lead to central nervous system stimulation, depression, or both."
775,"Terazosin blocks adrenaline's action on alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, causing relaxation of smooth muscle in blood vessels and the prostate.Terazosin is a quinazoline derivative alpha-1-selective adrenergic blocker.Terazosin is selective for alpha-1-adrenoceptors but not their individual subtypes. Inhibition of these alpha-1-adrenoceptors results in relaxation of smooth muscle in blood vessels and the prostate, lowering blood pressure and improving urinary flow. It has also been shown that catecholamines induce factors responsible for mitogenesis and alpha-1-adrenergic receptor blockers inhibit this effect. A final long term mechanism of terazosin and other alpha-1-adrenergic receptor blockers is the induction of apoptosis of prostate cells. Treatment with terazosin enhances the expression of transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-beta1), which upregulates p27kip1, and the caspase cascade."
776,"Used in the treatment of urinary tract infections caused by some strains of E. coli and klebsiella and enterobacter species. Amdinocillin is not available in the United States.Amdinocillin is a novel, semisynthetic penicillin effective against many gram-negative bacteria. Organisms which produce high levels of plasma-mediated beta-lactamase are resistant to the drug.Amdinocillin is a stong and specific antagonist of Penicillin Binding Protein-2 (PBP 2). It is active against gram negative bacteria, preventing cell wall synthesis by inhibiting the activity of PBP2. Peptidoglycan is a polymer of sugars and amino acids that is the main component of bacterial cell walls."
777,"For the treatment of infections (respiratory tract, kidney, skin, soft tissue, UTI), urethral and cervical gonorrhoea.A synthetic fluoroquinolone (fluoroquinolones) antibacterial agent that inhibits the supercoiling activity of bacterial DNA gyrase, halting DNA replication.Ofloxacin is a quinolone/fluoroquinolone antibiotic. Ofloxacin is bactericidal and its mode of action depends on blocking of bacterial DNA replication by binding itself to an enzyme called DNA gyrase, which allows the untwisting required to replicate one DNA double helix into two. Notably the drug has 100 times higher affinity for bacterial DNA gyrase than for mammalian. Ofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.Ofloxacin acts on DNA gyrase and toposiomerase IV, enzymes which, like human topoisomerase, prevents the excessive supercoiling of DNA during replication or transcription. By inhibiting their function, the drug thereby inhibits normal cell division."
778,"Indicated for the alleviation of symptoms of intermittent claudication (pain in the legs that occurs with walking and disappears with rest).Cilostazol is a quinolinone derivative and antiplatelet agent with vasodilating properties that has been used in the symptomatic treatment of intermittent claudication in patients with peripheral ischaemia. It is marketed under the brand name Pletal by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co.. Cilostazol works by inhibiting both primary and secondary aggregation and reducing calcium-induced contractions.Cilostazol reduces the symptoms of intermittent claudication, as indicated by an increased walking distance. Intermittent claudication is pain in the legs that occurs with walking and disappears with rest. The pain occurs due to reduced blood flow to the legs.Cilostazol and several of its metabolites are cyclic AMP (cAMP) phosphodiesterase III inhibitors (PDE III inhibitors), inhibiting phosphodiesterase activity and suppressing cAMP degradation with a resultant increase in cAMP in platelets and blood vessels, leading to inhibition of platelet aggregation and vasodilation."

It exhibits in vitro activity against _Blastomyces dermatitidis_, _Histoplasma capsulatum_, _Histoplasma duboisii_, _Aspergillus flavus_, _Aspergillus fumigatus_, and _Trichophyton_ species.Itraconazole mediates its antifungal activity by inhibiting 14α-demethylase, a fungal cytochrome P450 enzyme that converts lanosterol to ergosterol, a vital component of fungal cell membranes."
780,"For use with other anticancer drugs for the treatment of stage III and stage IV Hodgkin's disease.An antineoplastic agent used primarily in combination with mechlorethamine, vincristine, and prednisone (the MOPP protocol) in the treatment of Hodgkin's disease.Procarbazine is an antineoplastic in the class of alkylating agents and is used to treat various forms of cancer. Alkylating agents are so named because of their ability to add alkyl groups to many electronegative groups under conditions present in cells. This makes the strands unable to uncoil and separate. There is evidence that the drug may act by inhibition of protein, RNA and DNA synthesis. In addition, procarbazine may directly damage DNA."

782,"For the treatment of moderate and severe hypertension, either alone or as an adjunct, and for the treatment of renal hypertension.An antihypertensive agent that acts by inhibiting selectively transmission in post-ganglionic adrenergic nerves. It is believed to act mainly by preventing the release of norepinephrine at nerve endings and causes depletion of norepinephrine in peripheral sympathetic nerve terminals as well as in tissues. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. It is a postganglionic sympathetic nerve terminal blocker that prevents the release of norepinephrine from nerve terminals.Guanethidine acts at the sympathetic neuroeffector junction by inhibiting or interfering with the release and/or distribution of norepinephrine (NE), rather than acting at the effector cell by inhibiting the association of norepinephrine with its receptors. It further reduces blood pressure by decreasing the degree of vasoconstriction that normally results from reflex sympathetic nervous activity upon assumption of the upright posture, thus reducing venous return and cardiac output more."
783,"For the treatment of major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder .A reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) selective for isoform A (RIMA) used to treat major depressive disorder. Most meta-analyses and most studies indicate that in the acute management of depression, moclobemide is more efficacious than placebo medication and similarly efficacious as tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Due to negligible anticholinergic and antihistaminic actions, moclobemide has been better tolerated than tri- or heterocyclic antidepressants . A selective, reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO) which increases the . Besides its presence in sympathetic nerves, there is an abundant evidence that MAO-A is localized in noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus and MAO-B is closely associated with serotonergic neurons of the raphe nucleus .The mechanism of action of moclobemide involves the selective, reversible inhibition of MAO-A."
784,"Indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomfort associated with acute painful musculo skeletal conditions.A muscarinic antagonist used to treat drug-induced parkinsonism and to relieve pain from muscle spasm.Orphenadrine is indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomfort associated with acute painful musculoskeletal conditions. Orphenadrine is an anticholinergic with a predominantly central effect and only a weak peripheral effect. Parkinson's syndrome is the consequence of a disturbed balance between cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission in the basal ganglia caused by a decrease in dopamine. The effect is somewhat less on bradykinesia.Orphenadrine binds and inhibits both histamine H1 receptors and NMDA receptors. It may have a relaxing effect on skeletal muscle spasms and it has a mood elevating effect."
785,"For the treatment of all types of seizures except absence seizures.A barbituric acid derivative that acts as a nonselective central nervous system depressant. It promotes binding to inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid subtype receptors, and modulates chloride currents through receptor channels. It also inhibits glutamate induced depolarizations.Phenobarbital, the longest-acting barbiturate, is used for its anticonvulsant and sedative-hypnotic properties in the management of all seizure disorders except absence (petit mal).Phenobarbital acts on GABAA receptors, increasing synaptic inhibition. This has the effect of elevating seizure threshold and reducing the spread of seizure activity from a seizure focus. Phenobarbital may also inhibit calcium channels, resulting in a decrease in excitatory transmitter release."
786,"Cyclizine is used in the prevention and treatment of nausea, vomiting, and dizziness associated with motion sickness. Additionally, it has been used in the management of vertigo in diseases affecting the vestibular apparatus. The vomiting centre possesses neurons which are rich in muscarinic cholinergic and histamine containing synapses. These types of neurons are especially involved in transmission from the vestibular apparatus to the vomiting centre. Motion sickness principally involves overstimulation of these pathways due to various sensory stimuli."
787,"Used in the management of anxiety and in the treatment of muscle spasm.A non-benzodiazepine that is used in the management of anxiety. It has been suggested for use in the treatment of muscle spasm.Chlormezanone is a non-benzodiazepine muscle relaxant. It was discontinued worldwide in 1996 by its manufacturer due to confirmed serious and rare cutaneous reactions (toxic epidermal necrolysis).Chlormezanone binds to central benzodiazepine receptors which interact allosterically with GABA receptors. This potentiates the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, increasing the inhibition of the ascending reticular activating system and blocking the cortical and limbic arousal that occurs following stimulation of the reticular pathways."
788,"For the treatment of hypertension.Rescinnamine is an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor used as an antihypertensive drug. Rescinnamine inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. By inhibiting angiotensin II, aldosterone reabsorption is decreased as well as vasoconstriction. As angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor and a negative-feedback mediator for renin activity, lower concentrations result in a decrease in blood pressure and stimulation of baroreceptor reflex mechanisms, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion."
789,"Also used as a component of various chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of cervical cancer, as well as in conjunction with surgery and/or radiation therapy in the treatment of various soft tissue sarcomas. small cell lung cancer, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.Ifosfamide is a chemotherapeutic agent chemically related to the nitrogen mustards and a synthetic analog of cyclophosphamide. It is active as an alkylating agent and an immunosuppressive agent.Ifosfamide requires activation by microsomal liver enzymes to active metabolites in order to exert its cytotoxic effects. The stable urinary metabolite, 4-carboxyifosfamide, is formed upon opening of the ring. These urinary metabolites have not been found to be cytotoxic."
790,"It is used in the treatment of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Propafenone has local anesthetic activity approximately equal to procaine.The electrophysiological effect of propafenone manifests itself in a reduction of upstroke velocity (Phase 0) of the monophasic action potential. In Purkinje fibers, and to a lesser extent myocardial fibers, propafenone reduces the fast inward current carried by sodium ions, which is responsible for the drugs antiarrhythmic actions. Diastolic excitability threshold is increased and effective refractory period prolonged. Propafenone reduces spontaneous automaticity and depresses triggered activity."
791,"For management of dyspepsia, heartburn, epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting.A specific blocker of dopamine receptors. It speeds gastrointestinal peristalsis, causes prolactin release, and is used as antiemetic and tool in the study of dopaminergic mechanisms.Domperidone is a specific blocker of dopamine receptors. It speeds gastrointestinal peristalsis, causes prolactin release, and is used as antiemetic and tool in the study of dopaminergic mechanisms.Domperidone acts as a gastrointestinal emptying (delayed) adjunct and peristaltic stimulant. Domperidone facilitates gastric emptying and decreases small bowel transit time by increasing esophageal and gastric peristalsis and by lowering esophageal sphincter pressure. Antiemetic: The antiemetic properties of domperidone are related to its dopamine receptor blocking activity at both the chemoreceptor trigger zone and at the gastric level."
792,"In females, for palliation of androgenresponsive recurrent mammary cancer in women who are more than one year but less than five years postmenopausal.An anabolic steroid that has been used in the treatment of male hypogonadism, delayed puberty in males, and in the treatment of breast neoplasms in women.Fluoxymesterone is a synthetic androgen, or male hormone, similar to testosterone. Fluoxymesterone works by attaching itself to androgen receptors; this causes it to interact with the parts of the cell involved in the making of proteins. It may cause an increase in the synthesis of some proteins or a decrease in the synthesis of others. Like testosterone and other androgenic hormones, fluoxymesterone binds to the androgen receptor. It produces retention of nitrogen, sodium, potassium, and phosphorus; increases protein anabolism; decreases amino acid catabolism and decreased urinary excretion of calcium."
793,"Desflurane is indicated for the induction and maintenance of anesthesia in adults, as well as the maintenance of anesthesia in pediatric patients.Desflurane, or I-653, a a volatile anesthetic that is more rapidly cleared and less metabolized than previous inhaled anesthetics such as , , , or .. It was developed in the late 1980s out of a need for a more rapidly acting and rapidly cleared inhaled anesthetic. Studies of other halogenated inhalational anesthetics have shown that the lipid bilayer spreads out more thinly as the anesthetic incorporates into the bilayer. However, the anesthetic does not bind to lipid heads or acyl chains of hydrocarbons in the bilayer. By incorporating into the lipid bilayer, anesthetics may introduce disorder in the lipids, leading to some indirect effect on ion channels."
794,"In oral and parenteral formulations, clindamycin is indicated for the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria, as well as susceptible staphylococci, streptococci, and pneumococci. Clindamycin is used for antimicrobial prophylaxis against _Viridans_ group streptococcal infections in susceptible patients undergoing oral, dental, or upper respiratory surgery, and may be used for prophylaxis against bacterial endocarditis in penicillin-allergic patients at high risk of these infections.Clindamycin is a semi-synthetic lincosamide antibiotic used in the treatment of a variety of serious infections due to susceptible microorganisms as well as topically for acne vulgaris. Clindamycin is derived from, and has largely replaced, , a naturally occurring lincosamide and the eponymous member of this antibiotic class, due to its improved properties over the parent compound. Because of the associated risks, clindamycin should be reserved for serious infections for which the use of less toxic antimicrobial agents are inappropriate. The mechanism through which topical clindamycin treats acne vulgaris is unclear, but may be related to its activity against _Propionibacterium acnes_, a bacteria that has been associated with acne."
795,"For the management of obesity including weight loss and maintenance of weight loss in patients on a reduced calorie dietDexfenfluramine, also marketed under the name Redux, is a serotoninergic anorectic drug. For a fairly limited time during the middle of the nineties, the US FDA had approved it for use in managing weight loss. However, following multiple concerns about the cardiovascular side-effects of the drug, such approval was withdrawn.Used to treat diabetes and obesity, Dexfenfluramine decreases caloric intake by increasing serotonin levels in the brain&rsquo;s synapses. Dexfenfluramine acts as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. This causes inhbition of serotonin reuptake."
796,"For the treatment of moderate-to-severe pain.An opioid analgesic with actions and uses similar to those of morphine, apart from an absence of cough suppressant activity. It is used in the treatment of moderate to severe pain, including pain in obstetrics. Opioid analgesics exert their principal pharmacologic effects on the CNS and the gastrointestinal tract. The mechanism of respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation.Oxymorphone interacts predominantly with the opioid mu-receptor. These mu-binding sites are discretely distributed in the human brain, with high densities in the posterior amygdala, hypothalamus, thalamus, nucleus caudatus, putamen, and certain cortical areas."
797,"For the management of hypertension and ventricular premature beats in adults.A cardioselective beta-adrenergic antagonist with little effect on the bronchial receptors. The drug has stabilizing and quinidine-like effects on cardiac rhythm as well as weak inherent sympathomimetic action.Acebutolol is a cardioselective, beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agent, which possesses mild intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) in its therapeutically effective dose range. In general, beta-blockers reduce the work the heart has to do and allow it to beat more regularly. Acebutolol has less antagonistic effects on peripheral vascular &szlig;2-receptors at rest and after epinephrine stimulation than nonselective beta-antagonists. Activation of &beta;1-receptors by epinephrine increases the heart rate and the blood pressure, and the heart consumes more oxygen."
798,"Brinzolamide is a highly specific, non-competitive, reversible carbonic anhydrase II (CA-II) inhibitor indicated to reduce ocular pressure in patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma. Although systemic anti-carbonic anhydrase (CA) therapy has been used for almost 50 years with varying degrees of success, systemic administration results in an increase in incidences of adverse effects. Brinzolamide was approved by the FDA in 1998 as a standalone product and in 2013 as a combination product with brimonidine tartrate. Among patients who were naive to IOP therapy (10 patients), the efficacy of brinzolamide was similar to that seen previously in adults, with mean IOP reductions from baseline ranging up to 5 mmHg. Among patients who were on topical IOP-lowering medicinal products (22 patients), mean IOP increased slightly from baseline in the brinzolamide group.Brinzolamide is a highly specific, reversible, non-competitive inhibitor of carbonic anhydrases (CA), the enzymes catalyzing the reversible reaction of water and carbon dioxide (CO2) to form bicarbonate ions."
799,"In New Zealand and America, flecainide is indicated to prevent supraventricular arrhythmias and ventricular arrhythmias. It is used to prevent supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, as well as paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and flutter. Flecainide was granted FDA approval on 31 October 1985.Flecainide inhibits the action of sodium and potassium ion channels in the heart, raising the threshold for depolarization and correcting arrhythmias. This blockade also shortens the duration of action potentials through the Purkinjie fibers. Flecainide also prevents delayed rectifier potassium channels from opening, lengthening the action potential through ventricular and atrial muscle fibers."
800,"Estramustine is a combination of estradiol with nitrogen mustard. In vivo, the nitrogen-mustard moiety becomes active and participates in alkylation of DNA or other cellular components. This causes DNA damage in rapidly dividing cancerous cells leading to cell death and ideally, tumor shrinkage.Estramustine is a derivative of estradiol with a nitrogen mustard moiety. This gives it alkylating properties. In vivo, the nitrogen mustard component is active and can alklyate DNA and other cellular components (such as tubulin components) of rapidly dividing cells."
801,"ATII increases blood pressure using a number of mechanisms. ADH stimulates further water reabsorption from the kidneys via insertion of aquaporin-2 channels on the apical surface of cells of the DCT and collecting tubules. ACE inhibitors inhibit the rapid conversion of ATI to ATII and antagonize RAAS-induced increases in blood pressure. Inhibiting the deactivation of bradykinin increases bradykinin levels and may sustain its effects by causing increased vasodilation and decreased blood pressure.There are two isoforms of ACE: the somatic isoform, which exists as a glycoprotein comprised of a single polypeptide chain of 1277; and the testicular isoform, which has a lower molecular mass and is thought to play a role in sperm maturation and binding of sperm to the oviduct epithelium. Captopril, one of the few ACE inhibitors that is not a prodrug, competes with ATI for binding to ACE and inhibits and enzymatic proteolysis of ATI to ATII."
802,"In addition to zopiclone's benzodiazepine pharmacological properties it also has some barbiturate-like properties.Zopiclone is a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic from the pyrazolopyrimidine class and is indicated for the short-term treatment of insomnia. While Zopiclone is a hypnotic agent with a chemical structure unrelated to benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or other drugs with known hypnotic properties, it interacts with the gamma-aminobutyric acid-benzodiazepine (GABABZ) receptor complex. Subunit modulation of the GABABZ receptor chloride channel macromolecular complex is hypothesized to be responsible for some of the pharmacological properties of benzodiazepines, which include sedative, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, and anticonvulsive effects in animal models. Zopiclone binds selectively to the brain alpha subunit of the GABA A omega-1 receptor.Zopiclone exerts its action by binding on the benzodiazepine receptor complex and modulation of the GABABZ receptor chloride channel macromolecular complex. Both zopiclone and benzodiazepines act indiscriminately at the benzodiazepine binding site on α1, α2, α3 and α5 GABAA containing receptors as full agonists causing an enhancement of the inhibitory actions of GABA to produce the therapeutic (hypnotic and anxiolytic) and adverse effects of zopiclone."
803,"It inhibits prolactin secretion and may be used to treat dysfunctions associated with hyperprolactinemia. Bromocriptine is also indicated for the management of signs and symptoms of Parkinsonian Syndrome, as well as the treatment of acromegaly. The dopaminergic D2 receptor subfamily consists of D, D and D subreceptors, which are associated with improvement of symptoms of movement disorders. Thus, agonist activity specific for D2 subfamily receptors, primarily D and D receptor subtypes, are the primary targets of dopaminergic antiparkinsonian agents. In lactotrophs, stimulation of dopamine D receptor causes inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, which decreases intracellular cAMP concentrations and blocks IP3-dependent release of Ca from intracellular stores."
804,"Specifically, it interacts with bacterial RNA polymerase but does not inhibit the mammalian enzyme.Rifapentine is an antibiotic that inhibits DNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity in susceptible cells. It is bactericidal and has a very broad spectrum of activity against most gram-positive and gram-negative organisms (including Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and specifically Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Rifampin is well absorbed when taken orally and is distributed widely in body tissues and fluids, including the CSF. Rifapentine inhibits DNA-dependent RNA polymerase in susceptible strains of M. tuberculosis. Rifapentine acts via the inhibition of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, leading to a suppression of RNA synthesis and cell death."
805,"Levetiracetam is also available as an orally dissolvable tablet that is indicated as an adjunct in the treatment of partial onset seizures in patients with epilepsy who are 4 years of age and older and weigh more than 20kg.Levetiracetam is a drug within the pyrrolidine class that is used to treat various types of seizures stemming from epileptic disorders. It was first approved for use in the United States in 1999 and is structurally and mechanistically unrelated to other anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). Levetiracetam possesses a wide therapeutic index and little-to-no potential to produce, or be subject to, pharmacokinetic interactions - these characteristics make it a desirable choice over other AEDs, a class of drugs notorious for having generally narrow therapeutic indexes and a propensity for involvement in drug interactions.Levetiracetam appears to prevent seizure activity via the selective inhibition of hypersynchronized epileptiform burst firing without affecting normal neuronal transmission, though the exact mechanism through which this occurs is unclear. Anti-epileptic drugs, including levetiracetam, may increase the risk of suicidal ideation or behaviour - patients taking levetiracetam should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and behavioural abnormalities.The exact mechanism through which levetiracetam exerts its anti-epileptic effects is unclear, but is thought to be unique amongst other anti-epileptic medications. SV2A is a membrane-bound protein that is found on synaptic vesicles and is ubiquitous throughout the CNS - it appears to play a role in vesicle exocytosis and in the modulation of synaptic transmission by increasing the available amount of secretory vesicles available for neurotransmission."
806,"Another product formulated with  is indicated to treat hypertension.Nadolol is a nonselective beta adrenal receptor blocker that is used to lower blood pressure. Nadolol was granted FDA approval on 10 December 1979.Nadolol is a nonselective beta adrenal receptor blocker that is used to lower blood pressure. Patients taking nadolol should not aburptly stop taking it as this may lead to exacerbation of ischemic heart disease.Although nadolol is described as a non selective beta blocker, it does not interact with beta 3 adrenal receptors. Antagonism of beta-2 adrenoceptors in the smooth muscle cells of the vasculature inhibits their relaxation, leading to an increase in peripheral vascular resistance and reducing the risk of severe hypotension. Antagonism of beta-2 adrenoceptors in the liver and skeletal muscle inhibits glycogenolysis, in the lungs prevents bronchodilation, and in the pancrease inhibits insulin release."
807,"For the treatment of secondary (chronic) progressive, progressive relapsing, or worsening relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosisAn anthracenedione-derived antineoplastic agent.Mitoxantrone has been shown in vitro to inhibit B cell, T cell, and macrophage proliferation and impair antigen presentation, as well as the secretion of interferon gamma, TNFa, and IL-2.Mitoxantrone, a DNA-reactive agent that intercalates into deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) through hydrogen bonding, causes crosslinks and strand breaks. Mitoxantrone also interferes with ribonucleic acid (RNA) and is a potent inhibitor of topoisomerase II, an enzyme responsible for uncoiling and repairing damaged DNA. It has a cytocidal effect on both proliferating and nonproliferating cultured human cells, suggesting lack of cell cycle phase specificity."
808,"For the complete or partial reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines in cases where general anesthesia has been induced and/or maintained with benzodiazepines, and where sedation has been produced with benzodiazepines for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Also for the management of benzodiazepine overdose as an adjunct for appropriate supportive and symptomatic measures.Fumazenil is an imidazobenzodiazepine derivative and a potent benzodiazepine receptor antagonist that competitively inhibits the activity at the benzodiazepine recognition site on the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex, thereby reversing the effects of benzodiazepine on the central nervous system.Flumazenil antagonizes the CNS effects produced by benzodiazepines, but does not antagonize the central nervous system effects of drugs affecting GABA-ergic neurons by means other than the benzodiazepine receptor (including ethanol, barbiturates, or general anesthetics) and does not reverse the effects of opioids.Flumazenil, an imidazobenzodiazepine derivative, is a benzodiazepine antagonist. It competitively inhibits the benzodiazepine binding site on the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex. Flumazenil is a weak partial agonist in some animal models of activity, but has little or no agonist activity in man."
809,Also used in combination with other agents as secondary therapy for the treatment of refractory or relapsed Hodgkin's disease.An alkylating agent of value against both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.Lomustine is an alkylating agent of the nitrosourea type. Lomustine and its metabolites interferes with the function of DNA and RNA. It is cell cycle&ndash;phase nonspecific. Cancers form when some cells within the body multiply uncontrollably and abnormally. These cells then spread and destroy nearby tissues.
810,"For the treatment of adults with the following infections caused by susceptible strains microorganisms: community-acquired pneumonia (caused by Chlamydia pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, or Streptococcus pneumoniae) and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (caused by Chlamydia pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, or Streptococcus pneumoniae).Sparfloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic indicated for bacterial infections. Sparfloxacin exerts its antibacterial activity by inhibiting DNA gyrase, a bacterial topoisomerase. Sparfloxacin has in vitro activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms. Quinolones may, therefore, be active against bacteria resistant to (beta)-lactam antibiotics. In vitro tests show that the combination of sparfloxacin and rifampin is antagonistic against Staphylococcus aureus.The bactericidal action of sparfloxacin results from inhibition of the enzymes topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV, which are required for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination."
811,"It is similar to morphine with respect to analgesic potency and onset and duration of action. The narcotic antagonist activity is greater than that of pentazocine.Dezocine is a opioid analgesic drug of mixed agonist-antagonist type. It binds with stereospecific receptors at many sites within the central nervous system (CNS) to alter processes affecting both the perception of pain and the emotional response to pain. At least 2 of these types of receptors (mu and kappa) mediate analgesia. Mu receptors are widely distributed throughout the CNS, especially in the limbic system (frontal cortex, temporal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus), thalamus, striatum, hypothalamus, and midbrain as well as laminae I, II, IV, and V of the dorsal horn in the spinal cord."
812,"Also for the treatment of pharyngitis and tonsillitis caused by susceptible Streptococcus pyogenes, as well as respiratory tract infections including acute maxillary sinusitis, acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, mild to moderate community-acquired pneuomia, Legionnaires' disease, and pertussis. Other indications include treatment of uncomplicated skin or skin structure infections, helicobacter pylori infection, duodenal ulcer disease, bartonella infections, early Lyme disease, and encephalitis caused by Toxoplasma gondii (in HIV infected patients in conjunction with pyrimethamine). Clarithromycin, a semisynthetic macrolide antibiotic derived from erythromycin, inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the bacterial 50S ribosomal subunit. Clarithromycin may be bacteriostatic or bactericidal depending on the organism and drug concentration.Clarithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic whose spectrum of activity includes many gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, S. pneumoniae, and S. pyogenes) and gram-negative aerobic bacteria (Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis), many anaerobic bacteria, some mycobacteria, and some other organisms including Mycoplasma, Ureaplasma, Chlamydia, Toxoplasma, and Borrelia. Other aerobic bacteria that clarithromycin has activity against include C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae."
813,"Organisms that are generally susceptible to ceftriaxone include S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes (group A beta-hemolytic streptococci), coagulase-negative staphylococci, Some Enterobacter spp, H. influenzae, N. gonorrhoeae, P. mirabilis, E. coli, Klebsiella spp, M. catarrhalis, B. burgdorferi, and some oral anaerobes. Ceftriaxone has broader and stronger gram-negative coverage then first or second-generation cephalosporins, but worse activity against methicillin-susceptible S.aureus. Ceftriaxone is a commonly used antimicrobial due to its good activity against multi-drug resistant Enterobacteriaceae, its relatively safe adverse effect profile, and its long half-life which allows for the convenience of daily or twice-daily dosing.Ceftriaxone is a cephalosporin/cephamycin beta-lactam antibiotic used in the treatment of bacterial infections caused by susceptible, usually gram-positive, organisms. The bactericidal activity of ceftriaxone results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis and is mediated through ceftriaxone binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Ceftriaxone works by inhibiting the mucopeptide synthesis in the bacterial cell wall."
814,"Antizol is indicated as an antidote for ethylene glycol (such as antifreeze) or methanol poisoning, or for use in suspected ethylene glycol or methanol ingestion, either alone or in combination with hemodialysisFomepizole is used as an antidote in confirmed or suspected methanol or ethylene glycol poisoning. Fomepizole is a competitive inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase, the enzyme that catalyzes the initial steps in the metabolism of ethylene glycol and methanol to their toxic metabolites.Fomepizole is a competitive inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase, the enzyme that catalyzes the initial steps in the metabolism of ethylene glycol and methanol to their toxic metabolites. Ethylene glycol is first metabolized to glycoaldehyde which then undergoes further oxidation to glycolate, glyoxylate, and oxalate. Glycolate and oxalate are primarily responsible for metabolic acidosis and renal damage seen in ethylene glycol toxicity. It is formic acid that is primarily responsible for the metabolic acidosis and visual disturbances that are associated with methanol poisoning.Antizol (fomepizole) is a competitive inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase."
815,"It is used as an antiarrhythmic, antihypertensive, and antiglaucoma agent.Metipranolol is a beta1 and beta2 (non-selective) adrenergic receptor-blocking agent that does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct myocardial depressant, or local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) activity. Metipranolol is indicated in the treatment of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of glaucomatous visual field loss and optic nerve damage. It has no significant intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and has only weak local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) and myocardial depressant activity. It appears that the ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agents reduce aqueous humor production, as demonstrated by tonography and fluorophotometry."
816,"For the short-term management of insomnia characterized by difficulty in falling asleep, frequent nocturnal awakenings, and/or early morning awakenings.A benzodiazepine with anticonvulsant, hypnotic, and muscle relaxant properties. It has been shown in some cases to be more potent than diazepam or nitrazepam.Estazolam, a triazolobenzodiazepine derivative, is an oral hypnotic agent with anticonvulsant, hypnotic, and muscle relaxant properties. It has been shown in some cases to be more potent than diazepam or nitrazepam.Benzodiazepines bind nonspecifically to benzodiazepine receptors, which affects affects muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, motor coordination, and memory. As benzodiazepine receptors are thought to be coupled to gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptors, this enhances the effects GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA receptor. Binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA to the site opens the chloride channel, resulting in a hyperpolarized cell membrane that prevents further excitation of the cell."
817,"In the treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia, alpha-blockers such as  and  are also used. Compared to alpha-blockers that focus on providing the rapid relief of symptoms, 5α-reductase inhibitors aim to target the underlying disease by blocking the effects of the primary androgen involved in benign prostate hyperplasia and androgenic alopecia, thus reducing the risk for secondary complications while providing symptom control.Finasteride is an antiandrogenic compound that works by suppressing the production of serum and intraprostatic dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in men via inhibiting the enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of DHT. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, finasteride reduced intraprostatic DHT level by 91.4% but finasteride is not expected to decrease the DHT levels to castrate levels since circulating testosterone is also converted to DHT by the type 1 isoenzyme expressed in other tissues. There is evidence from early clinical observations and controlled studies that finasteride may reduce bleeding of prostatic origin.Finasteride acts as a competitive and specific inhibitor of Type II 5α-reductase, a nuclear-bound steroid intracellular enzyme primarily located in the prostatic stromal cell that converts the androgen testosterone into the more active metabolite, 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). In men with androgenic alopecia, the mechanism of action has not been fully determined, but finasteride has shown to decrease scalp DHT concentration to the levels found in the hairy scalp, reduce serum DHT, increase hair regrowth, and slow hair loss."
818,"Anastrozole is indicated as adjunct therapy in the treatment of hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer in postmenopausal women, and as a first-line treatment for hormone receptor-positive (or hormone receptor-unknown) locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Anastrozole is a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (AI), similar to , used to decrease circulating estrogen levels in the treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogen-responsive breast cancer. Anastrozole has a relatively long duration of action allowing for once daily dosing - serum estradiol is reduced by approximately 70% within 24 hours of beginning therapy with 1mg once daily, and levels remain suppressed for up to 6 days following cessation of therapy. The incidence of ischemic cardiovascular events was increased during anastrozole therapy and patients with pre-existing ischemic heart disease should consider the risks and benefits of anastrozole before beginning therapy. In postmenopausal women, estrogen is primarily derived from the conversion of adrenally-produced androgens into estrogens by the aromatase enzyme - by competitively inhibiting the biosynthesis of estrogen at these enzymes, anastrozole effectively suppresses circulating estrogen levels and, subsequently, the growth of hormone receptor-positive tumours."
819,"For use, along with appropriate supportive measures, for the management of the fulminant hypermetabolism of skeletal muscle characteristic of malignant hyperthermia crises in patients of all ages. Also used preoperatively, and sometimes postoperatively, to prevent or attenuate the development of clinical and laboratory signs of malignant hyperthermia in individuals judged to be malignant hyperthermia susceptible.Chemically, dantrolene is a hydantoin derivative, but does not exhibit antiepileptic activity like other hydantoin derivates such as phenytoin.Dantrolene is classified as a direct-acting skeletal muscle relaxant. It is currently the only specific and effective treatment for malignant hyperthermia. In skeletal muscle, Dantrium dissociates excitation-contraction coupling, probably by interfering with the release of Ca2+from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In selected humans, it has been postulated that &ldquo;triggering agents&rdquo; (e.g.,general anesthetics and depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents) produce a change within the cell which results in an elevated myoplasmic calcium."
820,"Rifaximin has multiple indications by the FDA: for the treatment of patients (≥12 years of age) with traveller's diarrhea caused by noninvasive strains of Escherichia coli; for the reduction of overt hepatic encephalopathy recurrence in patients ≥18 years of age; and in May 2015 it was approved for irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) treatment in adult men and women. Rifaximin is a semisynthetic, rifamycin-based non-systemic antibiotic, meaning that the drug will not pass the gastrointestinal wall into the circulation as is common for other types of orally administered antibiotics. This non-systemic property of the drug is due to the addition of a pyridoimidazole ring, which renders it non-absorbable. Other studies have also shown rifaximin to be an pregnane X receptor (PXR) activator. As PXR is responsible for inhibiting the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-kappa B (NF-κB) and is inhibited in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rifaximin was proven to be effective for the treatment of IBS-D.Rifaximin acts by inhibiting RNA synthesis in susceptible bacteria by binding to the beta-subunit of bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-dependent ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase enzyme."
821,"Ketamine can be used for induction of anesthesia prior other general anesthetic agents and as a supplement of low potency agents. Reports have indicated a potential use of ketamine as a therapeutic tool for the management of depression when administered in lower doses. These reports have increased the interest for ketamine in this area and several clinical trials are launched for this indication.Ketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist with a potent anesthetic effect. It started being used for veterinary purposes in Belgium and in 1964 was proven that compared to PCP, it produced minor hallucinogenic effects and shorter psychotomimetic effects. The anesthetic state produced by Ketamine has been termed as ""dissociative anesthesia"" in that it appears to selectively interrupt association pathways of the brain before producing somesthetic sensory blockade."
822,"In addition, a delayed-release capsule formulation of budesonide is indicated to reduce proteinuria in adults with IgA nephropathy at risk of rapid disease progression. Budesonide is indicated to treat eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE): For this indication, it is only approved for use in adults in Europe  while it is approved for short-term use (12 weeks) in patients 11 years of age and older in the US.Budesonide is a glucocorticoid that is a mix of the 22R and 22S epimer used to treat inflammatory conditions of the lungs and intestines such as asthma, COPD, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. Budesonide was granted FDA approval on 14 February 1994. It is also available in a combination product with .Budesonide is a glucocorticoid used to treat respiratory and digestive conditions by reducing inflammation. It has a wide therapeutic index, as dosing varies highly from patient to patient."
823,"For the treatment of bronchospasm due to asthma, emphysema and chronic bronchitis.Aminophylline is a drug combination that contains theophylline and ethylenediamine in a 2:1 ratio. Once in the body, theophylline is released and acts as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, adenosine receptor blocker, and histone deacetylase activator. The majority of aminophylline medications are discontinued and the remaining medications on the market are in short supply.Aminophylline is the ethylenediamine salt of theophylline. Theophylline stimulates the CNS, skeletal muscles, and cardiac muscle. It relaxes certain smooth muscles in the bronchi, produces diuresis, and causes an increase in gastric secretion.Aminophylline is the ethylenediamine salt of theophylline."
824,"In addition, it may be used for the management of acute manic or mixed episodes in patients with bipolar I disorder, as a monotherapy or combined with other drugs. In addition to the above indications, quetiapine is used in combination with antidepressant drugs for the treatment of major depression. It is well-tolerated and a suitable option for some patients with high sensitivity to other drugs, such as  and .Quetiapine improves the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia and major depression by acting on various neurotransmitter receptors, such as the serotonin and dopamine receptors. In addition, this drug is not indicated for the treatment of psychosis related to dementia due to an increased death rate in elderly patients taking this drug.Although the mechanism of action of quetiapine is not fully understood, several proposed mechanisms exist. In bipolar depression and major depression, quetiapine's actions may be attributed to the binding of this drug or its metabolite to the norepinephrine transporter."
825,"Additionally, enoxaparin is indicated for the inpatient treatment of DVT with or without pulmonary embolism and the treatment of outpatient DVT without pulmonary embolism. Enoxaparin increases Thrombin Time (TT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), preventing and reducing thromboembolic complications such as DVT, pulmonary embolism, and ischemic cardiac complications. Administered at 1.5 mg/kg subcutaneously in a pharmacodynamic study, enoxaparin led to a higher ratio of anti-Factor Xa to anti-Factor IIa activity (mean ±SD, 14.0±3.1) (based on areas under anti-Factor activity versus time curves) when compared to that of heparin (mean ±SD, 1.22±0.13). In pregnant women with prosthetic mechanic heart valves, the risk of thromboembolism is increased. Enoxaparin binds to antithrombin III, a serine protease inhibitor, forming a complex that irreversibly inactivates factor Xa, which is frequently used to monitor anticoagulation in the clinical setting."
826,"For the treatment and management of opiate dependence. It is sometimes used to treat severe pain in terminal patients.Levacetylmethadol is a narcotic analgesic with a long onset and duration of action. It is used mainly in the treatment of narcotic dependence. Levacetylmethadol was withdrawn from use in the European Union due to its high risk of QT interval prolongation. The production of levacetylmethadol in the US has ceased as well.Levomethadyl acetate (also known as LAAM) is a synthetic synthetic opioid analgesic with multiple actions quantitatively similar to those as morphine, the most prominent of which involve the central nervous system and organs composed of smooth muscle."
827,"Encainide is a class Ic antiarrhythmic agent which was used for management of irregular heartbeats, such as atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. All drug products containing encainide hydrochloride. Encainide hydrochloride, formerly marketed as Enkaid capsules, was associated with increased death rates in patients who had asymptomatic heart rhythm abnormalities after a recent heart attack. The manufacturer of Enkaid capsules voluntarily withdrew the product from the US market on December 16, 1991.Used to treat irregular heartbeats, encainide decreases excitability, conduction velocity, and automaticity as a result of slowed atrial, atrioventricular (AV) nodal, His-Purkinje, and intraventricular conduction. It causes a slight but significant prolongation of refractory periods in these tissues."
828,"It is available as an intravenous solution for injection and the newer formulation contains albumin-bound paclitaxel marketed under the brand name Abraxane.Paclitaxel is a taxoid antineoplastic agent indicated as first-line and subsequent therapy for the treatment of advanced carcinoma of the ovary, and other various cancers including breast cancer. This stability results in the inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic cellular functions. In addition, paclitaxel induces abnormal arrays or ""bundles"" of microtubules throughout the cell cycle and multiple asters of microtubules during mitosis.Paclitaxel interferes with the normal function of microtubule growth. Whereas drugs like colchicine cause the depolymerization of microtubules in vivo, paclitaxel arrests their function by having the opposite effect; it hyper-stabilizes their structure. This destroys the cell's ability to use its cytoskeleton in a flexible manner."
829,"For treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)In 2005, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) withdrew approval for pemoline. In March 2005, Abbott Laboratories (Cylert marketer) had discontinued the production of Cylert arguing economic reasons.Pemoline belongs to the group of medicines called central nervous system (CNS) stimulants. It is used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Pemoline stimulates the brain, probably by affecting neurotransmitters, the chemicals in the brain that nerves use to communicate with each other."
830,"Like other protease inhibitors, saquinavir has a propensity for participating in drug interactions - use caution when administering saquinavir to patients maintained on other pharmaceutical agents as pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions are common. Careful and regular monitoring of patient bloodwork is recommended, as saquinavir has been associated with the development of metabolic complications (e.g. diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia) and worsening of pre-existing liver disease.The HIV lifecycle is comprised of 3 distinct stages: assembly, involving creation and packaging of essential viral components; budding, wherein the viral particle crosses the host cell plasma membrane and forms a lipid envelope; and maturation, wherein the viral particle alters its structure and becomes infectious. The HIV-1 protease enzyme, a dimeric aspartic protease, is the enzyme responsible for cleaving the Gag polyprotein and thus plays a critical role in many aspects of the HIV viral lifecycle. Its design is based on the ""peptidomimetic"" principle, wherein the molecule contains a hydroxyethylene scaffold that mimics the normal peptide linkage (cleaved by HIV protease) but which itself cannot be cleaved. By preventing HIV-1 protease activity, and thus the proteolysis of the Gag polyprotein, saquinavir results in the production of immature, non-infectious viral particles."
831,"Intravenous metoclopramide facilitates intubation of the small bowel and stimulates gastric emptying and barium flow in patients who require radiological examination of the stomach or small intestine. Metoclopramide is a dopamine antagonist used to treat nausea and vomiting that may be associated with diabetic gastroparesis in addition to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). It is available in the oral tablet form or in solution, and can also be administered through the intravenous route. It also exerts effects on the area postrema of the brain, preventing and relieving the symptoms of nausea and vomiting. Dopamine exerts relaxant effect on the gastrointestinal tract through binding to muscular D2 receptors."
832,"Dexamethasone and  otic suspension is indicated for bacterial infections with inflammation in acute otitis media and acute otitis externa. Intramuscular and intravenous injections are indicated for a number of endocrine, rheumatic, collagen, dermatologic, allergic, ophthalmic, gastrointestinal, respiratory, hematologic, neoplastic, edematous, and other conditions. Dexamethasone was granted FDA approval on 30 October 1958. Corticosteroids have a wide therapeutic window as patients may require doses that are multiples of what the body naturally produces. Lower doses of corticosteroids provide an anti-inflammatory effect, while higher doses are immunosuppressive."
833,"Levodopa on its own is formulated as an oral inhalation powder indicated for intermittent treatment of off episodes in Parkinson's patients who are already being treated with carbidopa and levodopa. Levodopa is most commonly formulated as an oral tablet with a peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor indicated for treatment of Parkinson's disease, post-encephalitic parkinsonism, and symptomatic parkinsonism following carbon monoxide intoxication or manganese intoxication.Levodopa is a prodrug of dopamine that is administered to patients with Parkinson's due to its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Levodopa can be metabolised to dopamine on either side of the blood-brain barrier and so it is generally administered with a dopa decarboxylase inhibitor like carbidopa to prevent metabolism until after it has crossed the blood-brain barrier. Once past the blood-brain barrier, levodopa is metabolized to dopamine and supplements the low endogenous levels of dopamine to treat symptoms of Parkinson's. The first developed drug product that was approved by the FDA was a levodopa and carbidopa combined product called Sinemet that was approved on May 2, 1975.Levodopa is able to cross the blood-brain barrier while dopamine is not."
834,"Sevoflurane is three times more potent than , but has lower potency compared to  and . Unlike other volatile anesthetics, sevoflurane has a pleasant odor and does not irritate the airway. Therefore, it can be used for inhalational induction in adults and children for a wide variety of anesthetic procedures.Sevoflurane induces muscle relaxation and reduces sensitivity by altering tissue excitability with a fast onset of action. It has been suggested that inhaled anesthetics enhance inhibitory postsynaptic channel activity by binding GABA and glycine receptors, and inhibit excitatory synaptic channel activity by binding nicotinic acetylcholine, serotonin, and glutamate receptors. This ability to modulate ion channel activity can also regulate cardiac excitability and contractility."
835,"Aripiprazole is indicated for the treatment of acute manic and mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, irritability associated with autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and Tourette's disorder. It is also used as an adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder. Finally, an extended-release, bimonthly injection formulation of aripiprazole is indicated for the treatment of adult schizophrenia and maintenance therapy for adult bipolar I disorder.Aripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic orally indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar I, major depressive disorder, irritability associated with autism, and Tourette's. Aripiprazole exerts its effects through agonism of dopaminergic and 5-HT1A receptors and antagonism of alpha-adrenergic and 5-HT2A receptors. Aripiprazole has no appreciable affinity for cholinergic muscarinic receptors (IC50>1000 nM).The antipsychotic action of aripiprazole is likely due to its partial agonist activity on D2 and 5-HT1A receptors as well as its antagonist activity at 5-HT2A receptors; however, the exact mechanism has not been fully elucidated."
836,"For treatment of psychotic disorders (e.g. schizophrenia) and of acute mania occuring as part of bipolar disorders.Chlorprothixene is a typical antipsychotic drug of the thioxanthene (tricyclic) class. Chlorprothixene exerts strong blocking effects by blocking the 5-HT2 D1, D2, D3, histamine H1, muscarinic and alpha1 adrenergic receptors.Chlorprothixene is a typical antipsychotic drug of the thioxanthine class. It has a low antipsychotic potency (half to 2/3 of chlorpromazine). Chlorprothixene has not thoroughly demonstrated an antidepressant or analgesic effect but it has demonstrated antiemetic effects. It is used in the treatment of nervous, mental, and emotional conditions."
837,"For the long-term intravenous treatment of primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with the scleroderma spectrum of disease in NYHA Class III and Class IV patients who do not respond adequately to conventional therapy.A prostaglandin that is a powerful vasodilator and inhibits platelet aggregation. It is biosynthesized enzymatically from prostaglandin endoperoxides in human vascular tissue. In animals, the vasodilatory effects reduce right and left ventricular afterload and increase cardiac output and stroke volume. Epoprostenol (PGI2) is a member of the family of prostaglandins that is derived from arachidonic acid. The major pharmacological actions of epoprostenol is ultimately inhibition of platelet aggregation."
838,"Gemfibrozil is indicated to treat patients with Types IV and V hyperlipidemia who have elevated serum triglycerides (usually above 2000mg/dL), elevated VLDL cholesterol, fasting chylomicrons, are at risk of developing pancreatitis, and do not adequately respond to dietary restrictions. Gemfibrozil is also indicated to reduce the risk of developing coronary heart disease in patients with Type IIb hyperlipidemia without history or symptoms of coronary heart disease; who do not adequately respond to weight loss, diet, exercise, and other medications; and have low HDL, raised LDL, and raised triglycerides.Gemfibrozil is a fibric acid agent, similar to , used to treat Type IIb, IV, and V hyperlipidemias. Gemfibrozil is not a first line treatment and is prescribed to patients who have not responded adequately to weight loss, diet, exercise, and other medications. This activation leads to increased HDL, apo AI, apo AII, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), inhibition of apo B synthesis, peripheral lipolysis, decreased removal of free fatty acids by the liver, and increased clearance of apoB. The effects on apoB synthesis and clearance decrease VLDL production which also reduce plasma triglyceride levels."
839,"TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. The antidepressant effects of TCAs are thought to be due to an overall increase in serotonergic neurotransmission. Unlabeled indications include panic disorder, chronic pain (e.g. central pain, idiopathic pain disorder, tension headache, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, neuropathic pain), cataplexy and associated narcolepsy, autistic disorder, trichotillomania, onchophagia, stuttering, premature ejaculation, and premenstrual syndrome. Presynaptic receptors are affected: α1 and β1 receptors are sensitized, α2 receptors are desensitized (leading to increased noradrenaline production). Tricyclics are also known as effective analgesics for different types of pain, especially neuropathic or neuralgic pain.Clomipramine is a strong, but not completely selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI), as the active main metabolite desmethyclomipramine acts preferably as an inhibitor of noradrenaline reuptake."
840,"For the treatment of hypertension, and chronic stable angina (classic effort-associated angina).A long-acting, non selective, calcium channel blocker with significant anti-anginal activity. The drug produces significant coronary vasodilation and modest peripheral effects. It has antihypertensive and selective anti-arrhythmia activities and acts as a calmodulin antagonist. It is not related chemically to other calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem hydrochloride, nifedipine and verapamil hydrochloride.Bepridil has inhibitory effects on both the slow calcium (L-type) and fast sodium inward currents in myocardial and vascular smooth muscle, interferes with calcium binding to calmodulin, and blocks both voltage and receptor operated calcium channels. This has been demonstrated in isolated myocardial and vascular smooth muscle preparations in which both the slope of the calcium dose response curve and the maximum calcium-induced inotropic response were significantly reduced by bepridil."
841,"Used to prevent and relieve allergic conditions which cause pruritus (itching) and urticaria (some allergic skin reactions).A phenothiazine derivative that is used as an antipruritic.Trimeprazine (also known as Alimemazine) is a tricyclic antihistamine, similar in structure to the phenothiazine antipsychotics, but differing in the ring-substitution and chain characteristics. It acts as an anti-histamine, a sedative, and an anti-emetic (anti-nausea). Trimeprazine is used principally as an anti-emetic, to prevent motion sickness or as an anti-histamine in combination with other medications in cough and cold preparations. Tricyclic antihistamines are also structurally-related to the tricyclic antidepressants, explaining the antihistaminergic adverse effects of these two drug classes and also the poor tolerability profile of tricyclic H<sub>1</sub>-antihistamines.Trimeprazine competes with free histamine for binding at HA-receptor sites. This antagonizes the effects of histamine on HA-receptors, leading to a reduction of the negative symptoms brought on by histamine HA-receptor binding."
842,"The patient will present changes in its feelings, thoughts, and ability to handle everyday activities. For a mood disorder to be considered as depression, the symptoms should be present for at least two weeks.Isocarboxazid has the formula 1-benzyl-2-(5-methyl-3-isoxazolylcarbonyl)hydrazine-isocarboxazid. It is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. The reduced MAO activity, caused by isocarboxazid, results in an increased concentration of serotonin, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine in storage sites throughout the central nervous system (CNS) and sympathetic nervous system. The increase of one or more monoamines is the basis for the antidepressant activity of MAO inhibitors like isocarboxazid.Isocarboxazid works by irreversibly blocking the action of monoamine oxidases (MAO) in the nervous system."
843,"Docetaxel is indicated as a single agent for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after chemotherapy failure; and with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide as adjuvant treatment of operable node-positive BC. It is also indicated as a single agent for locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after platinum therapy failure; and with cisplatin for unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic untreated NSCLC. Docetaxel binds to microtubules but does not interact with dimeric tubulin. The resulting microtubule/docetaxel complex does not have the ability to disassemble. This adversely affects cell function because the shortening and lengthening of microtubules (termed dynamic instability) is necessary for their function as a transportation highway for the cell."
844,"Iodixanol is a contrast agent during coronary angiography.Iodixanol is a nonionic hydrophilic compound commonly used as a contrast agent during coronary angiography, particularly in individuals with renal dysfunction, as it is believed to be less toxic to the kidneys than most other intravascular contrast agents.Iodixanol is a contrast agent commonly used during coronary angiography, particularly in individuals with renal dysfunction, as it is believed to be less toxic to the kidneys than most other intravascular contrast agents. It is an imaging contrast agent with the same osmolality as blood (290mOsm/kg H20).Organic iodine compounds attenuate x-rays as they pass through the body, thereby allowing the body structures containing iodine to be delineated in contrast to those structures that do not contain iodine. The degree of opacity produced by these compounds is directly proportional to the total amount (concentration and volume) of the iodinated contrast agent in the path of the x-rays. After intravascular administration, iodixanol makes opaque those internal structures in its path of flow, allowing their visualization until significant hemodilution and elimination occur."
845,"It is also indicated for the long-term maintenance of patients with ulcerative colitis in remission.Olsalazine is an aminosalicylate and a prodrug of  (5-aminosalicylic acid, 5-ASA). Olsalazine is used in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.Olsalazine is an anti-inflammatory agent that blocks the production of cyclooxygenase (COX)-derived products of arachidonic acid metabolism. In about 40% of the patients with ulcerative colitis, administration of olsalazine 1g daily was associated with a decrease in whole gut transit time. The two molecules of mesalamine are released to mediate therapeutic effects. Mesalamine may attenuate inflammation by blocking the COX enzyme and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon."
846,"Used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2.Gliquidone is a sulfonylurea drug used to treat diabetes mellitus type 2. In patients with diabetes mellitus, there is a deficiency or absence of a hormone manufactured by the pancreas called insulin. It also promotes the movement of sugar from the blood into the cells in the body which need it. The mechanism of action of gliquidone in lowering blood glucose appears to be dependent on stimulating the release of insulin from functioning pancreatic beta cells, and increasing sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin. Membrane depolarization stimulates calcium ion influx through voltage-sensitive calcium channels."
847,"For the treatment of type 2 diabetes.Mitiglinide is a drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. It may stimulate insulin secretion in beta-cells by closing off ATP dependant potassium ion channels.Mitiglinide belongs to the meglitinide class of blood glucose-lowering drugs. It is approved for use in Japan but has not yet gained FDA approval.Mitiglinide is thought to stimulate insulin secretion by binding to and blocking ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channels (Kir6.2/SUR1 complex, KATP channels) in pancreatic beta-cells. Closure of potassium channels causes depolarization which stimulates calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels. High intracellular calcium subsequently triggers the exocytosis of insulin granules."
848,"Used to treat postpartum haemorrhage and postabortion haemorrhage in patients with uterine atony. An ergot alkaloid with uterine and vascular smooth muscle contractile properties.Ergonovine belongs to the group of medicines known as ergot alkaloids. These medicines are usually given to stop excessive bleeding that sometimes occurs after abortion or a baby is delivered. With usual doses, these contractions precede periods of relaxation; with larger doses, basal uterine tone is elevated and these relaxation periods will be decreased. The sensitivity of the uterus to the oxytocic effect is much greater toward the end of pregnancy."
849,"Dasatinib is also indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients 1 year of age and older with Ph+ CML in chronic phase or newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL in combination with chemotherapy.Dasatinib is an orally available multikinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive leukemias. Also, mutations in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL may lead to relapse during imatinib treatment. It may also cause embryo-fetal toxicity and lead to adverse reactions associated with bone growth and development in pediatric patients.Dasatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with several targets. In patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), the tyrosine kinase activity of BCR-ABL is deregulated, leading to the growth, proliferation and survival of cancerous hematopoietic cells. It has been suggested that dasatinib is able to overcome imatinib resistance caused by BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations because it does not require interaction with some of the residues involved in those mutations."
850,"Indicated in combination with capecitabine for the treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer whose tumors overexpress the human epidermal receptor type 2 (HER2) protein and who have received prior therapy including an anthracycline, a taxane, and trastuzumab.Lapatinib is an anti-cancer drug developed by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) as a treatment for solid tumours such as breast and lung cancer. It was approved by the FDA on March 13, 2007, for use in patients with advanced metastatic breast cancer in conjunction with the chemotherapy drug capecitabine. Lapatinib is a 4-anilinoquinazoline kinase inhibitor of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domains of both epidermal growth factor receptor (HER1/EGFR/ERBB1) and human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2/ERBB2)with a dissociation half-life of &ge;300 minutes. Lapatinib retained significant activity against breast cancer cell lines selected for long-term growth in trastuzumab-containing medium in vitro. These in vitro findings suggest non-cross-resistance between these two agents."
851,"For the relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid responsive dermatose.A nonfluorinated corticosteroid anti-inflammatory agent used topically for dermatoses.Desonide is a synthetic nonfluorinated corticosteroid for topical dermatologic use. The corticosteroids constitute a class of primarily synthetic steroids used topically as anti-inflammatory and antipruritic agents.Like other topical corticosteroids, desonide has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive properties. The drug binds to cytosolic glucocorticoid receptors. This complex migrates to the nucleus and binds to genetic elements on the DNA. This activates and represses various genes."
852,"Sitagliptin is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is not used to treat type 1 diabetes or patients with a history of pancreatitis.Sitagliptin is an oral dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor used in conjunction with diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The effect of this medication leads to glucose dependent increases in insulin and decreases in glucagon to improve control of blood sugar. Sitagliptin was granted FDA approval on October 16, 2006.Sitagliptin inhibits DPP-4 which leads to increased levels of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide(GIP), decreased levels of glucagon, and a stronger insulin response to glucose.Inhibition of DPP-4 by sitagliptin slows DPP-4 mediated inactivation of incretins like GLP-1 and GIP. Incretins are released throughout the day and upregulated in response to meals as part of glucose homeostasis."
853,"Decitabine is indicated for the treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) including all French-American-British subtypes (refractory anemia, refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts, refractory anemia with excess blasts, refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation, and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia), as well as for MDS scored as belonging to the intermediate-1, intermediate-2, or high-risk group in the International Prognostic Scoring System.Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of hematopoietic neoplasms with variable underlying etiology and presentation, including neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. In addition, decitabine can cause fetal harm in pregnant women; effective contraception and avoidance of pregnancy are recommended during treatment with decitabine.Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of hematopoietic neoplasms that manifest in peripheral cytopenias and may eventually progress to secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML). Included in the over 45 genes commonly mutated in MDS patients are those involved in DNA methylation and histone modification, and it is well-established that alteration of the epigenetic landscape is a feature of myeloid leukemias. Decitabine is considered a prodrug, as it requires transport into cells and subsequent phosphorylation by distinct kinases to generate the active molecule 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine-triphosphate, which is incorporated by DNA polymerase during DNA replication. The general hypothesis regarding decitabine's therapeutic efficacy is that the global hypomethylation it induces results in the expression of previously silent tumour suppressor genes."
854,"Also for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis, including oropharyngeal candidiasis refractory to itraconazole and/or fluconazole. Posaconazole is used as an alternative treatment for invasive aspergillosis, Fusarium infections, and zygomycosis in patients who are intolerant of, or whose disease is refractory to, other antifungals.Posaconazole is a triazole antifungal drug that is used to treat invasive infections by Candida species and Aspergillus species in severely immunocompromised patients.Posaconazole is an antifungal agent structurally related to itraconazole. These modifications enhance the potency and spectrum of activity of the drug. This leads to the inhibition of the synthesis of ergosterol, a key component of the fungal cell membrane, and accumulation of methylated sterol precursors. This results in inhibition of fungal cell growth and ultimately, cell death."
855,"Darunavir is a protease inhibitor used with other HIV protease inhibitor drugs as well as  for the effective management of HIV-1 infection. It was initially approved by the FDA in 2006. Darunavir is being studied as a possible treatment for SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus responsible for COVID-19, due to in vitro evidence supporting its ability to combat this infection. When administered with ritonavir in combination antiretroviral therapy, darunavir significantly decreases viral load and increases CD4 cell counts, decreasing the morbidity and mortality of HIV infection.The HIV-1 protease enzyme is necessary for viral precursor protein processing and viral maturation in preparation for infection, and is therefore a target for antiretroviral therapy for HIV. Protease inhibitors are used as a part of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in patients diagnosed with HIV infection."
856,"As an oral extended-release tablet and a once-monthly extended-release suspension for intramuscular injection, paliperidone is indicated for the treatment of adults and adolescents with schizophrenia and in the treatment of schizoaffective disorder in combination with antidepressants or mood stabilizers. Paliperidone is also available in both an every-three-month and twice-yearly extended-release suspension for intramuscular injection for the treatment of schizophrenia.Paliperidone is the primary active metabolite of risperidone. Paliperidone is also active as an antagonist at alpha 1 and alpha 2 adrenergic receptors and H1 histaminergic receptors, which may explain some of the other effects of the drug. The mechanism of action is unknown but it is likely to act via a similar pathway to risperidone.Paliperidone is the major active metabolite of risperidone. The mechanism of action of paliperidone, as with other drugs having efficacy in schizophrenia, is unknown, but it has been proposed that the drug's therapeutic activity in schizophrenia is mediated through a combination of central dopamine Type 2 (D2) and serotonin Type 2 (5HT2A) receptor antagonism."
857,"For these purposes, sunitinib is generally available as an orally administered formulation. Sunitinib inhibits cellular signaling by targeting multiple RTKs. In addition, sunitinib inhibits other RTKs including RET, CSF-1R, and flt3.Sunitinib is an oral, small-molecule, multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor that was approved by the FDA on January 26, 2006. Sunitinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases (>80 kinases) and was identified as an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRa and PDGFRb), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor Type 1 (CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET). Sunitinib inhibition of the activity of these RTKs has been demonstrated in biochemical and cellular assays, and inhibition of function has been demonstrated in cell proliferation assays."
858,"Arformoterol is indicated in the maintenance treatment of bronchoconstriction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema.Arformoterol is a bronchodilator. It works by relaxing muscles in the airways to improve breathing. Arformoterol inhalation is used to prevent bronchoconstriction in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. The use of arformoterol is pending revision due to safety concerns in regards to an increased risk of severe exacerbation of asthma symptoms, leading to hospitalization as well as death in some patients using long-acting beta agonists for the treatment of asthma.Arformoterol, the active (R,R)-enantiomer of formoterol, is a selective long-acting β2-adrenergic receptor agonist (beta2-agonist) that has two-fold greater potency than racemic formoterol (which contains both the (S,S) and (R,R)-enantiomers). Increased intracellular cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of the release of proinflammatory mediators from cells, especially from mast cells."
859,"A combination product with isosorbide dinitrate is indicated as an adjunct therapy in the treatment of heart failure.Originally developed in the 1950s as a malaria treatment, hydralazine showed antihypertensive ability and was soon repurposed. Hydralazine has a short duration of action of 2-6h. This drug has a wide therapeutic window, as patients can tolerate doses of up to 300mg. The interference with calcium transport may be by preventing influx of calcium into cells, preventing calcium release from intracellular compartments, directly acting on actin and myosin, or a combination of these actions. This decrease in vascular resistance leads to increased heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output."
860,"Exenatide is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. It activates the GLP-1 receptor and increases insulin secretion, decreases glucagon secretion, and slows gastric emptying to improve glycemic control. Bydureon, the brand name product of extended-release exenatide in an injectable suspension, was discontinued in 2021. Bydureon BCise, an auto-injector extended-release formulation, remains available.When patients take exenatide the body's natural response to glucose is modulated. These effects work synergistically to improve glycemic control by reducing the likelihood of hyper and hypoglycemia."
861,"It is derived from amylin, a hormone that is released into the bloodstream, in a similar pattern as insulin, after a meal. Like insulin, amylin is deficient in individuals with diabetes.Pramlintide is a synthetic analog of amylin, a glucoregulatory hormone that is synthesized by pancreatic β-cells and released into the bloodstream, in a similar pattern as insulin, after a meal. Like insulin, amylin is deficient in individuals with diabetes. Pramlintide is a 37-amino acid polypeptide that differs structurally from human amylin by the replacement of alanine, serine, and serine at positions 25, 28, and 29 respectively with proline.Pramlintide is an amlyinomimetic, a functional analog of the naturally occurring pancreatic hormone amylin. There appears to be at least three distinct receptor complexes that bind with high affinity to amylin."
862,"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoma are relatively rare T-cells malignancy, with only 20 to 25% of patients diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 1.7% of patients diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma having this T-cells variation of the disease. Due to the rarity of these T-cell malignancies, nelarabine was first granted orphan drug status and a fast-track designation by the FDA to address the unmet therapeutic needs of these cancers. Nelarabine is a purine nucleoside analog converted to its corresponding arabinosylguanine nucleotide triphosphate (araGTP), resulting in the inhibition of DNA synthesis and cytotoxicity. Nelarabine preferentially accumulates in T-cells since T-cells have a higher expression of enzymes that convert nelarabine to the active purine analog form, making them effective against T-cells malignancies. Ara-GMP is then monophosphorylated by deoxyguanosine kinase and deoxycytidine kinase to ara-G diphosphate, and then subsequently to the active ara-G triphosphate (ara-GTP)."
863,"In patients two years of age and older, abatacept is also indicated for the treatment of moderately-to-severely active juvenile idiopathic arthritis.Abatacept is a soluble fusion protein, which links the extracellular domain of human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) to the modified Fc (hinge, CH2, and CH3 domains) portion of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1). It is produced through recombinant DNA technology in mammalian CHO cells. Ordinarily, full T-cell activation requires binding of the T-cell receptor to an antigen-MHC complex on the antigen-presenting cell as well as a co-stimulatory signal provided by the binding of the CD28 protein on the surface of the T-cell with the CD80/86 proteins on the surface of the antigen-presenting cell. Abatacept was developed by Bristol-Myers-Squibb and is licensed in the US for the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis in the case of inadequate response to anti-TNF-alpha therapy.Abatacept is a selective costimulation modulator - like CTLA-4, the drug has shown to inhibit T-cell (T lymphocyte) activation by binding to CD80 and CD86, thereby blocking interaction with CD28. This results in the inhibition of autoimmune T-Cell activation that has been implcated in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis."
864,"For the acute and chronic treatment of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee in adults.Lumiracoxib is a COX-2 selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). On August 11, 2007, Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA, the Australian equivalent of the FDA) cancelled the registration of lumiracoxib in Australia due to concerns that it may cause liver failure. New Zealand and Canada have also followed suit in recalling the drug.Lumiracoxib has a different structure from the standard COX-2 inhibitors (e.g. celecoxib). It more closely resembles the structure of diclofenac (one chlorine substituted by fluorine, the phenylacetic acid has another methyl group in meta position), making it a member of the arylalkanoic acid family of NSAIDs. It binds to a different site on the COX-2 receptor than the standard COX-2 inhibitors."
865,"For use as a diagnostic agent in the screening of patients presumed to have adrenocortical insufficiency.Tetracosactide (also known as Cosyntropin) is a synthetic peptide that is identical to the 24-amino acid segment (sequence: SYSMEHFRWGKPVGKKRRPVKVYP) at the N-terminal of adrenocorticotropic hormone. ACTH (1-24), a segment similar in all species, contains the biological activity that stimulates production of corticosteroids in the adrenal cortex. Tetracosactide exhibits the same activity as natural ACTH with regard to all its biological activities. Various studies have shown that the biologic activity of ACTH resides in the N- terminal portion of the molecule and that the 1-20 amino acid residue is the minimal sequence retaining full activity. These are considered to be without physiological or clinical significance.Cosyntropin combines with a specific receptor in the adrenal cell plasma membrane and, in patients with normal adrenocortical function, stimulates the initial reaction involved in the synthesis of adrenal steroids (including cortisol, cortisone, weak androgenic substances, and a limited quantity of aldosterone) from cholesterol by increasing the quantity of the substrate within the mitochondria."
866,"For use as a diagnostic agent in the screening of patients presumed to have adrenocortical insufficiency. Purified corticotropin for injection is indicated for a variety of allergic and autoimmune conditions.Corticotropin (ACTH or adrenocorticotropic hormone) is a polypeptide hormone produced and secreted by the pituitary gland. It is an important player in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.Corticotropin acts through the stimulation of cell surface ACTH receptors, which are primarily located on the adrenocortical cells. Corticotropin stimulates the cortex of the adrenal gland and boosts the synthesis of corticosteroids, mainly glucocorticoids but also sex steroids (androgens). Corticotropin is also related to the circadian rhythm in many organisms.As a diagnostic aid (adrenocortical function), corticotropin combines with a specific receptor on the adrenal cell plasma membrane."
867,"Fenoterol is used for the treatment of asthma.Fenoterol is an adrenergic beta-2 agonist that is used as a bronchodilator and tocolytic.Fenoterol is a beta agonist designed to open up the airways to the lungs by decreasing bronchconstriction.Beta(2)-receptor stimulation in the lung causes relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle, bronchodilation, and increased bronchial airflow."
868,"Bismuth subsalicylate is a component of HELIDAC Therapy (bismuth subsalicylate, , and ), which is a treatment regimen indicated for the eradication of _H. Bismuth subsalicylate was first approved by the FDA in 1939 and is now mainly used to relieve nausea, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal discomfort. Bismuth subsalicylate is a component of HELIDAC Therapy (bismuth subsalicylate, , and ), which is a treatment regimen indicated for the eradication of _H. Organobismuth compounds, formed by the breakdown of bismuth subsalicylate in the gastrointestinal tract, inhibit the growth of _Helicobacter pylori_ and other bacteria implicated in gastrointestinal disorders, and some fungi. Salicylic acid from dissociated bismuth subsalicylate adds to the anti-inflammatory actions of bismuth salts by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase enzyme and limiting the formation of prostaglandin, a pro-inflammatory mediator."
869,"Used in the emergency treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.A beta-adrenergic antagonist that has been used in the emergency treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.Practolol is a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist that has been used in the emergency treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. Beta blockers inhibit normal epinephrine-mediated sympathetic  actions, but have minimal effect on resting subjects. That is, they reduce the effect of excitement/physical exertion on heart rate and force of contraction and dilation of blood vessels.Like other beta-adrenergic antagonists, practolol competes with adrenergic neurotransmitters such as catecholamines for binding at sympathetic receptor sites. Like propranolol and timolol, practolol binds at beta(1)-adrenergic receptors in the heart and vascular smooth muscle, inhibiting the effects of the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine and decreasing heart rate, cardiac output, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure."
870,"Sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine is indicated for the treatment of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in those patients in whom chloroquine resistance is suspected. A long acting sulfonamide that is used, usually in combination with other drugs, for respiratory, urinary tract, and malarial infections.Sulfadoxine helps inhibit the enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase which is an enzyme necessary in the conversion of PABA to folic acid. With this vital nutrient lacking, the parasite has difficulty in reproducing.Sulfadoxine is a sulfa drug, often used in combination with pyrimethamine  to treat malaria. Sulfa drugs or Sulfonamides are antimetabolites. Folic acid (as a vitamin) diffuses or is transported into human cells."

Rolitetracycline passively diffuses through porin channels in the bacterial membrane and reversibly binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit, preventing binding of tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex, and thus interfering with protein synthesis."
872,"Used to treat the symptoms of asthma, bronchitis, COPD, and emphysema.Oxtriphylline is the choline salt form of . Once in the body, theophylline is released and acts as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, adenosine receptor blocker, and histone deacetylase activator. Its main physiological reponse is to dilate the bronchioles. As such, oxytriphylline is indicated mainly for asthma, bronchospasm, and COPD (i.e. all the same indications as the other theophyllines). It is marketed under the name Choledyl SA, and several forms of oxytriphylline have been discontinued."
873,"Insulin is released from the pancreas following a meal to promote the uptake of glucose from the blood into internal organs and tissues such as the liver, fat cells, and skeletal muscle. Insulin is an important treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce or synthesize the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels. Insulin aspart is produced in a genetically modified strain of _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ (baker's yeast)    Without an adequate supply of insulin to promote absorption of glucose from the bloodstream, blood sugar levels can climb to dangerously high levels and can result in symptoms such as fatigue, headache, blurred vision, and increased thirst. Insulin aspart is a rapid-acting insulin analogue used to mimic postprandial insulin spikes in diabetic individuals. Substitution of the proline residue at B28 with aspartic acid reduces the tendency to form hexamers and results in a faster rate of absorption and onset of action and shorter duration of action."
874,"Insulin is typically prescribed for the management of diabetes mellitus to mimic the activity of endogenously produced human insulin, a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas that promotes glucose metabolism. Insulin is released from the pancreas following a meal to promote the uptake of glucose from the blood into internal organs and tissues such as the liver, fat cells, and skeletal muscle. Insulin is an important treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce or synthesize the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels. The onset of action of insulin detemir is 1 to 2 hours and its duration of action is up to 24 hours. Interestingly, it has a lower affinity (30%) for the insulin receptor than human insulin.Insulin detemir binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units."
875,"Insulin is typically prescribed for the management of diabetes mellitus to mimic the activity of endogenously produced human insulin, a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas that promotes glucose metabolism. Insulin is an important treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce or synthesize the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels. Without an adequate supply of insulin to promote absorption of glucose from the bloodstream, blood sugar levels can climb to dangerously high levels and can result in symptoms such as fatigue, headache, blurred vision, and increased thirst. Insulin glulisine is a rapid-acting insulin analogue used to mimic postprandial insulin spikes in diabetic individuals. Substitution of the arginine at position B3 for lysine and replacement of the B29 lysine with glutamic acid decreases the propensity to form hexamers, stabilizes the hormone in monomeric form and results in a rapid rate of absorption and short duration of action."
876,"The use of fosamprenavir is pending revision due to a potential association between the drug and myocardial infarction and dyslipidemia in HIV infected adults.Fosamprenavir is a prodrug of amprenavir, an inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease.Fosamprenavir is hydrolyzed by cellular phosphatases to the antiretroviral protease inhibitor amprenavir. This hydrolysis allows for the slow release of amprenavir, reducing the number of pills a patient must take.Fosamprenavir is a prodrug that is rapidly hydrolyzed to amprenavir by cellular phosphatases in the gut epithelium as it is absorbed. Amprenavir is an inhibitor of HIV-1 protease. During HIV replication, HIV protease cleaves viral polypeptide products of the Gag and Gag-Pol genes to form structural proteins of the virion core and essential viral enzymes. Amprenavir interferes with this process by binding to the active site of HIV-1 protease, thereby preventing the processing of viral Gag and Gag-Pol polyprotein precursors, resulting in the formation of immature non-infectious viral particles."
877,"It can also be substituted, short-term, for oral phenytoin in patients aged two years and older when oral phenytoin administration is not possible.Fosphenytoin is a water-soluble phenytoin prodrug used only in hospitals for the treatment of epileptic seizures. It works by slowing down impulses in the brain that cause seizures. Its main mechanism is to block frequency-dependent, use-dependent and voltage-dependent neuronal sodium channels, and therefore limit repetitive firing of action potentials.Fosphenytoin is a water-soluble phenytoin prodrug used for the treatment of epileptic seizures. Withdrawal of fosphenytoin sodium may precipitate seizures and should be done gradually.Fosphenytoin is a prodrug of phenytoin and accordingly, its anticonvulsant effects are attributable to phenytoin. Phenytoin acts on sodium channels on the neuronal cell membrane, limiting the spread of seizure activity and reducing seizure propagation."
878,"For the treatment of bacterial infections.A macrolide antibiotic from Streptomyces narbonensis. The drug has antimicrobial activity against a wide spectrum of pathogens.Josamycin is a macrolide antibiotic from Streptomyces narbonensis. The mechanism of action of macrolides such as Josamycin is via inhibition of bacterial protein biosynthesis by binding reversibly to the subunit 50S of the bacterial ribosome, thereby inhibiting translocation of peptidyl tRNA. This action is mainly bacteriostatic, but can also be bactericidal in high concentrations. Macrolides tend to accumulate within leukocytes, and are therefore actually transported into the site of infection."
879,"(From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p826)As a thiazide diuretic, Polythiazide inhibits the sodium-chloride symporter  which decreases solute reabsorption leading to a retention of water in the urine, as water normally follows solutes. More frequent urination is due to the increased loss of water that has not been retained from the body as a result of a concomitant relationship with sodium loss from the convoluted tubule. The short-term anti-hypertensive action is based on the fact that thiazides decrease preload, decreasing blood pressureAs a diuretic, polythiazide inhibits active chloride reabsorption at the early distal tubule via the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter (TSC), resulting in an increase in the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water. Thiazides like polythiazide also inhibit sodium ion transport across the renal tubular epithelium through binding to the thiazide sensitive sodium-chloride transporter. The antihypertensive mechanism of polythiazide may be mediated through its action on carbonic anhydrases in the smooth muscle or through its action on the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (KCa) channel, also found in the smooth muscle."
880,"Used to treat hypertension.Quinethazone, marketed as Hydromox, is a thiazide diuretic indicated for hypertension. Thiazides also cause loss of potassium and an increase in serum uric acid. Thiazides have been shown to prevent hypertension-related morbidity and mortality although the mechanism is not fully understood. Thiazides cause vasodilation by activating calcium-activated potassium channels (large conductance) in vascular smooth muscles and inhibiting various carbonic anhydrases in vascular tissue.As a diuretic, quinethazone inhibits active chloride reabsorption at the early distal tubule via the Na-Cl cotransporter, resulting in an increase in the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water. Thiazides like quinethazone also inhibit sodium ion transport across the renal tubular epithelium through binding to the thiazide sensitive sodium-chloride transporter."

It is a parenterally administered broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic. It is generally formulated as a formate ester, . It is no longer marketed in the United States.The parenteral prodrug formate ester cefamandole nafate is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic. Cephalosporins have in vitro activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms.Like all beta-lactam antibiotics, cefamandole binds to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, causing the inhibition of the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis."
882,"Mainly used to treat bacterial infections of the skin. It can also be used to treat moderately severe bacterial infections involving the lung, bone, joint, stomach, blood, heart valve, and urinary tract. It is clinically effective against infections caused by staphylococci and streptococci species of Gram positive bacteria. Cefazolin has broad-spectrum antibiotic action due to inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. It attains high serum levels and is excreted quickly via the urine.In vitro tests demonstrate that the bactericidal action of cephalosporins results from inhibition of cell wall synthesis."
883,"For the treatment of bacterial infections caused by susceptible microorganisms.A second-generation cephalosporin administered intravenously or intramuscularly. Its bactericidal action results from inhibition of cell wall synthesis. It is used for urinary tract infections, lower respiratory tract infections, and soft tissue and bone infections.Cefonicid is a second-generation cephalosporin administered intravenously or intramuscularly. Its bactericidal action results from inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins."

The drug is highly resistant to a broad spectrum of beta-lactamases and is active against a wide range of both aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms.Cefotetan is a semisynthetic cephamycin antibiotic that is administered intravenously or intramuscularly. The drug is highly resistant to a broad spectrum of beta-lactamases and is active against a wide range of both aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. The bactericidal action of cefotetan results from inhibition of cell wall synthesis by binding and inhibiting the bacterial penicillin binding proteins which help in the cell wall biosynthesis.
885,"For the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible strains microorganisms.Cefoxitin is a semi-synthetic, broad-spectrum cepha antibiotic for intravenous administration. It is derived from cephamycin C, which is produced by Streptomyces lactamdurans.Cefoxitin is a cephamycin antibiotic often grouped with the second-generation cephalosporins. It is active against a broad range of gram-negative bacteria including anaerobes. The methoxy group in the 7a position provides cefoxitin with a high degree of stability in the presence of beta-lactamases, both penicillinases and cephalosporinases, of gram-negative bacteria.The bactericidal action of cefoxitin results from inhibition of cell wall synthesis."
886,"A semi-synthetic cephalosporin antibiotic.Cefradine is a first generation cephalosporin antibiotic with a spectrum of activity similar to Cefalexin. Cefradine is a beta-lactam antibiotic. By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, it inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that Cefradine interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."
887,"It belongs to the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) class of drugs. (The absolute bioavailability of cilazaprilat after oral administration of cilazaprilat is 19%.) Ingestion of food immediately before the administration of cilazapril reduces the average peak plasma concentration of cilazaprilat by 29%, delays the peak by one hour and reduces the bioavailability of cilazaprilat by 14%. It competes with angiotensin I for binding at the angiotensin-converting enzyme, blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. As angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor and a negative feedback mediator for renin activity, lower angiotensin II levels results in a decrease in blood pressure, an increase in renin activity, and stimulation of baroreceptor reflex mechanisms."
888,"For the treatment of hypertension.Forasartan, a specific angiotensin II antagonist, is used to treat hypertension. Forasartan competes with angiotensin II for binding at the AT1 receptor subtype. As angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor which also stimulates the synthesis and release of aldosterone, blockage of its effects results in a decreases in systemic vascular resistance.By inhibiting angiotensin II receptors, this drug leads to a decrease in sodium reabsorption (which decreases water content of blood) and a decrease in vasoconstriction. Combined, this has the effect of lowering blood pressure.Forasartan competes with angiotensin II for binding at the AT1 receptor subtype. As angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor which also stimulates the synthesis and release of aldosterone, blockage of its effects results in a decreases in systemic vascular resistance."
889,"Spirapril is an ACE inhibitor class drug used to treat hypertension.Spirapril is an ACE inhibitor antihypertensive drug used to treat hypertension. ACE inhibitors are used primarily in treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure.Spirapril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. By blocking ACE, spirapril decreases angiotensin II which is a vasoconstrictor and inducer of aldosterone. Combined, this leades to a decrease in blood pressure.Spiraprilat, the active metabolite of spirapril, competes with angiotensin I for binding at the angiotensin-converting enzyme, blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. As angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor and a negative-feedback mediator for renin activity, lower concentrations result in a decrease in blood pressure and stimulation of baroreceptor reflex mechanisms, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion."
890,"A barbiturate with hypnotic and sedative properties (but not antianxiety). (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p565)Amobarbital (like all barbiturates) works by binding to the GABAA receptor at either the alpha or the beta sub unit. Like benzodiazepines, barbiturates potentiate the effect of GABA at this receptor. Glutamate is the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian CNS. Amobarbital also appears to bind neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors."
891,"It was determined that the substance was capable of demonstrating sedative, hypnotic, and anticonvulsant effects. A primary treatment indicated for the use of aprobarbital was subsequently insomnia. Aprobarbital was never as widely used as more common barbiturate derivatives such as phenobarbital and is now rarely prescribed.Aprobarbital (like all barbiturates) works by binding to the GABAA receptor at either the alpha or the beta sub unit. Like benzodiazepines, barbiturates potentiate the effect of GABA at this receptor. In addition to this GABA-ergic effect, barbiturates also block the AMPA receptor, a subtype of glutamate receptor."
892,"It is thought to act on receptors in the brain (GABA receptors) causing the release of the chemical GABA. Butethal binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl  ionopore at the GABAA receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl  ionopore is open. All of these effects are associated with marked decreases in GABA-sensitive neuronal calcium conductance (gCa). The net result of barbiturate action is acute potentiation of inhibitory GABAergic tone. Barbiturates also act through potent (if less well characterized) and direct inhibition of excitatory AMPA-type glutamate receptors, resulting in a profound suppression of glutamatergic neurotransmission."
893,"For the induction of anesthesia prior to the use of other general anesthetic agents and for induction of anesthesia for short surgical, diagnostic, or therapeutic procedures associated with minimal painful stimuli.A barbiturate that is effective as a hypnotic and sedative.Hexobarbital is a barbiturate derivative having hypnotic and sedative effects. It was subsequently used in the 1940s and 1950s as an anesthetic for surgery. Furthermore, the agent also demonstrates a fairly quick onset of action that also possesses a short duration of action. However it can be difficult to control the depth of anesthesia with hexobarbital which makes it quite dangerous, and it has now been replaced by safer drugs in human medicine, usually thiopental would be the barbiturate of choice for this application these days.Hexobarbital binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl- ionopore at the GABA-A receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl- ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged."
894,"It is used as the estrogen component of many combination ORAL contraceptives.Mestranol is the 3-methyl ether of ethinylestradiol. It binds to (and activates) the estrogen receptor. Mestranol is a biologically inactive prodrug of ethinylestradiol to which it is demethylated in the liver with a conversion efficiency of 70%. Estrogens diffuse into their target cells and interact with a protein receptor. Estrogens increase the hepatic synthesis of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), thyroid-binding globulin (TBG), and other serum proteins and suppress follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary."
895,"Penbutolol is contraindicated in patients with cardiogenic shock, sinus bradycardia, second and third degree atrioventricular conduction block, bronchial asthma, and those with known hypersensitivity.Penbutolol is a drug in the beta-blocker class used to treat hypertension. Penbutolol binds both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors, rendering it a non-selective beta-blocker. Penbutolol is contraindicated in patients with cardiogenic shock, sinus bradycardia, second and third degree atrioventricular conduction block, bronchial asthma, and those with known hypersensitivity.Penbutolol is a ß-1, ß-2 (nonselective) adrenergic receptor antagonist. In human studies, however, heart rate decreases have been similar to those seen with propranolol.Penbutolol acts on the β1 adrenergic receptors in both the heart and the kidney. The increase in cAMP leads to activation of protein kinase A (PKA), which alters the movement of calcium ions in heart muscle and increases the heart rate."
896,"Iohexol ia used in myelography, arthrography, nephroangiography, arteriography, and other radiographic procedures.Iohexol is an effective non-ionic, water-soluble contrast agent which is used in myelography, arthrography, nephroangiography, arteriography, and other radiographic procedures. Its low systemic toxicity is the combined result of low chemotoxicity and low osmolality.Iohexol is an effective non-ionic, water-soluble contrast agent which is used in myelography, arthrography, nephroangiography, arteriography, and other radiographic procedures. The degree of opacity produced by these compounds is directly proportional to the total amount (concentration and volume) of the iodinated contrast agent in the path of the x-rays. After intrathecal administration into the subarachnoid space, diffusion of iohexol in the CSF allows the visualization of the subarachnoid spaces of the head and spinal canal. After intravascular administration, iohexol makes opaque those vessels in its path of flow, allowing visualization of the internal structures until significant hemodilution occurs."
897,"It is an alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor agonist; however, it also causes the indirect release of norepinephrine from sympathetic neurons, inhibiting norepinephrine reuptake and displacing more norepinephrine from storage vesicles. Also, the use of ephedrine for hypotension prophylaxis is associated with a higher risk of hypertension, compared to when ephedrine is used to treat hypotension.Ephedrine is a direct and indirect sympathomimetic amine. As a direct effect, ephedrine activates alpha-adrenergic and beta-adrenergic receptors. Ephedrine acts as an agonist of alpha-1, beta-1 and beta-2-adrenergic receptors. The stimulation of alpha-1-adrenergic receptors causes the constriction of veins and a rise in blood pressure, the stimulation of beta-1-adrenergic receptors increases cardiac chronotropy and inotropy, and the stimulation of beta-2-adrenergic receptors causes vasodilation and bronchodilation."
898,"Used to maintain blood pressure in hypotensive states.A sympathomimetic agent with mainly indirect effects on adrenergic receptors. Although the central stimulant effects of mephentermine are much less than those of amphetamine, its use may lead to amphetamine-type dependence. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p1248)Mephentermine is a sympathomimetic agent with mainly indirect effects on adrenergic receptors. Although the central stimulant effects of mephentermine are much less than those of amphetamine, its use may lead to amphetamine-type dependence. Cardiac output and systolic and diastolic pressures are usually increased."
899,"MAO-A is found predominantly in the GI tract and liver, and regulates the metabolic degradation of circulating catecholamines and dietary amines. MAO-B is the major form in the human brain and is responsible for the regulation of the metabolic degradation of dopamine and phenylethylamine. In ex vivo animal studies in brain, liver and intestinal tissues rasagiline was shown to be a potent,selective, and irreversible monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) inhibitor. One mechanism is believed to be related to its MAO-B inhibitory activity, which causes an increase in extracellular levels of dopamine in the striatum. The elevated dopamine level and subsequent increased dopaminergic activity are likely to mediate rasagiline's beneficial effects seen in models of dopaminergic motor dysfunction."
900,"For the treatment of bacterial infections (usually in combination with dalfopristin).Quinupristin/dalfopristin is a combination of two antibiotics used to treat infections by staphylococci and by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. Dalfopristin inhibits the early phase of protein synthesis in the bacterial ribosome and quinupristin inhibits the late phase of protein synthesis. The combination of the two components acts synergistically and is more effective in vitro than each component alone.Quinupristin is a streptogramin antibiotic, derived from pristinamycin I. By inhibiting the bacterial ribosomal subunits, protein synthesis is inhibited thus leading to eventual bacterial cell death or stasis.Quinupristin inhibits the late phase of protein synthesis in the bacterial ribosome. Dalfopristin binds to the 23S portion of the 50S ribosomal subunit, and changes the conformation it, enhancing the binding of quinupristin by a factor of about 100."
901,"Indicated for over-the-counter use as a supplement for cardiovascular and neuromuscular health, and as an antacid for relief of acid indigestion and upset stomach. Magnesium oxide, in combination with sodium picosulfate and anhydrous citric acid, is indicated for cleansing of the colon as a preparation for colonoscopy in adults and pediatric patients ages 9 years and older.Magnesium oxide is an inorganic compound that occurs in nature as the mineral periclase. In aqueous media combines quickly with water to form magnesium hydroxide. It is used as an antacid and mild laxative and has many nonmedicinal uses.The term ""Milk of Magnesia"" was first used to describe a white aqueous, mildly alkaline suspension of magnesium hydroxide formulated at about 8%w/v. Milk of magnesia is primarily used to alleviate constipation, but can also be used to relieve indigestion and heartburn."
902,"Cortisone acetate is indicated to treat a wide variety of endocrine, rheumatic, collagen, dermatologic, allergic, ophthalmic, respiratory, hematologic, neoplastic, edematous, and gastrointestinal diseases and disorders.Cortisone acetate was first isolate in 1935 and became more widely researched in 1949. Since then, glucocorticoids such as cortisone acetate have been used to treat a number of inflammatory conditions such as endocrine, rheumatic, collagen, dermatologic, allergic, ophthalmic, respiratory, hematologic, neoplastic, edematous, and gastrointestinal diseases and disorders. Cortisone acetate was granted FDA approval on 13 June 1950.Corticosteroids bind to the glucocorticoid receptor, inhibiting pro-inflammatory signals, and promoting anti-inflammatory signals. The duration of action is moderate as it is generally given once daily. Lower doses of corticosteroids provide an anti-inflammatory effect, while higher doses are immunosuppressive."
903,"For the treatment of all conditions in which corticosteroid therapy is indicated except adrenal-deficiency states for which its lack of sodium-retaining properties.A glucocorticoid with the general properties of corticosteroids. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p737)Paramethasone is a glucocorticoid with the general properties of corticosteroids. Glucocorticoids also suppress humoral immunity, causing B cells to express lower amounts of IL-2 and IL-2 receptors. The diminished amounts of IL-2 also leads to fewer T lymphocyte cells being activated.Glucocorticoids such as paramethasone can inhibit leukocyte infiltration at the site of inflammation, interfere with mediators of inflammatory response, and suppress humoral immune responses. Prednisolone is a glucocorticoid receptor agonist."
904,"Sodium bicarbonate is used for the treatment of metabolic acidosis which may occur in severe renal disease, uncontrolled diabetes, circulatory insufficiency due to shock or severe dehydration, extracorporeal circulation of blood, cardiac arrest and severe primary lactic acidosis. Further indicated in the treatment of certain drug intoxications, including barbiturates (where dissociation of the barbiturateprotein complex is desired), in poisoning by salicylates or methyl alcohol and in hemolytic reactions requiring alkalinization of the urine to diminish nephrotoxicity of blood pigments.Sodium bicarbonate is a white, crystalline powder that is commonly used as a pH buffering agent, an electrolyte replenisher, systemic alkalizer and in topical cleansing solutions.Intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy increases plasma bicarbonate, buffers excess hydrogen ion concentration, raises blood pH and reverses the clinical manifestations of acidosis.Sodium bicarbonate is a systemic alkalizer, which increases plasma bicarbonate, buffers excess hydrogen ion concentration, and raises blood pH, thereby reversing the clinical manifestations of acidosis. By maintaining an alkaline urine, the actual dissolution of uric acid stones may be accomplished. Sodium bicarbonate acts as an antacid and reacts chemically to neutralize or buffer existing quantities of stomach acid but has no direct effect on its output. This action results in increased pH value of stomach contents, thus providing relief of hyperacidity symptoms."
905,"Also for the treatment of secondary hyperlipidaemias, e.g. severe hypertriglyceridemias, when sufficient improvement does not occur after correction of the underlying disorder (e.g. diabetes mellitus).Antilipemic agent that lowers cholesterol and triglycerides. It decreases low density lipoproteins and increases high density lipoproteins.Bezafibrate is an antilipemic agent that lowers cholesterol and triglycerides. Bezafibrate lowers elevated blood lipids (triglycerides and cholesterol). This may lead, amongst other things, to a reduction in both blood and plasma viscosity. A reduction in blood glucose concentration due to an increase in glucose tolerance has been reported in diabetic patients."
906,"Colchicine is indicated for the prophylaxis and treatment of gout flares. Some off-label uses of colchicine include the treatment of the manifestations of Behcet's syndrome, pericarditis, and postpericardiotomy syndrome.Colchicine is an alkaloid drug derived from a plant belonging to the Lily family, known as _Colchicum autumnale_, or ""autumn crocus."" Colchicine is used in the treatment of gout flares and Familial Mediterranean fever, and prevention of major cardiovascular events. It has also been investigated in other inflammatory and fibrotic conditions.Colchicine ameliorates the symptoms of gout and Familial Mediterranean fever. Colchicine has a narrow therapeutic window.The exact mechanism of action of colchicine has not been fully established; however, colchicine likely interferes with the intracellular assembly of the inflammasome complex present in neutrophils and monocytes that mediates activation of interleukin-1β, an inflammatory mediator."
907,"L7973,L33174] In addition to its use for contraceptive effects, this combination is used to treat moderate acne vulgaris and the symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Drospirenone combined with estrogen may also may aid in the prevention of osteoporosis in women who have been post-menopausal for at least a year and are not candidates for other therapies. When used for the treatment of acne vulgaris, drospirenone-containing contraceptives should only be used in women ≥14 years of age who have experienced menarche, desire oral contraception, and do not have any contraindications to oral contraceptives. In 2012, however, a safety statement by the FDA concluded that the increase in the risk of thromboembolism resulting from the use of drospirenone remains unclear, as studies regarding this risk are conflicting. **A note on venous thromboembolism risk and antimineralcorticoid effects**    As with other oral contraceptives, the risk of venous thromboembolism and cardiovascular events may be increased when drospirenone is taken."
908,"For the treatment and management of congestive cardiac insufficiency, arrhythmias and heart failure.A cardiac glycoside sometimes used in place of digoxin. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p665)Digitoxin is a cardiac glycoside sometimes used in place of DIGOXIN. It has a longer half-life than digoxin; toxic effects, which are similar to those of digoxin, are longer lasting (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p665). Digitoxin lacks the strength of evidence that digoxin has in the management of heart failure.Digitoxin inhibits the Na-K-ATPase membrane pump, resulting in an increase in intracellular sodium and calcium concentrations. Digitoxin also acts on the electrical activity of the heart, increasing the slope of phase 4 depolarization, shortening the action potential duration, and decreasing the maximal diastolic potential."
909,"The parent compound has an elimination half-life of about 1 hour. Salicylic acid (the active metabolite) biotransformation is saturated at anti-inflammatory doses of salsalate. Such capacity limited biotransformation results in an increase in the half-life of salicylic acid from 3.5 to 16 or more hours.Salsalate is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent for oral administration. In contrast to aspirin, salsalate causes no greater fecal gastrointestinal blood loss than placebo.The mode of anti-inflammatory action of salsalate and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is not fully defined, but appears to be primarily associated with inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. Although salicylic acid (the primary metabolite of salsalate) is a weak inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro, salsalate appears to selectively inhibit prostaglandin synthesis in vivo, providing anti-inflammatory activity equivalent to aspirin and indomethacin."
910,"Neostigmine is used for the symptomatic treatment of myasthenia gravis by improving muscle tone.A cholinesterase inhibitor used in the treatment of myasthenia gravis and to reverse the effects of muscle relaxants such as gallamine and tubocurarine. Neostigmine, unlike physostigmine, does not cross the blood-brain barrier.Neostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor used in the treatment of myasthenia gravis and to reverse the effects of muscle relaxants such as gallamine and tubocurarine. Neostigmine, unlike physostigmine, does not cross the blood-brain barrier. By inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, more acetylcholine is available in the synapse, therefore, more of it can bind to the fewer receptors present in myasthenia gravis and can better trigger muscular contraction. So, with acetylcholinesterase inhibited, more acetylcholine is present By interfering with the breakdown of acetylcholine, neostigmine indirectly stimulates both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors which are involved in muscle contraction.."
911,"It has the histamine-antagonist properties of the antihistamines together with central nervous system effects resembling those of chlorpromazine. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p604)Methotrimeprazine is a phenothiazine with pharmacological activity similar to that of both chlorpromazine and promethazine. It has the histamine-antagonist properties of the antihistamines together with central nervous system effects resembling those of chlorpromazine. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p604)Methotrimeprazine's antipsychotic effect is largely due to its antagonism of dopamine receptors in the brain. In addition, its binding to 5HT2 receptors may also play a role."
912,"For the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections, genital and urinary infections like prostatitis, and skin infections.Temafloxacin is an antibiotic agent belonging to the fluoroquinolone drug class. It was first approved for use in the U.S. market in 1992, but was withdrawn shortly due to the reports of serious adverse reactions, such as allergic reactions and hemolyric anemia, resulting in three deaths.Temafloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic drug, marketed as Omniflox by Abbot Laboratories, which was withdrawn from the market in 1992 due to fatal adverse effects. Flouroquinolones such as lomefloxacin possess excellent activity against gram-negative aerobic bacteria such as E.coli and Neisseria gonorrhoea as well as gram-positive bacteria including S. pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. They also posses effective activity against shigella, salmonella, campylobacter, gonococcal organisms, and multi drug resistant pseudomonas and enterobacter.The bactericidal action of temafloxacin results from interference with the activity of the bacterial enzymes DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, which are needed for the transcription and replication of bacterial DNA. DNA gyrase appears to be the primary quinolone target for gram-negative bacteria."
913,"For the treatment of endometriosis and fibrocystic breast disease (in patients unresponsive to simple measures). Also used for the prophylactic treatment of all types of hereditary angioedema in males and females.A synthetic steroid with antigonadotropic and anti-estrogenic activities that acts as an anterior pituitary suppressant by inhibiting the pituitary output of gonadotropins. Danazol has been used in the treatment of endometriosis and some benign breast disorders.Danazol is a derivative of the synthetic steroid ethisterone, a modified testosterone. It possesses some androgenic properties.As a gonadotropin inhibitor, danazol suppresses the pituitary-ovarian axis possibly by inhibiting the output of pituitary gonadotropins. In fibrocystic breast disease, the exact mechanism of action of danazol is unknown, but may be related to suppressed estrogenic stimulation as a result of decreased ovarian production of estrogen."
914,"For the prevention and reversal of bronchospasm in patients 12 years of age and older with asthma and reversible bronchospasm associated with bronchitis and emphysema.Bambuterol is a long acting beta-adrenoceptor agonist used in the treatment of asthma. It is a prodrug of terbutaline.Bambuterol is a long acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonist used in the treatment of asthma. It is a prodrug of terbutaline. Bambuterol causes smooth muscle relaxation, resulting in dilation of bronchial passages.The pharmacologic effects of bambuterol are at least in part attributable to stimulation through beta-adrenergic receptors (beta 2 receptors) of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic AMP. Increased cyclic AMP levels are associated with relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells."
915,"For the treatment of nasal symptoms associated with seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older.Ciclesonide is a glucocorticoid used to treat obstructive airway diseases. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of effects on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in allergic inflammation.Glucocorticoids such as ciclesonide can inhibit leukocyte infiltration at the site of inflammation, interfere with mediators of inflammatory response, and suppress humoral immune responses. Ciclesonide reduces inflammatory reaction by limiting the capillary dilatation and permeability of the vascular structures. These compounds restrict the accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages and reduce the release of vasoactive kinins. Ciclesonide is a glucocorticoid receptor agonist."
916,"Cefepime is also used in combination with  to treat cUTI.Cefepime is a fourth-generation cephalosporin antibiotic developed in 1994. Cefepime is active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and has greater activity against both compared to third-generation antibiotics. Cefepime is normally used to treat severe nosocomial pneumonia and infections caused by multi-resistant microorganisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and is also indicated for the empirical treatment of febrile neutropenia. The popularity of its third-generation predecessors, its clinical efficacy, and the high prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria might be some of the factors leading to an increase in the use of cefepime. In animal models of infection, the time that the unbound plasma concentration of cefepime exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of infecting organisms has been shown to correlate with treatment efficacy."
917,"Cefacetrile is a broad-spectrum first generation cephalosporin antibiotic effective in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial infections.A derivative of 7-aminocephalosporanic acid.Cefacetrile is effective against many Gram-positive bacterial strains and somewhat less effective against Gram-negative species. It works by inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. It attains high serum levels and is excreted quickly via the urine.In vitro tests demonstrate that the bactericidal action of cephalosporins results from inhibition of cell wall synthesis. By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, it inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins."
918,"Indicated for the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (ABECB), acute bacterial otitis media, pharyngitis, and tonsilitis.Ceftibuten is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic that is orally-administered. It is typically used to treat acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (ABECB), acute bacterial otitis media, pharyngitis, and tonsilitis.Ceftibuten is an antibiotic with bactericidal actions. Ceftibuten exerts its bactericidal action by binding to essential target proteins of the bacterial cell wall. This binding leads to inhibition of cell-wall synthesis."
919,"Commonly used to treat acute otitis media, pharyngitis, and sinusitis, cefpodoxime proxetil is a prodrug which is absorbed and de-esterified by the intestinal mucosa to Cefpodoxime.Cefpodoxime is shown to be effective against most Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, except Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus, and Bacteroides fragilis.Cefpodoxime is active against a wide spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Cefpodoxime is stable in the presence of beta-lactamase enzymes. Cefpodoxime is inactivated by certain extended spectrum beta-lactamases. The bactericidal activity of cefpodoxime results from its inhibition of cell wall synthesis. The active metabolite of cefpodoxime binds preferentially to penicillin binding protein 3, which inhibits production of peptidoglycan, the primary constituent of bacterial cell walls."
920,"This prevents carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, II, VII, IX and X, and interferes with coagulation. This prevents carboxylation of certain glutamic acid residues near the N-terminals of clotting factors II, VII, IX and X, the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. Glutamic acid carboxylation is important for the interaction between these clotting factors and calcium. Both the extrinsic (via factors VII, X and II) and intrinsic (via factors IX, X and II) are affected by acenocoumarol.Acenocoumarol inhibits vitamin K reductase, resulting in depletion of the reduced form of vitamin K (vitamin KH2). As vitamin K is a cofactor for the carboxylation of glutamate residues on the N-terminal regions of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, this limits the gamma-carboxylation and subsequent activation of the vitamin K-dependent coagulant proteins."
921,"Testosterone propionate is used in veterinary practice in heifers in order to stimulate maximal growth.Testosterone propionate is a slower-releasing anabolic steroid with a short half-life. It is a synthetic androstane steroid derivative of testosterone in the form of 17β propionate ester of testosterone. Testosterone propionate was developed initially by Watson labs, and FDA approved on February 5, 1974. Currently, this drug has been discontinued in humans, but the vet application is still available as an OTC.The administration of testosterone propionate can induce production of proteins related to male sexual development. Clinical trials have shown a decrease in plasma LH after the administration of testosterone propionate.The effects of testosterone in humans and other vertebrates occur by way of two main mechanisms: by activation of the androgen receptor (directly or as DHT), and by conversion to estradiol and activation of certain estrogen receptors."
922,"Formerly widely used as an antipyretic and analgesic in rheumatism, neuritis, and common colds. Currently used to measure total body water.Aminophenazone is a pyrazolone with analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties that carries a risk of agranulocytosis. In biomedical applications, radiolabelled (13C-labeled) aminophenazone has been used in breath tests to measure the cytochrome P-450 metabolic activity in liver function tests. The FDA suspended the use of aminophenazone due to its association with agranulocytosis, a life-threatening side effect.Aminophenazone exhibits analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties.Aminophenazone is metabolized very slowly by normal newborn babies. In older infants, a higher amount of exhaled 13-CO2 is observed."
923,"For use as an antiarrhythmic agent.An alkaloid found in the root of Rauwolfia serpentina, among other plant sources. Ajmaline produces potent sodium channel blocking effects and a very short half-life which makes it a very useful drug for acute intravenous treatments. The drug has been very popular in some countries for the treatment of atrial fibrillation in patients with the Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome and in well tolerated monomorphic ventricular tachycardias. By interfering with the sodium channels, this drug allows for improvement in abnormal rhythms of the heartThe class I antiarrhythmic agents interfere with the sodium channel. A class IA agent lengthens the action potential (right shift) which brings about improvement in abnormal heart rhythms."
924,"Used in the treatment of congestive heart failure.Amrinone (or inamrinone) is a type 3 pyridine phosphodiesterase inhibitor. It is used in the treatment of congestive heart failure.Amrinone is a positive inotropic cardiotonic with vasodilator properties, phosphodiesterase inhibitory activity, and the ability to stimulate calcium ion influx into the cardiac cell.Amrinone is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (PDE3), resulting in increased cAMP and cGMP which leads to an increase in the calcium influx like that caused by beta-agonists resulting in increased inotropic effect."
925,Aprindine is a cardiac depressant used in arrhythmias.
926,"However, with the exception of proven progesterone deficiency, such use is no longer recommended. In threatened miscarriage in progesterone-deficient women a suggested dose is 5 mg three times daily by mouth for 5 to 7 days.Allylestrenol is similar in structure and function to progesterone. Progesterone shares the pharmacological actions of the progestins. In women who have adequate endogenous estrogen, progesterone transforms a proliferative endometrium into a secretory one. Progesterone is essential for the development of decidual tissue and is necessary to increase endometrial receptivity for implantation of an embryo."
927,"Antipyrine is an analgesic often used to test effects of other drugs on liver enzymes. Antipyrine is often used in testing the effects of other drugs or diseases on drug-metabolizing enzymes in the liver. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p29)Antipyrine is an analgesic and antipyretic that has been given by mouth and as ear drops. Antipyrine is often used in testing the effects of other drugs or diseases on drug-metabolizing enzymes in the liver. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p29)Antipyrine is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis."
928,"Alfacalcidol is indicated in adult patients with chronic renal failure for the management of hypocalcemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, or osteodystrophy. In approving European countries, alfacalcidol is also indicated for managing nutritional and malabsorptive rickets and osteomalacia, vitamin D-dependent rickets and osteomalacia, and hypophosphataemic vitamin D resistant rickets and osteomalacia.Alfacalcidol works to increase serum levels of calcium by stimulating intestinal calcium absorption, reabsorption of calcium from bone, and possibly the renal reabsorption of calcium. In patients with chronic renal failure, serum calcium levels were elevated while parathyroid hormone and alkaline phosphatase levels returned to normal levels within five days following alfacalcidol administration. Since alfacalcidol suppresses parathyroid hormone, a reduction in parathyroid hormone levels is achieved more rapidly in patients on intermittent intravenous therapy, with significant reductions occurring within three months of therapy. In patients with nutritional osteomalacia, alfacalcidol increased calcium absorption with six hours of oral administration and the effects peaked at 24 hours.In conditions like chronic renal failure, renal bone disease, hypoparathyroidism, and vitamin D dependent rickets, the kidneys' capacity for 1α-hydroxylation is impaired, leading to reduced production of endogenous 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and aberrated mineral metabolism."
929,"For the treatment of insomnia.Glutethimide is a hypnotic and sedative. Its use has been largely superseded by other drugs.Glutethimide, like the barbiturates, is a hypnotic sedative. It was introduced in 1954 as a safer alternative to barbiturates but was soon determined to be just as likely to cause addiction and withdrawal symptoms.Glutethimide seems to be a GABA agonist which helps induce sedation. It also induces CYP 2D6. When taken with codeine, it enables the body to convert higher amounts of codeine (higher than the average 5 - 10%) to morphine."
930,"However, under the name diamorphine, heroin is a legal prescription drug in the United Kingdom.The onset of heroin's effects is dependent on the method of administration. Once in the brain, heroin is rapidly metabolized into morphine by removal of the acetyl groups, therefore making it a prodrug for the delivery of morphine . Subsequently, whether eliciting actions peripherally (on smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, kidney, lung, liver, or spleen tissue , for example) or on the central nervous system, it is ultimately the morphine metabolite of heroin that then binds with opioid receptors and produces the narcotic opioid effects commonly associated with the substance .When administered orally, diamorphine experiences extensive first-pass metabolism by way of deacetylation to generate the active metabolites 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) and morphine . Despite diamorphine possessing little to no opioid agonist activity itself, its rapid transit across the blood-brain-barrier elicits a far faster onset of activity in comparison to the extensive first-pass metabolism of oral administration . Morphine, along with other opioids, are agonists to four endogenous neurotransmitters ."
931,Ethylmorphine is an analgesic used for pain relief.A narcotic analgesic and antitussive. In the US it is a schedule II drug (single-entity) and schedule III drug (in combination products).Ethylmorphine is metabolized by the enzyme cytochrome P450 2D6 to morphine. Morphine is a narcotic pain management agent indicated for the relief of pain in patients who require opioid analgesics for more than a few days. Morphine interacts predominantly with the opioid mu-receptor. Opioids also produce respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers.Ethylmorphine is metabolized by the liver enzyme cytochrome P450 2D6 to morphine.
932,"Bolasterone (INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name) (brand names Myagen, Methosarb; former developmental code name U-19763), also known as 7α,17α-dimethyltestosterone, is a 17α-alkylated androgen/anabolic steroid (AAS) which is used in veterinary medicine. It has close structural similarity to testosterone, and like methyltestosterone has a methyl group at C17α in order to increase oral bioavailability.In addition, it is also 7α-methylated, similar to its 7β-methylated isomer calusterone.The medication has a low to moderate ratio of anabolic to androgenic activity, similar to that of fluoxymesterone.Bolasterone is on the World Anti-Doping Agency's list of prohibited substances,and is therefore banned from use in most major sports."
933,"Haloxazolam (marketed in Japan under the brand name Somelin), is a drug which is a benzodiazepine derivative.It  is indicated for the treatment of insomnia. A study in cats comparing estazolam and haloxazolam found that haloxazolam only affects gamma motor neurons, whereas estazolam affects both alpha and gamma motor neurons."
934,"Used to decrease appetite.Cathine, also known as d-norpseudoephedrine and (+)-norpseudoephedrine, is a psychoactive drug with stimulant properties. It belongs to the phenethylamine and amphetamine chemical classes. In the United States, it is classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance.Closely related to ephedrine, cathinone and other amphetamines, it may contribute to the stimulant effect of Catha edulis, although another constituent, cathinone appears to show stronger activity."
935,"Similarly to other drugs in its class, it has antxiolytic, anticonvulsant, hypnotic, and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. However, impairment of cognition and disrupted sleep patterns will occur at doses higher than 40mg of carazepam. In the United States camazepam is regulated as a Schedule IV controlled substance.This binding of benzodiazepine receptors by camazepam and its active metabolites is responsible for its anticonvulsant effects. The anxiolytic properties of camazepam are also attributed to their ability to bind benzodiazepine receptors, also known as GABA receptors. When benzodiazepines bind to GABA receptors they increase the efficiency with which the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA binds."
936,Aminorex is an amphetamine-like anorectic agent. It may cause pulmonary hypertension.
937,"Etoxeridine (Carbetidine, Atenos) is a 4-phenylpiperidine derivative that is related to the clinically used opioid analgesic drug pethidine (meperidine).Etoxeridine was developed in the 1950s and investigated for use in surgical anesthesia, however it was never commercialized and is not currently used in medicine.As with other opioids which were not in clinical use during the drafting of the Controlled Substances Act, it is categorized as a Schedule I narcotic.
"
938,"Studies have found delorazepam to be more effective in the first 4 weeks of use than antidepressants; however, after 4 weeks, antidepressants showed superior anti-anxiety effects. Anti-anxiety effects also appear to be weaker in elderly patients. Effectiveness has also been observed in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal. Delorazepam is an active metabolite of the benzodiazepine known as cloxazolam. It is a long acting benzodiazepine which makes it superior in this sense to lorazepam which is short acting."
939,"Clostebol (INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name; also known as 4-chlorotestosterone) usually as the ester clostebol acetate, is a synthetic anabolic–androgenic steroid (AAS). Clostebol is the 4-chloro derivative of the natural hormone testosterone. The chlorination prevents conversion to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) while also rendering the chemical incapable of conversion to estrogen.Although usually used as an ester including clostebol acetate (Macrobin, Steranabol, Alfa-Trofodermin, Megagrisevit), clostebol caproate (Macrobin-Depot), or clostebol propionate (Yonchlon), unmodified/non-esterified clostebol is also reported to be marketed, under the brand name Trofodermin-S in Mexico.Clostebol is a weak AAS with potential use as a performance enhancing drug. It is currently banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency. Chlorodehydromethyltestosterone (Oral Turinabol), combining the chemical structures of clostebol and metandienone, was widely used in the East German state-sponsored doping program."
940,"Clortermine (Voranil) was developed by Ciba in the 1960s and is an anorectic drug of the amphetamine class.It is the 2-chloro analogue of the better known appetite suppressant phentermine, and is the 2-chloro positional isomer of chlorphentermine. Clortermine produces very low rates of self-administration in animals similarly to chlorphentermine,and as a result it likely does not act on dopamine. Instead, it may act as a serotonin and/or norepinephrine releasing agent."
941,An opioid analgesic structurally related to methadone and used in the treatment of severe pain.
942,Chlorhexadol is a sedative and hypnotic which is regulated in the United States as a Schedule III controlled substance. It is a derivative of chloral hydrate.Chloral hydrate has sedative/hypnotic activity which has been shown to extend the sleep of normal made adults via a dose-response relationship.
943,"Boldenone is an anabolic steroid developed for veterinary use, mostly for treatment of horses. It is not indicated for use in humans in the US and is only available through veterinary clinics.Boldenone has primarily anabolic activity with low androgenic potency. The drug is commonly used in doping within bodybuilding, even though this use is illegal. If intended to assist in bodybuilding, the drug is taken as part of a steroid stack of other anabolic steroids, usually with a potent androgen like testosterone as the 'base' of the stack. Androgens bind to the androgen receptor, which regulates gene transcription."
944,"For short-term treatment of severe insomnias, that are not responsive to other hypnotics.Flunitrazepam is a benzodiazepine with pharmacologic actions similar to those of diazepam that can cause anterograde amnesia. The United States Government has banned the importation of this drug.Flunitrazepam is a powerful hypnotic drug that is a benzodiazepine derivative. The drug is sometimes used as a date rape drug. In the United States, the drug has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for medical use, and is considered to be an illegal drug. As benzodiazepine receptors are thought to be coupled to gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptors, this enhances the effects of GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA receptor."
945,"Ethyl loflazepate(marketed under the brand names Meilax, Ronlax and Victan) is a drug which is a benzodiazepine derivative. It possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. In animal studies it was found to have low toxicity, although in rats evidence of pulmonary phospholipidosis occurred with pulmonary foam cells developing with long-term use of very high doses. Ethyl loflazepate was designed to be a prodrug for descarboxyloflazepate, its active metabolite. It is the active metabolite which is responsible for most of the pharmacological effects rather than ethyl loflazepate.The main metabolites of ethyl loflazepate are descarbethoxyloflazepate, loflazepate and 3-hydroxydescarbethoxyloflazepate.Accumulation of the active metabolites of ethyl loflazepate are not affected by those with kidney failure or impairment.The symptoms of an overdose of ethyl loflazepate include sleepiness, agitation and ataxia."
946,"In the 1960's, alpha-ethyltryptamine (αET), a non hydrazine reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor, was developed in the United States by the Upjohn chemical company for use as an antidepressant. However, in 1962, after the discovery of an unacceptable incidence of agranulocytosis, the development of Monase was halted and the drug was withdrawn from potential market use. In 1993, the US Drug Enforcement Administration added αET to Schedule I of its Schedules of Controlled Substances, after an increasing incidence of its use as a recreational drug in the 1980's. Like MDMA, increases in locomotor activity and mood elevation can be seen post administration.αET is a stimulant and psychedelic with MDMA like physiological effects. The ability to release serotonin was linked to αET's MDMA like properties."
947,"Drotebanol (Oxymethebanol) is a morphinan derivative that acts as an opioid agonist. It was invented by Sankyo Company in Japan during the 1970s. It is synthesised from thebaine.Drotebanol has powerful antitussive (cough suppressant) effects, and is around 10x more potent than codeine in producing this effect. It also has analgesic effects several times stronger than codeine, but weaker than morphine. In animal studies it was found to be moderately addictive and produced limited physical dependence, but not as severe as that seen with morphine or pethidine.It was previously marketed for human use under the brand name Metebanyl, although it is now no longer used in medicine.It is currently a Schedule I Narcotic controlled substance in the United States with a DEA ACSCN of 9335 and an annual aggregate manufacturing quota of zero."
948,"In some countries, such as Brazil, it is still prescribed -- often in the form of diet pills (ie. In the United States the sale of such diet pills has been banned due to concerns over side effects, and the risk of potentially fatal overdose. In the United States fenproporex was never approved by the FDA for clinical use due to a lack of efficacy and safety data, and is listed as a drug in Schedule IV of the Controlled Substances Act. Fenproporex is an amphetamine based anorectic which is rapidly metabolized into amphetamine in the body. Amphetamine based drugs are also known to reduce food intake."
949,"Dihydrocodeine is used for the treatment of moderate to severe pain, including post-operative and dental pain . It  can also be used to treat chronic pain , breathlessness and coughing. In heroin addicts, dihydrocodeine has been used as a substitute drug, in doses up to 2500mg/day to treat addiction.Dihydrocodeine is an opioid analgesic used as an alternative or adjunct to codeine to treat moderate to severe pain, severe dyspnea, and cough. It was marketed in 1911.Possible opioid related side effects include, but are not limited to, drowsiness, nausea, headache, dry mouth, constipation, difficulty passing urine, and mild euphoria. Dihydrocodeine is metabolized to dihydromorphine -- a highly active metabolite with a high affinity for mu opioid receptors."
950,"Typically used short term, and may be given as a single dose of up to 100mcg/kg to reduce anxiety and tension experienced prior to surgery. The usual dose of cloxazolam in adults is 3-12mg/day for anti-anxiety. As well, it has also been studied in Japan in doses of 15-30mg/day as an adjunct in the treatment of intractable epilepsy, for which it has demonstrated effectiveness.Studies have shown a superiority of 4mg/day of cloxazepam to 12mg/day of bromazepam in terms of anxiety, depressed mood, and sleep; an insignificant difference in terms of sedative effect; and less muscle relaxant effects. Cloxazolam, administered as a single oral dose of 3mg, when compared to a single 5 mg dose of diazepam in one study, showed similar subjective measures; however, there cloxazolam caused more fatigue, and less mood improvement. Cloxazolam also induced a significant increase in heart rate in the control group of this study."
951,"For the short-term treatment of insomnia, short-term treatment of anxiety or panic attacks, if a benzodiazepine is required, and the alleviation of the symptoms of alcohol- and opiate-withdrawal.One of the benzodiazepines that is used in the treatment of anxiety disorders. It is a intermediate-acting benzodiazepine.Bromazepam is a lipophilic, long-acting benzodiazepine and with sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. It does not possess any antidepressant qualities. According to many psychiatric experts, Bromazepam has a greater abuse potential than other benzodiazepines because of fast resorption and rapid onset of action.Bromazepam binds to the GABA-A receptor producing a conformational change and potentiating its inhibitory effects. Other neurotransmitters are not influenced."
952,"For the treatment of anxiety disorders.Clotiazepam is a thienodiazepine, not approved for sale in the U.S. or Canada, but has been approved in the U.K. It is a schedule IV drug in Canada.Clotiazepam is a thienodiazepine possessing anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. It increases the stage 2 non-rapid eye movement sleep.Clotiazepam acts at the benzodiazepine receptors (BZD). This agonizes the action of GABA, increasing the frequency of opening of the channel chlorinates and penetration of the ions chlorinates through the ionophore. Increase in membrane polarization decreases the probability of discharge of neurons."
953,"Mainly used as a hypnotic in the treatment of insomnia; however, it is only effective as a hypnotic for short-term use. May be used as a routine sedative preoperatively to decrease anxiety and cause sedation and/or sleep with respiration depression or cough reflex. A hypnotic and sedative used in the treatment of insomnia. The safety margin is too narrow for chloral hydrate to be used as a general anesthetic in humans, but it is commonly used for that purpose in animal experiments. It is no longer considered useful as an anti-anxiety medication."
954,"Used for the short-term treatment of anxiety disorders.Fludiazepam is a drug which is a benzodiazepine derivative. It possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. It is a scheduled drug in the U.S., but is approved for use in Japan.Fludiazepam is a benzodiazepine derivative. It possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. Fludiazepam accumulates primarily in the cortex and thalamus. Fludiazepam has similar action to diazepam, but binds with four times more affinity to benzodiazepine receptors than diazepam. "
955,"Dextroamphetamine is indicated for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).Dextroamphetamine is the dextrorotatory enantiomer of amphetamine. Dextroamphetamine was approved by the FDA in 2001 for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.Dextroamphetamine is a noncatecholamine, sympathomimetic amine that acts as a CNS stimulant. The general mechanism of action of dextroamphetamine has not been well established.The exact mechanism of amphetamines as a class is not known. Dextroamphetamine acts by preventing reuptake, increasing release, and stimulating reverse-transport of dopamine in synaptic clefts in the striatum. Newer evidence shows amphetamines may also alter the number of dopamine transporters in synaptic clefts."
956,"Phendimetrazine is chemically related to amphetamines and is a Schedule III drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances and in the US since 1970.Phendimetrazine is a phenylalkylamine sympathomimetic amine with pharmacological activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, the amphetamines. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance has been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as ''anorectics or anorexigenics."" It has not been established, however, that the action of such drugs in treating obesity is primarily one of appetite suppression. Other central nervous system actions or metabolic effects, may be involved.Phendimetrazine may act in a similar way to amphetamines in that it activates the alpha-adrenergic system to induce an appetite suppressive and metabolic increase effect."
957,"A sulfanilamide that is used as an antibacterial agent. It can be used to treat bronchitis, prostatitis and urinary tract infections.A sulfanilamide that is used as an antibacterial agent.Sulfonamides act as competitive inhibitors of the enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase (DHPS), an enzyme involved in folate synthesis in bacteria.Sulfamerazine is a sulfonamide drug that inhibits bacterial synthesis of dihydrofolic acid by competing with para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) for binding to dihydropteroate synthetase (dihydrofolate synthetase). Sulfamerazine is bacteriostatic in nature. Inhibition of dihydrofolic acid synthesis decreases the synthesis of bacterial nucleotides and DNA."
958,"May also be used to suppress thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion in patients with simple (nontoxic) goiter, subacute or chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis multinodular goiter, and in the management of thyroid cancer.May also be used for differential diagnosis of suspected mild hyperthyroidism or thyroid gland autonomy.Liotrix is a synthetically derived thyroid hormone replacement preparation. It is now known that the thyroid gland secretes approximately ten times more T4 than T3 and that 80% of serum T3 is derived from deiodination of T4 in peripheral tissues. These hormones enhance oxygen consumption by most tissues of the body and increase the basal metabolic rate and the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins. Thus, they exert a profound influence on every organ system in the body and are of particular importance in the development of the central nervous system.The hormones, T4 and T3, are tyrosine-based hormones produced by the thyroid gland. Thyroid hormones are essential for proper development and differentiation of all cells of the human body."
959,"Ursodeoxycholic acid is indicated for the treatment of patients with primary biliary cholangitis. It is also used to prevent gallstone formation in obese patients experiencing rapid weight loss.Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), also known as ursodiol, is a naturally-occurring bile acid that constitutes a minor fraction of the human bile acid pool. UDCA works by replacing the hydrophobic or more toxic bile acids from the bile acid pool.Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is a secondary bile acid with cytoprotectant, immunomodulating, and choleretic effects. UDCA increases bile acid flow and promotes the secretion of bile acids.Endogenous hydrophobic bile acids such as deoxycholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid can exert hepatotoxic effects. It increases the absorption of hydrophilic bile acids."
960,"For the treatment of anxiety disorders.Prazepam is a benzodiazepine that is used in the treatment of anxiety disorders. It is a schedule IV drug in the U.S.Prazepam is a benzodiazepine derivative with anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant activity. Benzodiazepines may be habit-forming (causing mental or physical dependence), especially when taken for a long time or in high doses.Prazepam is believed to stimulate GABA receptors in the ascending reticular activating system. Since GABA is inhibitory, receptor stimulation increases inhibition and blocks both cortical and limbic arousal following stimulation of the brain stem reticular formation."
961,"It was first approved in the US in 1985 and is used as a hypnotic for the treatment of insomnia. It appears to be unique amongst other benzodiazepine derivatives in its relatively high affinity for sleep-promoting α1 subunit-containing GABAA receptors and low affinity for other receptors.Benzodiazepines, including quazepam, exert their sedative and anxiolytic effects by potentiating the effects of endogenous GABA, the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system.Like other benzodiazepines, quazepam likely exerts its effects by potentiating the effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on GABA(A) receptors, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the mammalian brain. GABA(A) receptors are a component of GABA-gated ionotropic chloride channels that produce inhibitory postsynaptic potentials - following activation by GABA, the channel undergoes a conformational change that allows the passage of chloride ions through the channel. Benzodiazepines are positive allosteric modulators of GABA(A) function. They bind to the interface between alpha (α) and gamma (γ) subunits on the receptor, commonly referred to as the benzodiazepine binding site, and modulate the receptor such that its inhibitory response to GABA binding is dramatically increased."
962,"Indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after failure of treatment with sunitinib or sorafenib. Indicated in pediatric and adult patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) for the treatment of subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) that requires therapeutic intervention but cannot be curatively resected.Everolimus is a derivative of Rapamycin (sirolimus), and works similarly to Rapamycin as an mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor. It is currently used as an immunosuppressant to prevent rejection of organ transplants. In a similar fashion to other mTOR inhibitors Everolimus' effect is solely on the mTORC1 protein and not on the mTORC2 protein.Everolimus is a mTOR inhibitor that binds with high affinity to the FK506 binding protein-12 (FKBP-12), thereby forming a drug complex that inhibits the activation of mTOR. This inhibition reduces the activity of effectors downstream, which leads to a blockage in the progression of cells from G1 into S phase, and subsequently inducing cell growth arrest and apoptosis."
963,"Solifenacin tablets are indicated to treat an overactive bladder with urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency.Solifenacin is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist indicated to treat an overactive bladder with urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency. It has a long duration of action as it is usually taken once daily. It has a long duration of action as it is usually taken once daily. It has the highest affinity for M3, M1, and M2 muscarinic receptors. 80% of the muscarinic receptors in the bladder are M2, while 20% are M3."
964,"For the management of anxiety disorders or for the short-term relief of the symptoms of anxiety or anxiety associated with depressive symptoms.Cinolazepam is a benzodiazepine derivative with anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant activity. It is not approved in Canada or America.Cinolazepam is a benzodiazepine derivative with anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant activity. It is not approved in Canada or America.Cinolazepam binds to central benzodiazepine receptors which interact allosterically with GABA receptors. This potentiates the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, increasing the inhibition of the ascending reticular activating system and blocking the cortical and limbic arousal that occurs following stimulation of the reticular pathways."
965,"Used to treat short-term sleeping problems (insomnia), such as difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings during the night, and early-morning awakening.A benzodiazepine derivative used as an anticonvulsant and hypnotic.Nitrazepam is a type of benzodiazepine drug. It is a powerful hypnotic drug which possesses strong sedative, anxiolytic, amnestic, anticonvulsant, and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. Nitrazepam shortens the time required to fall asleep and lengthens the duration of sleep. It is also useful for the management of myoclonic seizures.Nitrazepam belongs to a group of medicines called benzodiazepines. This drug affects central benzodiazepine receptors, which are associated with inhibitory GABA (gamma amino butyric acid)receptors, leading to enhanced GABA binding activity."
966,"Used to lower LDL and HDL cholesterol.A drug used to lower LDL and HDL cholesterol yet has little effect on serum-triglyceride or VLDL cholesterol. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p993).Probucol lowers cholesterol levels by increasing LDL (low-density lipoprotein) breakdown. Additionally, probucol may inhibit cholesterol synthesis and delay cholesterol absorption. Probucol is a powerful antioxidant drug normally used to prevent vascular disease caused by the free radicals in the body.Probucol lowers serum cholesterol by increasing the fractional rate of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) catabolism in the final metabolic pathway for cholesterol elimination from the body. This drug may also act to inhibit the initial stages of cholesterol synthesis and act to inhibit the absorption of cholesterol from the diet."
967,"Like many other protease inhibitors (e.g. , ), lopinavir is a peptidomimetic molecule - it contains a hydroxyethylene scaffold that mimics the peptide linkage typically targeted by the HIV-1 protease enzyme but which itself cannot be cleaved, thus preventing the activity of the HIV-1 protease. At the center of this lifecycle is the Gag polyprotein which, along with the products of its proteolysis, coordinate these stages and function as the major structural proteins of the virus. The HIV-1 protease enzyme, a dimeric aspartic protease, is the enzyme responsible for cleaving the Gag polyprotein and thus plays a critical role in many aspects of the HIV viral lifecycle. Lopinavir is an inhibitor of the HIV-1 protease enzyme. By preventing HIV-1 protease activity, and thus the proteolysis of the Gag polyprotein, lopinavir results in the production of immature, non-infectious viral particles."
968,"Used to treat infections due to mecillinam-sensitive organisms such as urinary tract infections, salmonellosis and typhoid fever.Pivmecillinam is a mecillinam prodrug, a pivaloyloxymethyl ester of amdinocillin that is well absorbed orally, but broken down to amdinocillin in the intestinal mucosa. It is active against gram-negative organisms and used as for amdinocillin. Pivmecillinam  is a pivaloyloxymethyl ester of amdinocillin that is well absorbed orally, but broken down to amdinocillin in the intestinal mucosa. It is active against gram-negative organisms and used as for amdinocillin.Pivmecillinam interferes with the biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall however its activity is slightly different from that of other penicillins and cephalosporins"
969,"Certain gram-negative bacilli infections with beta-lactamase producing organisms cannot be treated with piperacillin-tazobactam, due to a gene mutation conferring antibiotic resistance. **Tazobactam-ceftolozane**    Tazobactam is used in combination with  for the treatment of infections caused by designated susceptible microorganisms in adult and pediatric patients:    - Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections (cIAI), used in combination with   - Complicated Urinary Tract Infections (cUTI), including pyelonephritis  - Hospital-acquired Bacterial Pneumonia and Ventilator-associated Bacterial Pneumonia (HABP/VABP)Tazobactam is an antibiotic of the beta-lactamase inhibitor class that prevents the breakdown of other antibiotics by beta-lactamase enzyme producing organisms. In June 2019, ceftolozane-tazobactam was approved by the FDA for treating hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia, which are significant causes of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients.Tazobactam inhibits the action of bacterial beta-lactamase producing organisms, which are normally resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. This occurs through the irreversible inhibition of beta-lactamase enzymes. In addition, tazobactam may bind covalently to plasmid-mediated and chromosome-mediated beta-lactamase enzymes."
970,"For use as adjunctive medication in some psychotic patients. Periciazine is a phenothiazine of the piperidine group. It has been shown to reduce pathologic arousal and affective tension in some psychotic patients, while the symptoms of abnormal mental integration are relatively unaffected. It is used as an adjunctive medication in some psychotic patients, for the control of residual prevailing hostility, impulsiveness and aggressiveness. It also has adrenolytic, anticholinergic, metabolic and endocrine effects, and an action on the extrapyramidal system.Pericyazine, like other phenothiazines, is presumed to act principally in the subcortical areas, by producing what has been described as a central adrenergic blockade of the alpha adrenergic receptors as well as antagonism of the D(1) dopamine receptor."
971,"For the treatment of chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions (transfusional hemosiderosis) in patients 2 years of age and older.Deferasirox is an iron chelator and the first oral medication FDA approved for chronic iron overload in patients receiving long term blood transfusions.Deferasirox is an orally active chelator that is selective for iron (as Fe3+). It is a tridentate ligand that binds iron with high affinity in a 2:1 ratio. Although deferasirox has very low affinity for zinc and copper there are variable decreases in the serum concentration of these trace metals after the administration of deferasirox. The clinical significance of these decreases is uncertain.Two molecules of deferasirox are capable of binding to 1 atom of iron. Deferasirox works in treating iron toxicity by binding trivalent (ferric) iron (for which it has a strong affinity), forming a stable complex which is eliminated via the kidneys."
972,"After oral administration, it is rapidly converted to ganciclovir by intestinal and hepatic esterases.Valganciclovir is an antiviral medication used to treat cytomegalovirus infections. This results in the termination of the elongation of viral DNA.Valganciclovir is a prodrug of ganciclovir that exists as a mixture of two diastereomers. In cytomegalovirus (CMV)-infected cells, ganciclovir is initially phosphorylated to the monophosphate form by viral protein kinase, then it is further phosphorylated via cellular kinases to produce the triphosphate form. This results in the prevention of DNA synthesis, as phosphodiester bridges can longer to be built, destabilizing the strand. Ganciclovir inhibits viral DNA polymerases more effectively than it does cellular polymerase, and chain elongation resumes when ganciclovir is removed."
973,"Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are both being investigated for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Altering the pH of the lysosomes reduces low-affinity self-antigen presentation in autoimmune diseases and interferes with the ability of plasmodia to proteolyze hemoglobin for their energy requirements. Hydroxychloroquine is not effective against malaria in areas where chloroquine resistance has been reported.The exact mechanisms of hydroxychloroquine are unknown. It has been shown that hydroxychloroquine accumulates in the lysosomes of the malaria parasite, raising the pH of the vacuole. Hydroxychloroquine inhibits terminal glycosylation of ACE2, the receptor that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 target for cell entry."
974,"For the rapid relief of angina pectoris.Amyl Nitrite is an antihypertensive medicine. Amyl nitrite is employed medically to treat heart diseases such as angina and to treat cyanide poisoning. Its use as a prescription medicine comes from its ability to lower blood pressure. As an inhalant, it also has psychoactive effect which has led to illegal drug use.Amyl nitrite, in common with other alkyl nitrites, is a potent vasodilator. Alkyl nitrite functions as a source of nitric oxide, which signals for relaxation of the involuntary muscles."
975,"Acepromazine was first used in humans in the 1950s as an antipsychotic agent. It is now rarely used in humans. Acepromazine is frequently used in animals as a sedative and antiemetic. Its principal value is in quietening and calming anxious animals.Acepromazine is one of the phenothiazine derivative psychotropic drugs, used little in humans, however frequently in animals as a sedative and antiemetic.Acepromazine is one of the phenothiazine derivative psychotropic drugs. Acepromazine has actions at all levels of the central nervous system-primarily at subcortical levels-as well as on multiple organ systems."
976,"Molindone is used for the management of the manifestations of psychotic disorders.An indole derivative effective in schizophrenia and other psychoses and possibly useful in the treatment of the aggressive type of undersocialized conduct disorder. Molindone has much lower affinity for D2 receptors than most antipsychotic agents and has a relatively low affinity for D1 receptors. It has only low to moderate affinity for cholinergic and alpha-adrenergic receptors. Molindone has a pharmacological profile in laboratory animals which predominantly resembles that of major tranquilizers causing reduction of spontaneous locomotion and aggressiveness, suppression of a conditioned response and antagonism of the bizarre stereotyped behavior and hyperactivity induced by amphetamines. In addition, molindone antagonizes the depression caused by the tranquilizing agent tetrabenazine.The exact mechanism has not been established, however, based on electroencephalogram (EEG) studies, molindone is thought to act by occupying (antagonizing) dopamine (D2) receptor sites in the reticular limbic systems in the brain, thus decreasing dopamine activity."
977,"Used to treat sneezing, runny nose, itching, watery eyes, hives, rashes, itching, and other symptoms of allergies and the common cold.Phenindamine is an antihistamine. Phenindamine blocks the effects of the naturally occurring chemical histamine in your body. The antihistamines antagonize those pharmacological effects of histamine which are mediated through activation of H1- receptor sites and thereby reduce the intensity of allergic reactions and tissue injury response involving histamine release. Phenindamine blocks the effects of the naturally occurring chemical histamine in your body. By inhibiting the binding of histamine, antihistamines decrease the normal histamine response from cells, consequently decreasing allergic symptoms.Antihistamines such as phenindamine appear to compete with histamine for histamine H1- receptor sites on effector cells."
978,"For the maintenance treatment of chronic non-agitated schizophrenic patients.Pipotiazine has actions similar to those of other phenothiazines. Among the different phenothiazine derivatives, it appears to be less sedating and to have a weak propensity for causing hypotension or potentiating the effects of CNS depressants and anesthetics. However, it produces a high incidence of extra pyramidal reactions. Among the different phenothiazine derivatives, it appears to be less sedating and to have a weak propensity for causing hypotension or potentiating the effects of CNS depressants and anesthetics. However, it produces a high incidence of extra pyramidal reactions."
979,"For the treatment of all types of acute and chronic schizophrenia, including those which did not respond to the usual neuroleptics; manic syndromes.Thioproperazine is a potent neuroleptic with antipsychotic properties. Thioproperazine has a marked cataleptic and antiapomorphine activity associated with relatively slight sedative, hypothermic and spasmolytic effects. It is virtually without antiserotonin and hypotensive action and has no antihistaminic property. It is used for the  treatment of all types of acute and chronic schizophrenia, including those which did not respond to the usual neuroleptics; manic syndromes.Thioproperazine is a potent neuroleptic with antipsychotic properties. Thioproperazine has a marked cataleptic and antiapomorphine activity associated with relatively slight sedative, hypothermic and spasmolytic effects."
980,"For the management of schizophrenia.A thioxanthine used as an antipsychotic agent. Its effects are similar to the phenothiazine antipsychotics.Thiothixene is an antipsychotic of the thioxanthene series. Navane possesses certain chemical and pharmacological similarities to the piperazine phenothiazines and differences from the aliphatic group of phenothiazines. Although widely used in the treatment of schizophrenia for several decades, thiothixene is seldom used today in favor of atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone.Thiothixene acts as an antagonist (blocking agent) on different postsysnaptic receptors -on dopaminergic-receptors (subtypes D1, D2, D3 and D4 - different antipsychotic properties on productive and unproductive symptoms), on serotonergic-receptors (5-HT1 and 5-HT2, with anxiolytic, antidepressive and antiaggressive properties as well as an attenuation of extrapypramidal side-effects, but also leading to weight gain, fall in blood pressure, sedation and ejaculation difficulties), on histaminergic-receptors (H1-receptors, sedation, antiemesis, vertigo, fall in blood pressure and weight gain), alpha1/alpha2-receptors (antisympathomimetic properties, lowering of blood pressure, reflex tachycardia, vertigo, sedation, hypersalivation and incontinence as well as sexual dysfunction, but may also attenuate pseudoparkinsonism - controversial) and finally on muscarinic (cholinergic) M1/M2-receptors (causing anticholinergic symptoms like dry mouth, blurred vision, obstipation, difficulty/inability to urinate, sinus tachycardia, ECG-changes and loss of memory, but the anticholinergic action may attenuate extrapyramidal side-effects)."
981,"Zuclopenthixol acetate is not intended for long-term use.Zuclopenthixol, also known as Zuclopentixol or Zuclopenthixolum, is an antipsychotic agent. It is an antagonist at D1 and D2 dopamine receptors. Zuclopenthixol was approved for use in Canada in 2011, but is not approved for use in the United States.Zuclopenthixol is a thioxanthene with therapeutic actions similar to the phenothiazine antipsychotics. It is an antagonist at D1 and D2 dopamine receptors.Zuclopenthixol is a typical antipsychotic neuroleptic drug of the thioxanthene class. It mainly acts by antagonism of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors."
982,"For the treatment of moderate to severe hypertension.Pargyline is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor with antihypertensive properties.Pargyline is a monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor with antihypertensive properties. Patients taking pargyline must avoid concurrent consumption of tyramine-containing foods such as bleu cheese and beer, as this can lead to a hypertensive crisis.MAOIs act by inhibiting the activity of monoamine oxidase, thus preventing the breakdown of monoamine neurotransmitters and thereby increasing their availability. There are two isoforms of monoamine oxidase, MAO-A and MAO-B. MAO-A preferentially deaminates serotonin, melatonin, epinephrine and norepinephrine. MAO-B preferentially deaminates phenylethylamine and trace amines."
983,"As with all antibacterial agents, lincomycin should only be used to treat infections proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria.Lincomycin is a lincosamide antibiotic first isolated from the soil bacterium Streptomyces lincolnensis in Lincoln, Nebraska. Clinical use of lincomycin has largely been superseded by its semisynthetic derivative  due to its higher efficacy and a wider range of susceptible organisms, though lincomycin remains in use. It is also effective against anaerobic bacteria, though in this regard  is generally more potent. Lincomycin for injection may contain benzyl alcohol as a preservative, which has been associated with gasping syndrome in pediatric patients. Like all antibiotics, lincomycin use may cause overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, which should be considered.Lincomycin contains the unusual amino acid moiety propyl hygric acid linked to the sugar moiety α-methylthiolincosamine (α-MTL) that, like other lincosamides, functions as a structural analogue of the 3' end of L-Pro-Met-tRNA and deacylated-tRNA to interact with the 23S rRNA of the 50S bacterial ribosomal subunit."
984,"For the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, chronic low back pain, acute pain and gout.Etoricoxib is a new COX-2 selective inhibitor. Current therapeutic indications are: treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, chronic low back pain, acute pain and gout. Like any other COX-2 selective inhibitor, Etoricoxib selectively inhibits isoform 2 of cyclo-oxigenase enzyme (COX-2) to reduce the generation of prostaglandins (PGs) from arachidonic acid. It is approved in more than 60 countries worldwide but not in the US.Etoricoxib is a COX-2 selective inhibitor (approximately 106 times more selective for COX-2 inhibition over COX-1).Like any other COX-2 selective inhibitor Etoricoxib selectively inhibits isoform 2 of cyclo-oxigenase enzyme (COX-2), preventing production of prostaglandins (PGs) from arachidonic acid."
985,"Used as a non-stimulant laxative via an oral suspension or enema.A polyhydric alcohol with about half the sweetness of sucrose. Sorbitol occurs naturally and is also produced synthetically from glucose. It was formerly used as a diuretic and may still be used as a laxative and in irrigating solutions for some surgical procedures.Sorbitol exerts its laxative effect by drawing water into the large intestine, thereby stimulating bowel movements."
986,"Oral roflumilast is indicated to reduce the risk of COPD exacerbations in patients with severe COPD associated with chronic bronchitis and a history of exacerbations. Topical cream roflumilast is indicated to treat plaque psoriasis, including intertriginous areas, in patients 12 years of age and older, while topical foam roflumilast is indicated to treat seborrheic dermatitis in adult and pediatric patients 9 years of age and older..Roflumilast is a highly selective phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor. The resultant increase in intracellular cAMP induced by roflumilast's inhibition of PDE4 is thought to mediate its disease-modifying effects, although its precise mechanism of action has yet to be elucidated. On December 15, 2023, the FDA approved a new topical foam formulation of roflumilast for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis in patients aged 9 years and older.Roflumilast and its active metabolite, roflumilast N-oxide, increase cyclic adenosine-3′, 5′-monophosphate (cAMP) in affected cells by inhibiting PDE4. Roflumilast and its active metabolite (roflumilast N-oxide) are inhibitors of PDE4."
987,"Taking DHEA by mouth daily seems to improve bone mineral density (BMD) in older women and men with osteoporosis or osteopenia (pre-osteoporosis). DHEA is often prescribed in India for the induction of ovulation to improve chances of pregnancy.Prasterone, also known as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a major C19 steroid produced by the adrenal cortex. In the United States, DHEA or DHEAS have been advertised with claims that they may be beneficial for a wide variety of ailments. Some theorize that the increase in endogenous DHEA brought about by calorie restriction is partially responsible for the longer life expectancy known to be associated with calorie restriction.DHEA can be understood as a prohormone for the sex steroids. As most DHEA is produced by the zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex, it is argued that there is a role in the immune and stress response."
988,"For the treatment of bacterial infections (usually in combination with quinupristin).Dalfopristin is a combination of two antibiotics (Dalfopristin and quinupristin) used to treat infections by staphylococci and by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. It is not effective against Enterococcus faecalis infections. Dalfopristin inhibits the early phase of protein synthesis in the bacterial ribosome and quinupristin inhibits the late phase of protein synthesis.Dalfopristin is a streptogramin antibiotic, derived from pristinamycin IIA. The site of action of dalfopristin is the bacterial ribosome. Dalfopristin   has been shown to inhibit the early phase of protein synthesis."
989,"Studied for the treatment of many uses such as treatment of testicular torsion, diabetic ulceration, wound healing, acne, obesity, diabetic peripheral polyneuropathy. It has also been investigated for its hypolipidemic effects and as cholesterol lowering agent.Pantothenic acid, also called pantothenate or vitamin B5 (a B vitamin), is a water-soluble vitamin discovered by Roger J. Williams in 1919. CoA is thought to act as a carrier molecule, allowing the entry of acyl groups into cells. This is of critical importance as these acyl groups are used as substrates in the tricarboxylic acid cycle to generate energy and in the synthesis of fatty acids, cholesterol, and acetylcholine. Additionally, CoA is part of acyl carrier protein (ACP), which is required in the synthesis of fatty acids in addition to CoAs use as a substrate."
990,"For the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with the menopause, atrophic vaginitis, osteoporosis, hypoestrogenism due to hypogonadism, castration, primary ovarian failure, breast cancer (for palliation only), and Advanced androgen-dependent carcinoma of the prostate (for palliation only)An estrogenic steroid produced by horses. It has a total of four double bonds in the A- and B-ring. High concentration of equilin is found in the urine of pregnant mares.Equilin is a component of Premarin (conjugated estrogens), a mixture of the water soluble salts of sulfate esters from estrone, equilin, 17 alpha-dihydroequilin, and other related steroids, may be derived from pregnant equine urine or yam and soy plants. Estrogens are important in the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sex characteristics. They promote growth and development of the vagina, uterus, and fallopian tubes, and enlargement of the breasts."
991,"An anthranilic acid derivative with analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties. It is used in musculoskeletal and joint disorders and administered by mouth and topically."
992,"For the treatment of moderate plaque psoriasis in adults.Calcipotriol (INN) or calcipotriene (USAN) is a sythetic derivative of calcitriol or Vitamin D.Calcipotriene is a synthetic analog of vitamin D. In humans, the natural supply of vitamin D depends mainly on exposure to the ultraviolet rays of the sun for conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) in the skin. The precise mechanism of calcipotriol in remitting psoriasis is not well-understood, however, it has been shown to have comparable affinity with calcitriol for the Vitamin D receptor while being less than 1% the activity in regulating calcium metabolism. The Vitamin D receptor (VDR) belongs to the steroid/thyroid receptor superfamily, and is found on the cells of many different tissues including the thyroid, bone, kindney, and T cells of the immune system. T cells are known to play a role in psoriasis and are believed to undergo modulation of gene expression with binding of calcipotriol to the VDR. This modulation is thought to affect gene products related to cell differentiation and proliferation."
993,A member of the vitamin B complex. It used to be common in sunscreening agents until found to also be a sensitizer. The potassium salt is used therapeutically in fibrotic skin disorders.
994,"For the pharmacological control of certain diabetic complications.Tolrestat (INN) (AY-27773) is an aldose reductase inhibitor which was approved for the control of certain diabetic complications. While it was approved for marketed in several countries, it failed a Phase III trial in the U.S. due to toxicity and never received FDA approval. It was sold under the tradename Alredase but was discontinued by Wyeth in 1997 because of the risk of severe liver toxicity and death."
995,The most common inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system.
996,"For the treatment of cutaneous manifestations in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma who have progressive, persistent or recurrent disease on or following two systemic therapies.Vorinostat (rINN) or suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), is a drug currently under investigation for the treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL), a type of skin cancer, to be used when the disease persists, gets worse, or comes back during or after treatment with other medicines. It is the first in a new class of agents known as histone deacetylase inhibitors. A recent study suggested that vorinostat also possesses some activity against recurrent glioblastoma multiforme, resulting in a median overall survival of 5.7 months (compared to 4 - 4.4 months in earlier studies). Further brain tumor trials are planned using combinations of vorinostat with other drugs.Vorinostat inhibits the enzymatic activity of histone deacetylases HDAC1, HDAC2 and HDAC3 (Class I) and HDAC6 (Class II) at nanomolar concentrations (IC50&lt; 86 nM). These enzymes catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from the lysine residues of histones proteins."

1000,"For the treatment of bacterial infections.An antibiotic isolated from the fermentation broth of Fusidium coccineum. (From Merck Index, 11th ed) It acts by inhibiting translocation during protein synthesis. It is often used topically in creams and eyedrops but is available in systemic formulations including tablets and injections.Fusidic acid is a bacteriostatic antibiotic and helps prevent bacterial growth while the immune system clears the infection.Fusidic acid works by interfering with bacterial protein synthesis, specifically by preventing the translocation of the elongation factor G (EF-G) from the ribosome. It also can inhibit chloramphenicol acetyltransferase enzymes."
1001,"A potent androgenic metabolite of testosterone. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is generated by a 5-alpha reduction of testosterone. Unlike testosterone, DHT cannot be aromatized to estradiol therefore DHT is considered a pure androgenic steroid."
1002,"Piretanide (INN, trade names Arelix, Eurelix, Tauliz) has been synthesized in 1973 at Hoechst AG (Germany) as a loop diuretic compound by using a then-new method for introducing cyclic amine residues in an aromatic nucleus in the presence of other aromatically bonded functional groups."
1003,"For use as an antidepressant, appetite suppressant, and sleep aid.5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), also known as oxitriptan (INN), is a naturally occurring amino acid and metabolic intermediate in the synthesis of serotonin and melatonin. 5-HTP is sold over-the-counter in the United Kingdom, United States and Canada as a dietary supplement for use as an antidepressant, appetite suppressant, and sleep aid, and is also marketed in many European countries for the indication of major depression under trade names like Cincofarm, Levothym, Levotonine, Oxyfan, Telesol, Tript-OH, and Triptum. Several double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of 5-HTP in the treatment of depression, though a lack of high quality studies has been noted. More study is needed to determine efficacy in treating depression.The psychoactive action of 5-HTP is thought to be due to increased serotonin production in central nervous system tissue."
1004,An alpha-glucosidase inhibitor with antiviral action. Derivatives of deoxynojirimycin may have anti-HIV activity.
1005,"Oteracil is used as an adjunct to antineoplastic therapy. When used within the product Teysuno, oteracil is indicated for the treatment of adults with advanced gastric (stomach) cancer when given in combination with cisplatin.Oteracil is an adjunct to antineoplastic therapy, used to reduce the toxic side effects associated with chemotherapy. The main active ingredient in Teysuno is , a pro-drug of  (5-FU), which is a cytotoxic anti-metabolite drug that acts on rapidly dividing cancer cells. By mimicking a class of compounds called ""pyrimidines"" that are essential components of RNA and DNA, 5-FU is able to insert itself into strands of DNA and RNA, thereby halting the replication process necessary for continued cancer growth. It functions by blocking the enzyme orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRT), which is involved in the production of 5-FU.Oteracil's main role within Teysuno is to reduce the activity of 5-FU within normal gastrointestinal mucosa, and therefore reduce's gastrointestinal toxicity ."
1006,"Phenol is primarily indicated for minor sore throat pain, sore mouth, minor mouth irritation, and pain associated with canker sores. Additionally, phenol is indicated in the treatment of focal spasticity. It is active against a wide range of micro-organisms including some fungi and viruses, but is only slowly effective against spores. Phenol is also used as an oral analgesic or anesthetic in products such as Chloraseptic to treat pharyngitis. Additionally, phenol and its related compounds are used in surgical ingrown toenail treatment, a process termed phenolization."
1007,"Aliskirin is a second-generation renin inhibitor, and a new generation of non peptide renin blockers. It can block the RAS system in the first stage, reduce renin activity, reduce the production of AngII and aldosterone, and do not affect the metabolism of bradykinin and prostaglandins. It plays a role in lowering blood pressure and treating cardiovascular diseases. From current research, it appears that Aligilen is a powerful, highly selective, orally effective, and long-lasting next-generation antihypertensive drug. The drug acts in a renin dependent manner, so increasing the dosage will only prolong the time and will not cause a sudden drop in blood pressure, similar to ARB (losartan, telmisartan)."
1008,"Ribostamycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic isolated from _Streptomyces ribosidificus_ listed as one of the World Health Organization's critically important antimicrobials.Aminoglycosides work by binding to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit (some work by binding to the 50S subunit), inhibiting the translocation of the peptidyl-tRNA from the A-site to the P-site and also causing misreading of mRNA, leaving the bacterium unable to synthesize proteins vital to its growth. However, their exact mechanism of action is not fully known."
1009,"Used principally as an analgesic.Phenacetin was withdrawn from the Canadian market in June 1973 due to concerns regarding nephropathy (damage to or disease of the kidney).Phenacetin was the first NSAID and fever reducer to go on the market. It acts as an analgesic at the spinal cord as well as a negative inotrope at the heart. It can be used to treat subacute rheumatoid arthritis, intercostal neuralgia, and ataxias."

Latamoxef  is primarily indicated in conditions like Bone and joint infection, GI infections, Gynecological infections, Meningitis, Respiratory tract infections, Septicaemia, Skin infections, Soft tissue infections, UTI. Latamoxef is a broad- spectrum beta-lactam antibiotic similar in structure to the cephalosporins except for the substitution of an oxaazabicyclo moiety for the thiaazabicyclo moiety of certain cephalosporins. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that amoxicllin interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."
1013,"Also, when high dose chemotherapy with HPCT support it is appropriate for the treatment of solid tumours in adult and paediatric patients.N,N'N'-triethylenethiophosphoramide (ThioTEPA) is a cancer chemotherapeutic member of the alkylating agent group, now in use for over 50 years. It is a stable derivative of N,N',N''- triethylenephosphoramide (TEPA). Its main toxicity is myelosuppression.The unstable nitrogen-carbon groups alkylate with DNA causing irrepairable DNA damage. They stop tumor growth by crosslinking guanine nucleobases in DNA double-helix strands, directly attacking DNA. These drugs act nonspecifically.The alkyl group is attached to the guanine base of DNA, at the number 7 nitrogen atom of the imidazole ring."
1014,"Used as a test to determine the general health of an unborn fetus.A hydroxylated metabolite of estradiol or estrone that has a hydroxyl group at C3-beta, 16-alpha, and 17-beta position. Though estriol is used as part of the primarily North American phenomenon of bioidentical hormone replacement therapy, it is not approved for use by the FDA or Health Canada. It is only produced in significant amounts during pregnancy as it is made by the placenta. If levels of ""unconjugated estriol"" are abnormally low in a pregnant woman, this may indicate a problem with the development of the child. The drug interacts with a target cell receptor."
1015,"Used in hormone replacement therapy, treating symptoms of menopause such as hot flashes. Also used to treat breast and prostate cancer.The 3-cyclopentyl ether of ethinyl estradiol.Quinestrol is the 3-cyclopentyl ether of ethinyl estradiol (the active metabolite). Ethinyl estradiol is a synthetic derivative of the natural estrogen estradiol.Estrogens diffuse into their target cells and interact with a protein receptor (the estrogen receptor). Estrogen interacts with a target cell receptor. Estrogens increase the hepatic synthesis of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), thyroid-binding globulin (TBG), and other serum proteins and suppress follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary."
1016,"Fleroxacin is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial fluoroquinolone.Fleroxacin is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial fluoroquinolone. It strongly inhibits the DNA-supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase. Fleroxacin is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2.Fleroxacin is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial fluoroquinolone. It strongly inhibits the DNA-supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase.The inhibition of DNA gyrase and DNA topoisomerase 2 leads ultimately to cell death as these enzymes are required for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, strand supercoiling repair, and recombination."
1017,"For the treatment of bacterial infections in animals.Apramycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic and has a bactericidal action against many gram-negative bacteria. Apramycin is a structurally unique antibiotic that contains a bicyclic sugar moiety and a monosubstituted deoxystreptamine. It is not approved for use in humans.Apramycin stands out among aminoglycosides for its mechanism of action which is based on blocking translocation and its ability to bind also to the eukaryotic decoding site despite differences in key residues required for apramycin recognition by the bacterial target. The drug binds in the deep groove of the RNA which forms a continuously stacked helix comprising non-canonical C.A and G.A base pairs and a bulged-out adenine. The binding mode of apramycin at the human decoding-site RNA is distinct from aminoglycoside recognition of the bacterial target, suggesting a molecular basis for the actions of apramycin in eukaryotes and bacteria."
1018,"A component of phosphatidylcholines (lecithins), in which the two hydroxy groups of glycerol are esterified with fatty acids. (From Stedman, 26th ed) It counteracts the effects of urea on enzymes and other macromolecules."
1019,"Iodipamide is used as a contrast agent for cholecystography and intravenous cholangiography.Iodipamide is a water-soluble radiographic contrast media for cholecystography and intravenous cholangiography.Following intravenous administration of Cholografin Meglumine, iodipamide is carried to the liver where it is rapidly secreted. The contrast medium appears in the bile within 10 to 15 minutes after injection, thus permitting visualization of the hepatic and common bile ducts, even in cholecystectomized patients. The gallbladder begins to fill within an hour after injection; maximum filling is reached after two to two and one-half hours. The contrast medium is finally eliminated in the feces without passing through the enterohepatic circulation, except for approximately 10 percent of the intravenously administered dose which is excreted through the kidneys.Organic iodine compounds block x-rays as they pass through the body, thereby allowing body structures containing iodine to be delineated in contrast to those structures that do not contain iodine. The degree of opacity produced by these iodinated organic compounds is directly proportional to the total amount (concentration and volume) of the iodinated contrast agent in the path of the x-rays."
1020,"For the treatment of acute pain, the symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis and primary dysmenorrhoea in adolescents and adults above 12 years old.Nimesulide is a relatively COX-2 selective, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with analgesic and antipyretic properties. Its approved indications are the treatment of acute pain, the symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis and primary dysmenorrhoea in adolescents and adults above 12 years old. Due to concerns about the risk of hepatotoxicity, nimesulide has been withdrawn from market in many countries.Food, gender and advanced age have negligible effects on nimesulide pharmacokinetics.The therapeutic effects of Nimesulide are the result of its complete mode of action which targets a number of key mediators of the inflammatory process such as: COX-2 mediated prostaglandins, free radicals, proteolytic enzymes and histamine."
1021,"The use of benoxaprofen, formerly marketed as Oraflex tablets, was associated with fatal cholestatic jaundice among other serious adverse reactions. The holder of the approved application voluntarily withdrew Oraflex tablets from the market on August 5, 1982."
1022,"Withdrawn from the Canadian, US, and UK markets in 1998 due to genotoxicity."
1023,For the treatment of depression (originally intended to treat tuberculosis).Withdrawn from the Canadian market in July 1964 due to interactions with food products containing tyrosine.Iproniazid is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) that was developed as the first anti-depressant.
1024,Used for over a century as a laxative.Phenolphthalein was withdrawn in Canada due to concerns with carcinogenicity in 1997.
1025,"Buformin is an anti-diabetic drug of the biguanide class, chemically related to metformin and phenformin. It was withdrawn from the market in most countries due to a high risk of causing lactic acidosis."
1026,"For the treatment of hypertension.Tienilic acid, or ticrynafen, is a diuretic drug with uric acid-lowering action which was marketed for the treatment of hypertension. It was withdrawn in 1982 after case reports in the United States suggested a link between ticrynafen and hepatitis. (Manier et al., 1982)"
1027,"For the treatment of insomnia, and as a sedative and muscle relaxant.Methaqualone is a sedative-hypnotic drug . The sedative-hypnotic activity was first noted by Indian researchers in the 1950s and in 1962 methaqualone itself was patented in the US by Wallace and Tiernan. Its use peaked in the early 1970s as a hypnotic, sedative, and muscle relaxant commonly used for insomnia. It has also been used illegally as a recreational drug, commonly known as Quaaludes, Sopors, Ludes or Mandrax (particularly in the 1970s in North America) depending on the manufacturer. Since at least 2001, it has been widely used in South Africa, where it is commonly referred to as ""smarties"" or ""geluk-tablette"" (meaning happy tablets)."
1028,"For the treatment of depression.The Food and Drug Administration suspended the marketing authorisation for Survector in 1999 and France withdrew it from the market, however several developing countries continued to produce it up until 2005.Amineptine is an atypical tricyclic antidepressant.Amineptine selectively inhibits the reuptake of dopamine and to a lesser extent norepinephrine, thus exerting a powerful and fast-acting antidepressant effect."
1029,"Used in the prophylaxis of migraine, occlusive peripheral vascular disease, vertigo of central and peripheral origin, and as an adjuvant in the therapy of epilepsy.Flunarizine is a selective calcium entry blocker with calmodulin binding properties and histamine H1 blocking activity. It is effective in the prophylaxis of migraine, occlusive peripheral vascular disease, vertigo of central and peripheral origin, and as an adjuvant in the therapy of epilepsy.Flunarizine is a selective calcium entry blocker with calmodulin binding properties and histamine H1 blocking activity.Flunarizine inhibits the influx of extracellular calcium through myocardial and vascular membrane pores by physically plugging the channel. The decrease in intracellular calcium inhibits the contractile processes of smooth muscle cells, causing dilation of the coronary and systemic arteries, increased oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue, decreased total peripheral resistance, decreased systemic blood pressure, and decreased afterload."
1030,"Used for the treatment of schizophrenia.A long-acting injectable antipsychotic agent used for chronic schizophrenia.Fluspirilene is a relatively long-acting injectable depot antipsychotic drug used for schizophrenia. Fluspirilene does not differ greatly from other depot antipsychotics (fluphenazine decanoate, fluphenazine enathate, perphenazine onanthat, pipotiazine undecylenate) with respect to treatment efficacy, response or tolerability. Outcomes suggest that fluspirilene does not differ significantly from oral antipsychotics or in different weekly regimens, although much cannot be inferred because of the shortage of trials."
1031,"It is a monoamine depletor and used as symptomatic treatment of chorea associated with Huntington's disease. FDA approved on August 15, 2008.Prolongation of the QTc interval has been observed at doses of 50 mg. In rats, it has been observed that tetrabenazine or its metabolites bind to melanin-containing tissues such as the eyes and skin. After a single oral dose of radiolabeled tetrabenazine, radioactivity was still detected in eye and fur at 21 days post dosing. Tetrabenazine is a reversible human vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 inhibitor (Ki = 100 nM)."
1032,"Investigated for use/treatment in breast cancer, head and neck cancer, melanoma, lung cancer, lymphoma (non-hodgkin's), prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and cancer/tumors (unspecified).Ixabepilone is an epothilone B analog developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb as a cancer drug. Ixabepilone is administered through injection, and will be marketed under the trade name Ixempra. It has a lactone–lactam modification that minimizes susceptibility to esterase degradation.Binding of Ixabepilone to beta-tubulins (e.g. beta-III tubulin) stabilizes microtubules. Microtubules are essential to cell division, and epothilones therefore stop cells from properly dividing. Like taxol, Ixabepilone binds to the αβ-tubulin heterodimer subunit."
1033,"This study demonstrated decreased incidence of arterial rupture or dissection (a specific type of arterial rupture in which the layers of the vessel separate prior to complete failure of the artery wall). Celiprolol is not approved for use by the FDA in the treatment of vascular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome.Celiprolol is a vasoactive beta-1 selective adrenoceptor antagonist with partial beta-2 agonist activity. The beta-2 agonist activity is thought to account for its mild vasodilating properties. It lowers blood pressure in hypertensive patients at rest and on exercise. Under conditions of stress such as exercise, celiprolol attenuates chronotropic and inotropic responses to sympathetic stimulation."
1034,"Roxadustat is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with symptomatic anemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD).Roxadustat is a first-in-class hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor used to treat anemia associated with chronic kidney disease. It works by reducing the breakdown of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), which is a transcription factor that stimulates red blood cell production in response to low oxygen levels. Roxadustat was first approved by the European Commission in August 2021.Roxadustat dose-dependently improves iron bioavailability, increases hemoglobin production, and increases red blood cell mass in patients with anemia. Roxadustat is a reversible and potent inhibitor of HIF-PHD enzymes: inhibition of HIF-PHD leads to the accumulation of functional HIF, an increase in plasma endogenous EPO production, enhanced erythropoiesis, and indirect suppression of hepcidin, which is an iron regulator protein that is increased during inflammation in chronic kidney disease. Roxadustat can also regulate iron transporter proteins  and regulates iron metabolism by increasing serum transferrin, intestinal iron absorption and the release of stored iron in patients with anemia associated with dialysis-dependent or dialysis-independent CKD."
1035,"Febuxostat is indicated for the chronic management of hyperuricemia in adult patients with gout who have an inadequate response to a maximally titrated dose of , who are intolerant to allopurinol, or for whom treatment with allopurinol is not advisable. Febuxostat works by inhibiting the activity of an enzyme that is responsible for the synthesis of uric acid, thereby reducing serum uric acid levels. Xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) can act as a xanthine oxidase or xanthine dehydrogenase. In humans, it is a critical enzyme for uric acid production as it catalyzes the oxidation reaction steps from hypoxanthine to xanthine and from xanthine to uric acid in the pathway of purine metabolism. As febuxostat can inhibit both forms of XOR, it can inhibit ROS formation, oxidative stress, and inflammation."
1036,"Dronedarone is indicated for the management of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients in sinus rhythm with a history of paroxysmal or persistent AF to reduce the risk of hospitalization.Dronedarone is a Class III antiarrhythmic drug that works to restore the normal sinus rhythm in patients with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation. A safety concern for the risk of drug-induced hepatocellular injury has been issued following marketing of dronedarone.Dronedarone is an antiarrhythmic agent that restores normal sinus rhythm and reduces heart rate in atrial fibrillation. The treatment of dronedarone in patients with severe heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction was associated with increased early mortality related to the worsening of heart failure. Compared to its related compound , dronedarone has a faster onset and offset of actions with a shorter elimination half-life and low tissue accumulation.Atrial fibrillation is the most common type of arrhythmia that is caused by abnormal electrical activity in the atria. Dronedarone achieves heart rate and rhythm control in atrial fibrillation."
1037,"Nebivolol and other beta blockers are generally not first line therapies as many patients are first treated with thiazide diuretics. Nebivolol was granted FDA approval on 17 December 2007.Nebivolol is a selective beta-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist that decreases vascular resistance, increases stroke volume and cardiac output, and does not negatively affect left ventricular function. Diabetic patients should monitor their blood glucose levels as beta blockers may mask signs of hypoglycemia.Nebivolol is a highly selective beta-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist with weak beta-2 adrenergic receptor antagonist activity. Nebivolol also inhibits aldosterone, and beta-1 antagonism in the juxtaglomerular apparatus also inhibits the release of renin. Decreased aldosterone leads to decreased blood volume, and decreased renin leads to reduced vasoconstriction."
1038,"Used in patients who are intolerant and/or resistant to two or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors used to treat accelerated or chronic phase CML.Omacetaxine mepesuccinate (formerly known as HHT or Homoharringtonine), is a cephalotaxine ester and protein synthesis inhibitor with established clinical activity as a single agent in hematological malignancies. In October 2005, omacetaxine mepesuccinate received Orphan Drug designation from the EMEA for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In November 2006, omacetaxine mepesuccinate, for the treatment of CML, was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA. Most recently, in October 2012, omacetaxine mepesuccinate was marketed under the brand name Synribo and FDA approved for patients who are intolerant and/or resistant to two or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors used to treat accelerated or chronic phase CML.The pharmacodynamics of homoharringtonine is not fully understood. Homoharringtonine inhibits protein synthesis by not directly binding to Bcr-Abl."
1039,"For the potential treatment of various leukemias, including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).Nilotinib, also known as AMN107, is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor under investigation as a possible treatment for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). A Phase I clinical trial in 2006 showed that this drug was relatively safe and offered significant therapeutic benefits in cases of CML which were found to be resistant to treatment with imatinib (Gleevec), another tyrosine kinase inhibitor used as a first-line treatment for CML.Nilotinib is a transduction inhibitor that targets BCR-ABL, c-kit and PDGF, for the potential treatment of various leukemias, including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).Chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) is caused by the BCR-ABL oncogene. Nilotinib inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the BCR-ABL protein. Nilotinib fits into the ATP-binding site of the BCR-ABL protein with higher affinity than imatinib, over-riding resistance caused by mutations. The ability of AMN107 to inhibit TEL-platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta (TEL-PDGFRbeta), which causes chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia, and FIP1-like-1-PDGFRalpha, which causes hypereosinophilic syndrome, suggests potential use of AMN107 for myeloproliferative diseases characterised by these kinase fusions (Stover et al, 2005; Weisberg et al, 2005)."
1040,"It is specifically used for lowering post-prandial blood glucose levels thereby reducing the risk of macrovascular complications.Voglibose is an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor used for lowering post-prandial blood glucose levels in people with diabetes mellitus. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors are oral anti-diabetic drugs used for diabetes mellitus type 2 that work by preventing the digestion of complex carbohydrates (such as starch). Complex carbohydrates are normally converted into simple sugars (monosaccharides) which can be absorbed through the intestine. The membrane-bound intestinal alpha-glucosidases hydrolyze oligosaccharides, trisaccharides, and disaccharides to glucose and other monosaccharides in the small intestine. Less glucose is absorbed because the carbohydrates are not broken down into glucose molecules."
1041,"It is used in patients with congestive heart failure. Trials were halted in the U.S., but the drug is used in various countries.Enoximone is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (type III) that increases the force of contraction of the heart and dilates blood vessels. In June 2005, Myogen announced that they were discontinuing development of enoximone due to negative results. The drug is approved for use in the UK.Further research is required to determine accurately the mechanism of action of drugs with phosphodiesterase inhibitory activity, however, inhibition of PDE3 inhibits degredation of cGMP. This allows for increased NO release and vascular relaxation."
1042,"For the treatment of premature ejaculation.Dapoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, for the treatment of premature ejaculation. In a phase II proof-of-concept study conducted by PPD, dapoxetine demonstrated a statistically significant increase in ejaculatory latency when compared to placebo. Alza submitted a NDA to the FDA for dapoxetine for the treatment of premature ejaculation in December 2004. Dapoxetine is a short-acting SSRI drug currently being considered for approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of premature ejaculation in men, which would make it the first drug approved for such treatment. Despite two clinical trials finished in 2006, experts doubt it will be approved by the FDA soon because SSRIs come with undesirable side-effects after long-term use, such as psychiatric problems, dermatological reactions, increase in body weight, lower sex-drive, nausea, headache, upset stomach and weakness, thus not significantly outweighing the benefit of premature ejaculation medication versus the risks."
1043,"For the treatment of symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome.Cilansetron is a 5HT-3 antagonist made by Solvay Pharmaceuticals that is currently under trial phase in the EU and US.Cilansetron is an orally formulated medication that blocks the action of 5-hydroxy-tryptamine 3 (5-HT3) receptors. Phase III studies of cilansetron had been suspended by Solvay in order to assess whether the drug possesses safety concerns similar to alosetron. Alosetron, also a 5-HT3 antagonist, was withdrawn from the market due to questions regarding its safety. Phase III testing with cilansetron has since resumed. In June 2005 the company announced that they were reviewing the priority of the cilansetron program.Cilansetron is a potent and selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist."
1044,"For the treatment of HIV-1 infection.Brecanavir (VX-385) an orally active aspartic protease inhibitor (PI), under investigation by Vertex and GlaxoSmithKline for the treatment of HIV. In July 2006, Vertex indicated that it expected GSK to initiate phase III trials of the drug in 2007. In December of 2006 GSK announced a decision to discontinue the development of brecanavir for the treatment of HIV. The decision was based on issues regarding the formulation of the drug.Test-tube data suggest that it has activity against virus with resistance to the currently available protease inhibitors, and that it is more powerful against wild-type HIV that existing protease inhibitors, being active at concentrations much lower than most existing protease inhibitors. Unlike some other protease inhibitors, brecanavir does not have a significant interaction with the nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NtRTI) tenofovir (Viread)."
1045,"For the symptomatic treatment of itchy eyes (caused by IgE-induced mast cell degranulation) due to allergic conjunctivitis.Bepotastine is a non-sedating, selective antagonist of the histamine 1 (H1) receptor. Bepotastine was approved in Japan for use in the treatment of allergic rhinitis and uriticaria/puritus in July 2000 and January 2002, respectively, and is marketed by Tanabe Seiyaku Co., Ltd. under the brand name Talion. The opthalmic solution is FDA approved since Sept 8, 2009 and is under the brand name Bepreve.Bepotastine is a non-sedating, selective antagonist of the histamine 1 (H1) receptor. Bepotastine works to relieve itchy eyes by three primary mechanisms of action. It is a non-sedating, selective antagonist of the histamine 1 (H1) receptor, a mast cell stabilizer, and it suppresses the migration of eosinophils into inflamed tissues to prevent tissue damage and worsening of allergic inflammation of the conjunctiva."
1046,"For the treatment of esophageal variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhotic liver disease and has also shown efficacy in the treatment of patients with AIDS-related diarrhea.Vapreotide is a synthetic octapeptide somatostatin analog. It was being studied for the treatment of cancer.Vapreotide is a somatostatin analog with a higher metabolic stability than the parent hormone. Vapreotide reduces splanchnic blood flow; inhibits growth hormone release, and inhibits the release of peptides and vasoactive compounds from neuroendocrine tumors.The exact mechanism of action is unknown, although one study has provided in vitro and in vivo evidence for a tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonist effect in the analgesic effects of vapreotide (PMID: 7556407)."
1047,"Nevertheless, it is important to note that the regulatory approval of and/or indications listed here for milnacipran may or may not exist and/or vary greatly between regions and nations .Milnacipran is a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) and like many agents in this category was originally developed for and continues to be approved and indicated for the treatment of depression . Levomilnacipran has no significant affinity for Ca++, K+, Na+, and Cl– channels and does not inhibit the activity of human monoamine oxidases (MAO-A and MAO-B) or acetylcholinesterase . Alternatively, a supratherapeutic dose of 300 mg/day is capable of causing a maximum mean difference in heart rate from placebo of 22.1 bpm and a mean difference in systolic and diastolic blood pressure from placebo ranging from 5.4 to 7.9 mmHg and 7.9 to 10.6 mmHg, respectively .The dual ability for milnacipran to inhibit the reuptake of both serotonin (5HT) and norepinephrine (NE) facilitates its treatment of both fibromyalgia and major depressive disorder (MDD). In particular, it is generally believed that 5HT and NE participate in the modulation of endogenous analgesic mechanisms by way of the descending inhibitory pain pathways in the brain and spinal cord . Such NE pain mitigation is consequently also enhanced by milnacipran's ability to enhance the presence of NE by inhibiting its reuptake via norepinephrine transporters at synaptic clefts ."
1048,"Flibanserin is the first drug to be approved for hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in premenopausal women by the FDA in August 2015. It was originally developed as an antidepressant medication by Boehringer Ingelheim, but showed lack of efficacy in trials and was further developed as a hypoactive sexual disorder drug by Sprout Pharmaceuticals. Flibanserin's mechanism of action is attributed to its high affinity for 5-HTA1 and 5-HTA2 receptors, displaying agonist activity on 5-HTA1 and antagonist on 5-HTA2, resulting in lowering of serotonin in the brain as well as an effect on increasing norepinephrine and dopamine neurotransmitters.Flibansetrin has high affinity for serotonin receptors in the brain: it acts as an agonist on 5-HT1A and an antagonist on 5-HT2A. In vivo, flibanserin binds equally to 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors. Its action on neurotransmitter receptors may contribute to reduction in serotonin levels and increase in dopamine and norepinephrine levels, all of which may play part in reward processing."
1049,"It was discovered by Basilea Pharmaceutica and is being developed by Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research and Development. Ceftobiprole is the first cephalosporin to demonstrate clinical efficacy in patients with infections due to methicillin-resistant staphylococci and, if approved by regulatory authorities, is expected to be a useful addition to the armamentarium of agents for the treatment of complicated skin infections and pneumonia.Ceftobiprole, a cephalosporin antibiotic, is active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.Cephalosporins, such as ceftobiprole, are bactericidal and have the same mode of action as other beta-lactam antibiotics (such as penicillins). Cephalosporins disrupt the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer of bacterial cell walls. The peptidoglycan layer is important for cell wall structural integrity, especially in Gram-positive organisms. The final transpeptidation step in the synthesis of the peptidoglycan is facilitated by transpeptidases known as penicillin binding proteins (PBPs)."
1050,"For the reduction of blood pressure when when oral antihypertensive therapy is not feasible or not desirable.Clevidipine is a dihydropyridine L-type calcium channel blocker that is selective for vascular smooth muscle and is indicated for blood pressure reduction when oral therapy is not an option.Clevidipine belongs to a well-known class of drugs called dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists. Clevidpine is the first third generation intravenous dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. In vitro studies demonstrated that clevidipine acts by selectively relaxing the smooth muscle cells that line small arteries, resulting in arterial dilation, widening of the artery opening, and without reducing central venous pressure or reducing cardiac output.Possibly by deforming the channel, inhibiting ion-control gating mechanisms, and/or interfering with the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, clevidipine inhibits the influx of extracellular calcium across both the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes. The resultant inhibition of the contractile processes of the myocardial smooth muscle cells leads to dilation of the coronary and systemic arteries and improved oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue."
1051,"Investigated for use/treatment in atherosclerosis, bacterial infection, and peripheral vascular disease.Rifalazil is a derivative of the antibiotic rifamycin. It is being investigated by ActivBiotics for the treatment of various bacterial infections.Rifalazil represents a new generation of ansamycins that contain a unique four-ring structure. Originally rifalazil was developed as a therapeutic agent to replace rifampin as part of a multiple drug regimen in the treatment of tuberculosis. As a result of its superior antimicrobial activity and high intracellular levels, rifalazil has potential to treat indications caused by the intracellular pathogen, Chlamydia trachomatis, which causes non-gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis, often leading to pelvic inflammatory disease. The potential value of rifalazil in the treatment of these indications will be assessed in human clinical trials.The potent antimycobacterial activity of rifalazil is due to inhibition of bacterial RNA polymerase."
1052,"Investigated for use/treatment in leukemia (unspecified).Tamibarotene is a novel synthetic retinoid for acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). Tamibarotene is currently approved in Japan for treatment of recurrent APL, and is undergoing clinical trials in the United States.Tamibarotene is a new synthetic retinoid drug recently approved for relapsed or refractory acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) in Japan. It is a specific agonist for retinoic acid receptor alpha/beta. Compared to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a natural retinoid indicated for a first-line treatment of APL, tamibarotene is chemically more stable and several times more potent as an inducer of differentiation in promyelocytic leukemia cells. In contrast to ATRA, whose plasma concentration declines considerably during daily administration, tamibarotene sustains plasma level probably due to a lower affinity for cellular retinoic acid binding protein."
1053,"Iloperidone is an atypical antipsychotic for the treatment of schizophrenia symptoms. Hoechst Marion Roussel Inc. researched the drug until May 1996. In June 1997 they gave the research rights to Titan Pharmaceuticals, who gave the worldwide development, manufacturing, and marketing rights to Novartis in August 1998. FDA approved on May 9, 2009.Iloperidone shows high affinity and maximal receptor occupancy for dopamine D2 receptors in the caudate nucleus and putamen of the brains of schizophrenic patients. Iloperidone also binds with high affinity to serotonin 5-HT2a and dopamine 3 receptors."
1054,"It is a neuronal potassium channel opener being developed as a first-in-class antiepileptic drug (AED) and is currently being studied in Phase 3 trials as an adjunctive treatment for partial-onset seizures in adult patients with refractory epilepsy. Ezogabine is highly efficacious in a broad-spectrum of in vivo epilepsy and seizure models. A comparison of antiepileptic form activity of ezogabine with that of conventional anticonvulsants in in vitro models suggests that retigabine is especially likely to be useful in the treatment of pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Thus, retigabine may prove to be useful in the treatment of a diverse range of disease states in which neuronal hyperexcitability is a common underlying factor.Ezogabine has a novel mechanism of action that involves opening of neuronal Kv7.2-7.5 (formerly KCNQ2-5) voltage activated potassium channels. In addition to acting on potassium ion channels, retigabine also affects GABA neurotransmission in the GABA-A receptor, which is a key inhibitory receptor in the central nervous system and is implicated in epilepsy."
1055,"Indacaterol is a novel, ultra-long-acting, rapid onset β(2)-adrenoceptor agonist developed for Novartis for the once-daily management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Indacaterol is also a chiral molecule but only the pure R-enantiomer is dispensed.Bronchodilator drugs are the foundation for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Otherwise, the drug's safety profile was similar to that of other bronchodilators. Indacaterol works by stimulating adrenergic beta-2 receptors in the smooth muscle of the airways. In vitro studies have shown that indacaterol has more than 24-fold greater agonist activity at beta2-receptors compared to beta1-receptors and 20-fold greater agonist activity compared to beta3-receptors."
1056,"In January 2005, the U.S. FDA granted a 'fast-track status' for investigation of ancrod use in patients suffering from acute ischemic stroke, a life threatening condition caused by the blockage of blood vessels supplying blood and oxygen to portions of the brain, for which phase III trials are currently being conducted.The decreased viscosity is directly attributable to lowered fibrinogen levels and leads to important improvements in blood flow and perfusion of the microcirculation. Ancrod decreases the blood viscosity in affected arteries, leads to less intense pain, improves physical limb mobility, facilitates physical and ergo therapy, and decreases the likelihood of local thrombotic events.Ancrod's anticoagulant effects are through the rapid removal of fibrinogen from the blood within hours following ancrod administration. These ancrod-induced microthrombi are friable, unstable, urea-soluble and have significantly degraded a-chains. They do not cross-link to form thrombi. Ancrod does not activate Factor XIII, produce platelet aggregation, or release ADP, ATP, potassium, or serotonin from platelets."
1057,"Cobimetinib is indicated in combination with  for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation. It has been approved in Switzerland and the US, in combination with vemurafenib for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma.Cobimetinib is a reversible inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2. BRAF-inhibitor-resistant tumor cells are sensitive to MEK inhibition, therefore cobimetinib and vemurafenib will result in dual inhibition of BRAF and its downstream target, MEK.Cobimetinib is a reversible inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2. In mice implanted with tumor cell lines expressing BRAF V600E, cobimetinib inhibited tumor cell growth. Cobimetinib and vemurafenib target two different kinases in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway."
1058,"Indicated as an adjunct for the prevention and treatment of wound sepsis in patients with second- and third-degree burns.Silver sulfadiazine is a sulfa derivative topical antibacterial used primarily on second- and third-degree burns.Silver sulfadiazine has broad antimicrobial activity. Silver sulfadiazine is not a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and may be useful in situations where such agents are contraindicated.Studies utilizing radioactive micronized silver sulfadiazine, electron microscopy, and biochemical techniques have revealed that the mechanism of action of silver sulfadiazine on bacteria differs from silver nitrate and sodium sulfadiazine. A specific mechanism of action has not been determined, but silver sulfadiazine's effectiveness may possibly be from a synergistic interaction, or the action of each component. Silver ions bind to nucleophilic amino acids, as well as sulfhydryl, amino, imidazole, phosphate, and carboxyl groups in proteins, causing protein denaturation and enzyme inhibition. Silver binds to surface membranes and proteins, causing proton leaks in the membrane, leading to cell death."
1059,"For the control of absence (petit mal) seizures that are refractory to other drugs.Mesuximide (or methsuximide) is an anticonvulsant medication. It is sold by Pfizer under the name Petinutin.Used in the treatment of epilepsy. Methsuximide suppresses the paroxysmal three cycle per second spike and wave activity associated with lapses of consciousness which is common in absence (petit mal) seizures. The frequency of epileptiform attacks is reduced, apparently by depression of the motor cortex and elevation of the threshold of the central nervous system to convulsive stimuli.Binds to T-type voltage sensitive calcium channels. Voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) mediate the entry of calcium ions into excitable cells and are also involved in a variety of calcium-dependent processes, including muscle contraction, hormone or neurotransmitter release, gene expression, cell motility, cell division and cell death."
1060,"Intended for the treatment of congestive heart failure and hyperuricemia.Oxypurinol, an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, is a metabolite of allopurinol.Oxypurinol inhibits the enzyme xanthine oxidase, blocking the conversion of the oxypurines hypoxanthine and xanthine to uric acid. Elevated concentrations of oxypurine and oxypurine inhibition of xanthine oxidase through negative feedback results in a decrease in the concentrations of uric acid in the blood and urine. Oxypurinol also facilitates the incorporation of hypoxanthine and xanthine into DNA and RNA, resulting in further reductions of serum uric acid concentrations."
1061,"Ecabet represents a new class of molecules that increases the quantity and quality of mucin produced by conjunctival goblet cells and corneal epithelia. Mucin is a glycoprotein component of tear film that lubricates while retarding moisture loss from tear evaporation. Ecabet is currently marketed in Japan as an oral agent for treatment of gastric ulcers and gastritis.Ecabet reduces the survival of H. pylori in the stomach and inhibits pepsin activity in the gastric juice of experimental animals. Here we have investigated the effects of ecabet on some of the factors involved in the dynamics of the mucosal barrier, i.e. pepsins and mucins. Inhibition of these enzymes prevents bacterial adhesion to gastric mucosa."
1062,"For use/treatment in neurologic disorders and parkinson's disease as well as moderate-to-severe primary Restless Legs Syndrome.Rotigotine (Neupro) is a non-ergoline dopamine agonist indicated for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) and restless legs syndrome (RLS) in Europe and the United States. Rotigotine was developed by Aderis Pharmaceuticals. Rotigotine has been authorized as a treatment for RLS since August 2008.Rotigotine is an agonist at all 5 dopamine receptor subtypes (D1-D5) but binds to the D3 receptor with the highest affinity. It is also an antagonist at α-2-adrenergic receptors and an agonist at the 5HT1A receptors. The effects of Neupro at doses up to 24 mg/24 hours (supratherapeutic doses) on the QT/QTc interval was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo- and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg IV, single dose) parallel-group trial with an overall treatment period of 52 days in male and female patients with advanced-stage Parkinson's disease."
1063,"Vandetanib is currently approved as an alternative to local therapies for both unresectable and disseminated disease. Because Vandetanib can prolong the Q-T interval, it is contraindicated for use in patients with serious cardiac complications such as congenital long QT syndrome and uncompensated heart failure. Vandetanib is an oral once-daily kinase inhibitor of tumour angiogenesis and tumour cell proliferation with the potential for use in a broad range of tumour types. On April 6 2011, vandetanib was approved by the FDA to treat nonresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic medullary thyroid cancer in adult patients.Mean IC50 of approximately 2.1 μg/mL.ZD-6474 is a potent and selective inhibitor of VEGFR (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor), EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) and RET (REarranged during Transfection) tyrosine kinases.

1067,"Ramucirumab is indicated for the treatment of advanced or metastatic gastric or gastro-esophageal junction adenocarcinoma. Patients who have EGFR or ALK genomic aberrations should also have disease progression following FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations.Lastly, ramucirumab is indicated for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with an alpha-fetoprotein level ≥400 ng/mL and have previously been treated with .Ramucirumab is a human monoclonal antibody (IgG1) against vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), a type II trans-membrane tyrosine kinase receptor expressed on endothelial cells. By binding to VEGFR2, ramucirumab prevents binding of its ligands (VEGF-A, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D), thereby preventing VEGF-stimulated receptor phosphorylation and downstream ligand-induced proliferation, permeability, and migration of human endothelial cells. VEGFR stimulation also mediates downstream signalling required for angiogenesis and is postulated to be heavily involved in cancer progression, making it a highly likely drug target. In contrast to other agents directed against VEGFR-2, ramucirumab binds a specific epitope on the extracellular domain of VEGFR-2, thereby blocking all VEGF ligands from binding to it."
1068,"Apremilast is indicated for the treatment of adults with active psoriatic arthritis and adults with oral ulcers associated with Behcet's Disease. In July 2019, apremilast was granted a new FDA approval for the treatment of oral ulcers associated with Behcet's disease, an autoimmune condition that causes recurrent skin, blood vessel, and central nervous system inflammation.Apremilast reduces but does not completely inhibit various inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1α, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 MCP-1, MIP-1β, MMP-3, and TNF-α, relieving the symptoms of psoriasis and Behcet's disease, which are caused by an increase in these inflammatory mediators. The need for apremilast should be carefully assessed along with the risk of worsening depression and suicide. If weight loss occurs, the degree of weight loss should be evaluated, and consideration should be made for the possible discontinuation of apremilast.The full mechanism of action of this drug is not fully established, however, it is known that apremilast is an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), which mediates the activity of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a second messenger. The above inflammatory mediators have been implicated in various psoriatic conditions as well as Behcet's disease, leading to their undesirable inflammatory symptoms such as mouth ulcers, skin lesions, and arthritis."
1069,"In adult patients, it is also indicated for the management of active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) alone or in combination with methotrexate, moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease (CD) and moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis.Ustekinumab is a human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 kappa monoclonal antibody directed against interleukin(IL)-12 and IL-23, which are cytokines that are involved in immune and inflammatory responses. It was generated via recombinant human IL-12 immunization of human Ig (hu-Ig) transgenic mice. It is a targeted biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (bDMARDs) that is used in the management of various inflammatory conditions that involve the activation of IL-12 and IL-23 signalling pathways.In September 2016, ustekinumab was additionally approved for the management of moderate to severe Crohn's disease in selected adult patients. It acts by reducing the signaling pathways of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-12 and IL-23, which play a role in various inflammatory conditions. They modulate lymphocyte function, including T-helper (Th) 1 and Th17 cell subsets, as CD4+ T cells can differentiate into T-helper (Th) effector lineages based on the environment."
1070,"Trastuzumab emtansine is marketed under the brand name Kadcyla and is indicated for use in HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer patients who have already used taxane and/or trastuzumab for metastatic disease or had their cancer recur within 6 months of adjuvant treatment. In the Herceptin-responsive models, Trastuzumab-DM1 caused complete tumor regression in all mice, whereas Herceptin alone slowed tumor growth. Thus the physiological effects of trastuzumab emtansine are cell cycle arrest and cell death by apoptosis. The drug portion is DM1, which is a maytansine derivative that inhibits microtubules. Together MCC and DM1 are called emtansine and are produced by chemical synthesis."
1071,"In Canada, it is used in patients who have received prior chemotherapy containing  after the failure of androgen deprivation therapy. In Canada, this combination product is also used with  and is reserved for patients who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, and in whom chemotherapy is not clinically indicated.Abiraterone is a potent, irreversible, and selective inhibitor of 17 αhydroxylase/C17,20-lyase (CYP17), an enzyme expressed in testicular, adrenal, and prostatic tumour tissues, to regulate androgen biosynthesis. As abiraterone has poor oral bioavailability and is susceptible to hydrolysis by esterases, abiraterone acetate was developed as an orally bioavailable prodrug with enhanced stability and absorption._In vivo_, abiraterone acetate is rapidly hydrolyzed to abiraterone, which mediates its pharmacological actions. Abiraterone decreases serum testosterone and other androgens. Androgen deprivation therapies, such as treatment with GnRH agonists or orchiectomy, decrease androgen production in the testes but do not affect androgen production by the adrenals or in the tumour."
1072,"Obeticholic acid is indicated for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA. Obeticholic acid is currently being considered for FDA approval to treat fibrosis caused by non-alcoholic liver steatohepatitis (NASH), and is likely to be approved for this indication in 2020.Primary biliary cirrhosis, or PBC, is a progressive and chronic condition that leads to hepatic injury often resulting in end-stage liver failure that requires liver transplantation. Obeticholic acid is a farnesoid-X receptor (FXR) agonist used to treat this condition, possibly allowing for increased survival. In 2016, it was granted approval to treat primary biliary cholangitis in combination with , which was previously the mainstay treatment for this condition. Primary biliary cirrhosis is an autoimmune process by which the bile ducts and liver are damaged progressively, leading to fibrosis and cirrhosis."
1073,"Investigated for use/treatment in solid tumors.Aldoxorubicin, an antineoplastic agents, is an albumin-binding prodrug of doxorubicin.INNO-206 is the (6-Maleimidocaproyl) hydrazone of doxorubicin. INNO-206 is a prodrug of doxorubicin that binds endogenous albumin after administration. The bound doxorubicin is released in the acidic environment of the tumor cell through cleavage of an acid sensitive linker. In preclinical models, INNO-206 was superior to doxorubicin with regard to antitumor efficacy and toxicity."
1074,"It is also indicated to monotherapy for acute management of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (**bipolar mania**) in adults, and acute management of depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (**bipolar depression**) in adults.Cariprazine is an atypical antipsychotic agent and a piperazine derivative that was first developed in Hungary. In clinical trials, it reduced positive and negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and acute mania in patients with bipolar I disorder. While recent research points to the involvement of multiple neurotransmitters in the development and maintenance of schizophrenia and bipolar disorders, the dopamine hypothesis has been and continues to be a key theory in understanding the pathophysiology of these psychiatric disorders. For example, hyperactive dopamine D2 receptor activity has been associated with positive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hallucinations and delusions. It was stated that hyperdopaminergia, caused by elevations in D2/3 receptor availability and a hyperactive reward processing network, underlies the development of mania in bipolar disorder."
1075,"Olaratumab (IMC-3G3) is a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody with antitumor activity that selectively binds the external domain of human platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-α with high affinity and blocks ligand binding. Olaratumab antibody binding leads to inhibition of ligand-dependent signaling in PDGFR(alpha)-expressing tumor cells, as well as stromal cells in the tumor microenviroment that are dependent on PDGFR(alpha) signaling. Olaratumab blocks ligand-induced tumor cell proliferation, and inhibits receptor autophosphorylation and ligand-induced phosphorylation of the downstream signaling molecules protein kinase B (Akt) and mitogen-activated protein kinase . PDGFR signalling is a type of tyrosine kinase-mediated pathway that normally regulates cell growth, chemotaxis, and mesenchymal stem cell differentiation. It also promotes internalization of PDGFR thus alters the surface levels of PDGFR."

It is widely available in Russia as an over-the-counter drug manufactured by a number of Russian pharmaceutical companies."
1080,"Used for the treatment of angina pectoris .Pentaerythritol tetranitrate is the nitrate ester of pentaerythritol that possesses explosive properties. When mixed with a plasticizer, this chemical forms a plastic explosive. It is recognized by the FDA to be a coronary vasodilator in the treatment of heart conditions such as angina . It is formed by reacting pentaerythritol (C5H12O4), an alcohol commonly used in paints and varnishes, with nitric acid (HNO2). Nitrate enters vascular smooth muscle and converted to nitric oxide (NO) which acts as a cellular messenger, leading to activation of cyclic GMP and, therefore, vasodilation ."
1081,"For use in conjunction with diet and exercise for patients with a body mass index greater than 30 kg/m2, or patients wih a BMI greater than 27 kg/m2 with associated risk factors, such as type 2 diabetes or dyslipidaemia.Rimonabant is an anorectic anti-obesity drug produced and marketed by Sanofi-Aventis. It is an inverse agonist for the cannabinoid receptor CB1. Its main avenue of effect is reduction in appetite. Rimonabant is the first selective CB1 receptor blocker to be approved for use anywhere in the world. It is therefore reasonable to hypothesize that the attenuation of the activity of this system would have therapeutic benefit in treating disorders that might have a component of excess appetitive drive or over-activity of the endocannabinoid system, such as obesity, ethanol and other drug abuse, and a variety of central nervous system and other disorders."
1082,"In patients ≥4 years of age, canakinumab is indicated for the treatment of Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS), including Familial Cold Auto-inflammatory Syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS). Canakinumab is also indicated for the treatment of gout flares in adult patients in whom standard therapies (e.g. NSAIDs, colchicine) are contraindicated, not tolerated, or ineffective, and in whom repeated courses of corticosteroids are not appropriate.Canakinumab is a recombinant, human anti-human-IL-1β monoclonal antibody that belongs to the IgG1/κ isotype subclass. It is expressed in a murine Sp2/0-Ag14 cell line and comprised of two 447- (or 448-) residue heavy chains and two 214-residue light chains, with a molecular mass of 145157 Daltons when deglycosylated.

Canakinumab has promising clinical safety and pharmacokinetic properties, and demonstrated potential for the treatment of cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA), and possibly for other complex inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, COPD disease and ocular diseases."
1083,"Romidepsin is indicated for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) in adult patients who have received at least one prior systemic therapy.Romidepsin is a selective inhibitor of histone deacetylase, approved in the US in 2009 for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) in patients who have received at least one prior systemic therapy.Romidepsin is a prodrug, where it becomes active once taken up into the cell. The active metabolite has a free thiol group, which interacts with zinc ions in the active site of class 1 and 2 HDAC enzymes, resulting in inhibition of its enzymatic activity. Certain tumors have over expressed HDACs and downregulated/mutated histone acetyltransferases. This imbalance of HDAC relative to histone acetyltransferase can lead to a decrease in regulatory genes, ensuing tumorigenesis. Inhibition of HDAC may restore normal gene expression in cancer cells and result in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis."

1100,"It was also previously indicated for the treatment of female hirsutism and African trypanosomiasis but has since been discontinued.Eflornithine is an irreversible ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor originally developed as a treatment for human African trypanosomiasis. Further research has also implicated ornithine decarboxylase in other conditions like facial hirsutism and cancer, especially when ornithine decarboxylase is highly upregulated in tumor cells. Subsequently, on December 14, 2023, the FDA approved eflornithine again but under the brand name IWILFIN as an oral maintenance therapy to reduce the risk of relapse in adult and pediatric patients with high-risk neuroblastoma who have demonstrated at least a partial response to prior multiagent, multimodality therapy, including anti-GD2 immunotherapy. This approval is based on positive results obtained from a multi-site, single-arm, externally controlled study of children with high-risk neuroblastoma, where a 52% reduction in the risk of relapse and a 68% reduction in the risk of death were observed.Inhibition of polyamine synthesis by eflornithine restored the balance of the LIN28/Let-7 metabolic pathway, which is involved in the regulation of cancer stem cells and glycolytic metabolism, by decreasing expression of the oncogenic drivers MYCN and LIN28B in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma. In vitro, eflornithine induced senescence and suppressed neurosphere formation in MYCN-amplified and MYCN non-amplified neuroblastoma cells, indicating a cytostatic effect."

Also investigated for use/treatment in neurologic disorders, nephropathy, blood (blood forming organ disorders, unspecified), and dizzy/fainting spells.Droxidopa is a precursor of noradrenaline that is used in the treatment of Parkinsonism. There is a deficit of noradrenaline as well as of dopamine in Parkinson's disease and it has been proposed that this underlies the sudden transient freezing seen usually in advanced disease. Though L-DOPS has been used in Japan and Southeast Asia already for some time, it is also currently in clinical trials at the phase III point in the United States (U.S.), Canada, Australia, and throughout Europe. Provided L-DOPS successfully completes clinical trials, it could be approved for the treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (NOH) as early as 2011."
1102,"Investigated for use/treatment in neurologic disorders, spinal cord injuries, muscle spasm, back pain, and multiple sclerosis.Tolperisone is an oral, centrally acting muscle relaxant. Its precise mechanism is not completely understood, though it blocks sodium and calcium channels. It possesses a high affinity for nervous system tissue, reaching highest concentrations in brain stem, spinal cord and peripheral nerves. Based on existing clinical data, Tolperisone is not sedating and does not interact with alcohol."
1103,"Investigated for use/treatment in benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostate disorders, and cancer/tumors (unspecified).Lonidamine (LND) is a drug that interferes with energy metabolism of cancer cells, principally inhibiting aerobic glycolytic activity, by its effect on mitochondrially-bound hexokinase (HK). In such way LND could impair energy-requiring processes, as recovery from potentially lethal damage, induced by radiation treatment and by some cytotoxic drugs.Lonidamine is an orally administered small molecule that inhibits glycolysis by the inactivation of hexokinase. Hexokinase is an enzyme that catalyzes glucose, the first step in glycolysis. The inhibition of hexokinase by lonidamine is well established. In addition, there is evidence that lonidamine may increase programmed cell death."
1104,"Investigated for use/treatment in erectile dysfunction and hypertension.Udenafil is a new phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED). It has been approved in South Korea and will be marketed under the brand name Zydena. It is not yet approved for use in the U.S., E.U., or Canada.Udenafil is a potent selective phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor.Udenafil inhibits the cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum located around the penis. Penile erection during sexual stimulation is caused by increased penile blood flow resulting from the relaxation of penile arteries and corpus cavernosal smooth muscle. This response is mediated by the release of nitric oxide (NO) from nerve terminals and endothelial cells, which stimulates the synthesis of cGMP in smooth muscle cells."
1105,"Investigated for use/treatment in pulmonary hypertension, connective tissue diseases, hypertension, and congestive heart failure.Sitaxentan was marketed under the trade name Thelin for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) by Encysive Pharmaceuticals until Pfizer purchased Encysive in February 2008. In 2010, Pfizer voluntarily removed sitaxentan from the market over concerns of hepatotoxicity.Sitaxentan belongs to a class of drugs known as endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs). Patients with PAH have elevated levels of endothelin, a potent blood vessel constrictor, in their plasma and lung tissue. Sitaxentan blocks the binding of endothelin to its receptors, thereby negating endothelin's deleterious effects.Sitaxentan is a competitive antagonist of endothelin-1 at the endothelin-A (ET-A) and endothelin-B (ET-B) receptors. Under normal conditions, endothelin-1 binding of ET-A or ET-B receptors causes pulmonary vasoconstriction."
1106,"Sulodexide has been used clinically for the prophylaxis and treatment of vascular diseases with increased risk of thrombosis, including intermittent claudication, peripheral arterial occlusive disease and post-myocardial infarc-tion. New anti-inflammatory properties have also extended its use in venous disease.Sulodexide is a mixture of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) composed of dermatan sulfate (DS) and fast moving heparin (FMH).Sulodexide is extensively absorbed owing to its low molecular weight compared to unfractionated heparin. Research has also shown that Sulodexide had endothelial protective properties by inducing the overexpression of growth factors important for the protection of organs. The intravenous administration has also been shown capable of releasing tissue factor pathway inhibitor from the endothelium, which also contributes to the anti-thrombotic effects of Sulodexide. Lastly, this drug is known for its ability to inhibit the secretion of MMPs, particularly MMP-9, from leukocytes in a dose dependent manner, resulting in the restoration of the balance with their tissue inhibitors.Thrombin inhibition produced by sulodexide is due to the additive effect of its components, namely, heparin cofactor II (HCII) catalysis by dermatan sulfate  and antithrombin-III catalysis by fast moving heparin (FMH)."

1110,"Ziconotide is indicated for the management of severe chronic pain in patients refractory to other treatments, and for whom intrathecal therapy is warranted.Ziconotide (also known as SNX-111) is a neurotoxic peptide derived from the cone snail _Conus magus_ comprising 25 amino acids with three disulphide bonds. Ziconotide is used to manage severe chronic pain refractory to other methods, through its ability to inhibit N-type calcium channels involved in nociceptive signalling. To date, ziconotide is the only calcium channel blocking peptide approved for use by the FDA.Ziconotide inhibits N-type calcium channels involved in nociceptive signalling, primarily in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) are important regulatory components of neural signalling and include the N-type (Cav2.2) heteromultimeric high-voltage type calcium channels. In addition, SP and CGRP induce inflammation, potentially exacerbating pre-existing inflammatory chronic pain."
1111,"First approved in the United States in November 2002 and in Europe in April 2003, teriparatide makes the first approved drug in a new category of osteoporosis therapy called anabolic therapy. Teriparatide is used in the treatment of osteoporosis in men and women.Teriparatide is a PTH analog that works to stimulate bone formation in both men and women. It causes a transient increase in serum calcium levels and increases urinary calcium excretion. Continuous exposure to PTH promotes bone resorption, whereas intermittent exposure to low-dose PTH can induce bone formation more favourably than bone resorption. Binding of teriparatide to PTH receptors on osteoblasts activates the downstream PKA- and PKC-dependent signaling pathways that promotes anabolic effects on bone."
1112,"For the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). It was developed by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals under the trade name Torisel. Temsirolimus was approved by the FDA in late May 2007 as well as the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) on November 2007.Temsirolimus is an inhibitor of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). Temsirolimus binds to an intracellular protein (FKBP-12), and the protein-drug complex inhibits the activity of mTOR that controls cell division. In in vitro studies using renal cell carcinoma cell lines, temsirolimus inhibited the activity of mTOR and resulted in reduced levels of the hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1 and HIF-2 alpha, and the vascular endothelial growth factor."

1117,"FDA approved on July 31, 2009.Post-administration of saxagliptin, GLP-1 and GIP levels rise up to 2- to 3- fold. Because it is very selective of DPP-4 inhibition, there are fewer systemic side effects. Saxagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor antidiabetic for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Incretins decrease blood sugar by increasing consumption of sugar by the body, mainly through increasing insulin production in the pancreas, and by reducing production of sugar by the liver. The inhibition of DPP-4 increases levels active of glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which inhibits glucagon production from pancreatic alpha cells and increases production of insulin from pancreatic beta cells."
1118,"Pertuzumab is also indicated for subcutaneous injection - in combination with trastuzumab and  - in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancers in adults.Pertuzumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the extracellular dimerization domain (subdomain II) of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 protein (HER2). It consists of two heavy chains and two lights chains that have 448 and 214 residues respectively.Its indicated conditions have since expanded to include use as both a neoadjuvant therapy and an adjuvant therapy in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancers at high risk of recurrence.Pertuzumab exerts its antineoplastic effects by binding to and inhibiting the activity of HER2, an oncogene that has been implicated in the formation of numerous cancers. As with other therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, pertuzumab has a relatively long duration of action necessitating dosing every 3 weeks. Pertuzumab targets the extracellular dimerization domain (subdomain II) of HER2, thereby inhibiting ligand-initiated intracellular signaling via the MAP kinase and PI3K pathways. Inhibition of these pathways results in inhibition of cell growth and the initiation of apoptosis, respectively."
1119,"Rilonacept is indicated for the treatment of Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS), including Familial Cold Auto-inflammatory Syndrome (FCAS), and Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS) in patients aged 12 and older. Finally, rilonacept is indicated for the treatment of recurrent pericarditis (RP) and to reduce the risk of RP recurrence in patients aged 12 and older.Rilonacept is a dimeric fusion protein consisting of portions of IL-1R and the IL-1R accessory protein linked to the Fc portion of immunoglobulin G1. Rilonacept functions as an interleukin 1 inhibitor and is used in the treatment of CAPS, also known as cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes, including familial cold auto-inflammatory syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS), in adults and children greater than 12 years old.Treatment with Rilonacept resulted in decreased levels of mean C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and Serum Amyloid A (SAA). In most cases, inflammation in CAPS is associated with mutations in the NLRP-3 gene which encodes the protein cryopyrin, an important component of the inflammasome. Rilonacept blocks IL-1β signaling by acting as a soluble decoy receptor that binds IL-1β and prevents its interaction with cell surface receptors."
1120,"Indicated for following conditions alone or in combination with conjugated estrogens in women with a uterus:    - Treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause    - Prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosisBazedoxifene is a third generation selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), developed by Pfizer following the completion of their takeover of Wyeth Pharmaceuticals.

Bazedoxifene acts as both an oestrogen-receptor agonist and/or antagonist, depending upon the cell and tissue type and target genes."
1121,"Doxercalciferol is indicated for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis, as well as for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with Stage 3 or Stage 4 chronic kidney disease. Specifically, the biologically active vitamin D metabolites control the intestinal absorption of dietary calcium, the tubular reabsorption of calcium by the kidney and, in conjunction with parathyroid hormone (PTH), the mobilization of calcium from the skeleton. They act directly on bone cells (osteoblasts) to stimulate skeletal growth, and on the parathyroid glands to suppress PTH (parathyroid hormone) synthesis and secretion. These functions are mediated by the interaction of these biologically active metabolites with specific receptor proteins in the various target tissues. In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), deficient production of biologically active vitamin D metabolites (due to lack of or insufficient 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1-alpha-hydroxylase activity) leads to secondary hyperparathyroidism, which contributes to the development of metabolic bone disease."
1122,"Indicated in the treatment of anemias caused by deficient red cell production. Acquired aplastic anemia, congenital aplastic anemia, myelofibrosis and the hypoplastic anemias due to the administration of myelotoxic drugs often respond.

1124,"Etravirine is an antiretroviral agent more specifically classified as a Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NNRTI). Etraverine is used clinically for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. On January 18, 2007, the FDA granted accelerated approved for the use of etravirine 100mg tablets in the treatment of adult HIV-1 infection documented to be resistant to therapy with other NNRTIs and antiretroviral agents. Etravirine exerts its effects via direct inhibition of the reverse transcriptase enzyme of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and consequently blocks DNA-dependent and RNA-dependent polymerase activity. In 2013, reports of Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) in the setting of immune reconstitution, as well as more in depth information about the development of rashes in patients taking etravirine, lead to a modification of etravirine's monograph.Clinical trials have shown no prolongation of QT intervals on electrocardiograms after 8 days of dosing."
1125,"Cethromycin currently has no FDA-approved indications; it was granted orphan drug designation for the prophylactic treatment of inhalation anthrax in 2007 and for the prophylactic treatment of both plague due to Yersinia pestis and tularemia due to Francisella tularensis in 2009.Cethromycin is a 3-keto (ketolide) derivative of erythromycin A with an 11,12-carbamate group and an O-6-linked aromatic ring system. Cethromycin represents a joint development effort by Abbott Laboratories, Taisho Pharmaceuticals, and Advanced Life Sciences, intended to be marketed under the trade name Restanza for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. However, after completing phase III clinical trials, it was deemed safe but not sufficiently efficacious by the FDA. It has also been investigated, by itself or together with , for the treatment of gonorrhea, and was recently suggested as a possible treatment for liver-stage Plasmodium sporozoite infection.Cethromycin binds to the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome to inhibit both ribosome assembly and bacterial protein synthesis. Adverse effects such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and headache may be due to off-target inhibition of molecules within mammalian cells.Respiratory tract infections can be caused by numerous strains of bacteria, requiring careful consideration of treatment and antibiotics effective against a broad spectrum of potential pathogens."

1146,"Vilazodone is approved for treatment of major depressive disorder.Vilazodone is a novel compound with combined high affinity and selectivity for the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) transporter and 5-HT(1A) receptors. Vilazodone may also be associated with less sexual dysfunction and weight gain. Vilazodone was given FDA approval on January 21, 2011.Vilazodone increases serotonin levels in the brain by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin while acting as a partial agonist on serotonin-1A receptors. Due to this activity vilazodone has sometimes been referred to as a selective partial agonist and reuptake inhibitor (SPARI).Vilazodone selectively inhibits serotonin reuptake in the central nervous system as well as acting as a partial agonist of 5HT-1A receptors. The exact mechanism for how these effects translate to its antidepressant effects are not known, though there is an association between these effects and antidepressive activity."
1147,"For the treatment of patients with esophageal varices that have recently bled, to prevent rebleeding.Ethanolamine oleate is a mild sclerosing agent. It is composed of ethanolamine, a basic substance, which when combined with oleic acid forms a clear, straw to pale yellow colored, deliquescent oleate.When injected intravenously, ethanolamine oleate acts primarily by irritation of the intimal endothelium of the vein and produces a sterile dose-related inflammatory response. This results in fibrosis and possible occlusion of the vein. Ethanolamine oleate also rapidly diffuses through the venous wall and produces a dose-related extravascular inflammatory reaction.The oleic acid component of ethanolamine oleate is responsible for the inflammatory response, and may also activate coagulation in vivo by release of tissue factor and activation of Hageman factor. The ethanolamine component, however, may inhibit fibrin clot formation by chelating calcium, so that a procoagulant action of ethanolamine oleate has not been demonstrated."
1148,"Nitrous oxide, commonly known as ""laughing gas"", is a chemical compound with the chemical formula N2O. At room temperature, it is a colorless non-flammable gas, with a pleasant, slightly sweet odor and taste. It is used in surgery and dentistry for its anesthetic and analgesic effects. It is known as ""laughing gas"" due to the euphoric effects of inhaling it, a property that has led to its recreational use as an inhalant drug.Findings to date indicate that nitrous oxide induces opioid peptide release in the brain stem leading to the activation of descending noradrenergic neurones, which results in modulation of the nociceptive process in the spinal cord. Several receptor–effector mechanisms including dopamine receptors, α2 adrenoceptors, benzodiazepine receptors and -methyl- -aspartate (NMDA) receptors have been implicated although the relationship of one with the other is not known."
1149,"Indicated for the treatment of allergic conditions, symptomatic relief of hypersensitivity reaction, and treatment of pruritic skin disorders.Mepyramine, or pyrilamine, targets the H1 receptor. It is a first generation antihistamine. However, it rapidly permeates the brain and so often causes drowsiness as a side effect. It has been found in over-the-counter combination products for colds and menstrual symptoms, but is considered to be an unapproved prescription medication used for cough, cold, or allergic conditions.Mepyramine is a histamine H1 receptor inverse agonist. It binds to a G protein-coupled form of the receptor and promotes a G protein-coupled inactive state of the H1 receptor that interferes with the Gq/11-mediated signaling."
1150,"For prophylactic use to reduce perioperative blood loss and the need for blood transfusion in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass in the course of coronary artery bypass graft surgery who are at an increased risk for blood loss and blood transfusion.Aprotinin is a protein-based drug that is also known as bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI). For this use, it is typically administered by injection. The goal of using of aprotinin was subsequently to minimize end-organ damage resulting from hypotension due to blood loss in surgery and to reduce the necessity for blood transfusions during surgery. Aprotinin, through its inhibition of multiple mediators  results in the attenuation of inflammatory responses, fibrinolysis, and thrombin generation. Inhibition of plasmin also slows fibrinolysis."
1151,"Dabigatran etexilate pellets are indicated for the treatment of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) in pediatric patients between three months and 12 years of age who have been treated with a parenteral anticoagulant for at least 5 days. Lastly, it is indicated in pediatric patients between eight and 18 years of age for the treatment of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) in patients who have been treated with a parenteral anticoagulant for at least 5 days and to reduce the risk of recurrence of VTE in patients who have been previously treated.

1152,"Arbekacin is used for the short term treatment of multi-resistant bacterial infections, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).An semisynthetic aminoglycoside antibiotic. Often used for treatment of multi-resistant bacterial infection such as methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA).Arbekacin is an aminoglycoside. Aminoglycosides function by binding to bacterial 30S ribosomal subunits, causing t-RNA misreads, and preventing the production of proteins. Anaerobes are less susceptible to aminoglycosides because they do not spend as much energy as aerobes on taking up chemicals like aminoglycosides. Arbekacin binds to 4 nucleotides of the 16S subunit and 1 amino acid of protein S12 to interfere with the decoding site around nucleotide 1400 in the 16S subunit."
1153,"May also be used to treat uncomplicated malaria when the Plasmodium species has not been identified. Artemether is administered in combination with lumefantrine for improved efficacy. Artemether has a rapid onset of action and is rapidly cleared from the body. Lumefantrine has a much longer half life and is believed to clear residual parasites. The generally accepted mechanism of action of peroxide antimalarials involves interaction of the peroxide-containing drug with heme, a hemoglobin degradation byproduct, derived from proteolysis of hemoglobin."
1154,"Betahistine is indicated for the reduction of recurrent vertigo episodes associated with Ménière's disease in patients 18 years old and above.Ménière's disease is a progressive disease of the inner ear characterized by vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss. It is thought to reduce symptoms through its actions on histamine receptors. It is currently marketed in Canada by various companies, including Teva Pharmaceuticals.Through its actions on the histamine receptors, betahistine provides relief from vertigo associated with Ménière's disease. Ménière's disease is thought to result from a disruption of endolymphatic fluid homeostasis in the ear. **H3-receptor activity**    In addition to the above mechanisms, betahistine also acts as a histamine H3-receptor antagonist, increasing the turnover of histamine from postsynaptic histaminergic nerve receptors, subsequently leading to an increase in H1-agonist activity."
1155,"Desvenlafaxine is indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder in adults. It was approved by the FDA in 2008 for the treatment of adults with major depressive disorder (MDD). The major difference is the potential for drug interaction since venlafaxine is mainly metabolized by CYP2D6 while desvenlafaxine is conjugated by UGT; therefore, desvenlafaxine is less likely to cause drug-drug interaction when taken with medications affecting the CYP2D6 pathway.Desvenlafaxine is a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. No clinically relevant differences were observed between desvenlafaxine treated and placebo-treated patients for QT, QTc, PR, and QRS intervals. Particularly, desvenlafaxine has been found to inhibit the serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine transporters with varying degrees of affinity."
1156,"Fesoterodine is indicated for the treatment of overactive bladder in adult patients with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency. It is also indicated in the treatment of neurogenic detrusor overactivity in pediatric patients ≥6 years old weighing >25 kg.Fesoterodine is an antimuscarinic prodrug for the treatment of overactive bladder syndrome.In-vivo the fesoteridine prodrug is broken down into its active metabolite, 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), by plasma esterases. The 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite, which exhibits an antimuscarinic activity. Both urinary bladder contraction and salivation are mediated via cholinergic muscarinic receptors. Therefore, acting as a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist, fesoterodine ultimately acts to decrease the detrusor pressure by its muscarinic antagonism, thereby decreasing bladder contraction and consequently, the urge to urinate.Fesoterodine, once converted to its active metabolite, 5-hydroxymethyltolterodine, acts as a competitive antagonists at muscarinic receptors."
1157,"Used as a topical nasal decongestant and vasoconstrictor in dentistry.Levonordefrin acts as a topical nasal decongestant and vasoconstrictor, most often used in dentistry.Levonordefrin is a sympathomimetic amine used as a vasoconstrictor in local anesthetic solutions. It has pharmacologic activity similar to that of Epinephrine but it is more stable than Epinephrine. In equal concentrations, Levonordefrin is less potent than Epinephrine in raising blood pressure, and as a vasoconstrictor.It is designed to mimic the molecular shape of adrenaline. It binds to alpha-adrenergic receptors in the nasal mucosa. Here it can, therefore, cause vasoconstriction."
1158,"Methyltestosterone is an anabolic steroid hormone used to treat men with a testosterone deficiency. It is also used in women to treat breast cancer, breast pain, swelling due to pregnancy, and with the addition of estrogen it can treat symptoms of menopause.A synthetic anabolic steroid used for treating men with testosterone deficiency or similar androgen replacement therapies. Methyltestosterone is a schedule III drug in the US.Testosterone is a steroid hormone from the androgen group. On average, the adult male body produces about twenty times the amount of testosterone than an adult female's body does.The effects of testosterone in humans and other vertebrates occur by way of two main mechanisms: by activation of the androgen receptor (directly or as DHT), and by conversion to estradiol and activation of certain estrogen receptors. Free testosterone (T) is transported into the cytoplasm of target tissue cells, where it can bind to the androgen receptor, or can be reduced to 5&alpha;-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the cytoplasmic enzyme 5&alpha;-reductase."
1159,"It acts to decrease congestion and is found in many over the counter (OTC) eye drops and nasal preparations. Naphazoline was first developed in 1942 as a nasal formulation for congestion.Naphazoline is a sympathomimetic alpha adrenergic agonist that acts to vasoconstrict nasal or ocular arterioles, resulting in reduced congestion at the site of administration.Naphazoline is a vasoconstrictor that functions by stimulating alpha adrenergic receptors in arterioles leading to decreased congestion at the site of administration. Naphazoline causes the release of norepinephrine in sympathetic nerves. Norepinephrine binds to alpha adrenergic receptors and causes vasoconstriction. Naphazoline's release of norepinephrine also triggers a negative feedback loop which decreases production of norepinephrine, which can lead to rhinitis medicamentosa after long term use when naphazoline is stopped."
1160,"For the management of vasospastic angina, chronic stable angina and hypertension.Nilvadipine is a calcium channel blocker (CCB) for the treatment of hypertension.Nilvadipine is similar to other dihydropyridines including amlodipine, felodipine, isradipine, and nicardipine. Nilvadipine is used to treat Prinzmetal's angina, hypertension, and other vascular disorders such as Raynaud's phenomenon. By blocking the calcium channels, Nifedipine inhibits the spasm of the coronary artery and dilates the systemic arteries, results in a increase of myocardial oxygen supply and a decrease in systemic blood pressure.Nilvadipine inhibits the influx of extracellular calcium through myocardial and vascular membrane pores by physically plugging the channel. The decrease in intracellular calcium inhibits the contractile processes of smooth muscle cells, causing dilation of the coronary and systemic arteries, increased oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue, decreased total peripheral resistance, decreased systemic blood pressure, and decreased afterload."
1161,"Potassium Iodide is oral antithyroid agent used in the prevention of radioactive iodine uptake into the thyroid gland during a nuclear radiation emergency. Potassium Iodide may be used as an adjunct to other antithyroid agents in the treatment of hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis and preoperatively to induce thyroid involution.Saturated solution of Potassium Iodide (SSKI) is used pharmaceutically for emergency use in patients experiencing acute symptoms of severe hyperthyroidism (also known as thyroid storm or thyrotoxic crisis). SSKI can also be used for radioiodine-contamination emergencies or in preparation of thyrotoxic patients for thyroidectomy.It works in the thyroid gland. By inhibiting thyroid hormone synthesis and release, thyroid gland vascularity is reduced, thyroid gland tissue becomes firmer, thyroid cell size is reduced, follicular colloid reaccumulates, and bound iodine levels increase. As a protectant following radiation exposure, KI blocks the uptake of radioactive iodine isotopes by the thyroid gland thereby minimizing the risk of radiation-induced thyroid neoplasms."
1162,"For monitored anaesthesia care sedation in patients undergoing diagnostic procedures like bronchoscopy and colonscopy or minor surgical procedures like arthroscopy and bunionectomy. Fospropofol is a water soluble prodrug and is converted to propofol in the liver. FDA approved in December 2008. 1.86 mg of fospropofol is the molar equivalent for 1mg of propofol. By binding to GABA-A receptor, it will cause an increase in chloride conductance, thus inhibiting the firing of new action potentials in the post-synaptic neuron."
1163,"It aids in the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy treatment.Fosaprepitant is a prodrug of Aprepitant. Once biologically activated, the drug acts as a substance P/neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonist which, in combination with other antiemetic agents, is indicated for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy. Animal and human studies show that Aprepitant augments the antiemetic activity of the 5-HT3-receptor antagonist ondansetron and the corticosteroid  ethasone and inhibits both the acute and delayed phases of cisplatin induced emesis. In summary, the active form of fosaprepitant is as an NK1 antagonist which is because it blocks signals given off by NK1 receptors. This therefore decreases the likelihood of vomiting in patients experiencing."
1164,"C1-inhibitor is a protease that inhibits the complement system (part of the innate immune system), a biochemical chain of reactions which assists the body in removing pathogens from the body. Stanozolol can be administered orally or intramuscularly. Stanozolol is a synthetic anabolic steroid with therapeutic uses in treating hereditary angioedema. Stanozolol is derived from testosterone, and has been abused by several high profile professional athletes.Stanozolol is a synthetic anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS), which promotes cell growth (anabolism) and development/maintenance of masculine characteristics (androgenism). Stanozolol binds to androgen receptors, such as membrane bound receptor proteins LAGS and stanozolol-binding protein (STBP)."
1165,"Buserelin may be used in the treatment of hormone-responsive cancers such as prostate cancer or breast cancer, estrogen-dependent conditions (such as endometriosis or uterine fibroids), and in assisted reproduction.Buserelin is a synthetic peptide analog of the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist, which stimulates the pituitary gland's gonadotrophin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR). Buserelin also has a longer duration of action than natural LHRH. Investigations in healthy adult males and females have demonstrated that the increase in plasma LH and FSH levels persist for at least 7 hours and that a return to basal values requires about 24 hours. Clinical inhibition of gonadotropin release, and subsequent reduction of serum testosterone or estradiol to castration level, was found when large pharmacologic doses (50-500 mcg SC/day or 300-1200 mcg IN/day) were administered for periods greater than 1 to 3 months. While initially, there is a rise in FSH and LH levels, chronic administration of Buserelin results in a sustained suppression of these hormones."

1167,"For the treatment of acute mild to moderate pain, as well as pain and inflammation of the joints caused by certain types of rheumatic diseases.Lornoxicam (chlortenoxicam) is a new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of the oxicam class with analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties. Lornoxicam differs from other oxicam compounds in its potent inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis, a property that explains the particularly pronounced efficacy of the drug. As with other NSAIDS, lornoxicam is a potent inhibitor of the cyclooxgenase enzymes, which are responsible for catalyzing the formation of prostaglandins (act as messenger molecules in the process of inflammation) and thromboxane from arachidonic acid. Unlike some NSAIDS, lornoxicam's inhibition of cyclooxygenase does not lead to an increase in leukotriene formation, meaning that arachidonic acid is not moved to the 5-lipoxygenase cascade, resulting in the minimization of the risk of adverse events.Like other NSAIDS, lornoxicam's anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity is related to its inhibitory action on prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis through the inhibition of both COX-1 and COX-2. However, the exact mechanism of lornoxicam, like that of the other NSAIDs, has not been fully determined."
1168,"Sparteine is a plant alkaloid derived from Cytisus scoparius and Lupinus mutabilis which may chelate calcium and magnesium. It is a sodium channel blocker, so it falls in the category of class 1a antiarrhythmic agents.

1170,"Aceclofenac is an oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with marked anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties used to treat osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Aceclofenac potently inhibits the cyclo-oxygenase enzyme (COX) that is involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins, which are inflammatory mediators that cause pain, swelling, inflammation, and fever. Although the mode of action of aceclofenac is thought to mainly arise from the inhibition of synthesis of prostaglandins (PGE2), aceclofenac also inhibits the production of inflammatory cytokines, interleukins (IL-1β, IL-6), and tumor necrosis factors (TNF) . It is also reported that aceclofenac also affects the cell adhesion molecules from neutrophils . Inhibition of IL-6 is thought to be mediated by diclofenac converted from aceclofenac ."

1176,"Betaine reduces plasma homocysteine levels in patients with homocystinuria. In patients with MTHFR deficiency and cbl defects, betaine may increase methionine and S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) plasma levels. This condition can be caused by deficiencies or defects in cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), and cobalamin cofactor metabolism (cbl). CBS converts homocysteine to cystathionine, and a deficiency in this enzyme can lead to an accumulation of homocysteine. Additionally, a defect in cobalamin (vitamin B12) cofactor metabolism can lead to homocystinuria, since a metabolite of cobalamin (methylcobalamin) promotes the conversion of homocysteine to methionine."
1177,"The drug was withdrawn by the FDA because while there was a high unmet need for drugs to treat CMV when the drug was initially discovered and developed due to the CMV arising in people with AIDS, the development of HAART dramatically reduced the number of cases of CMV.

Capsaicin is a naturally-occurring botanical irritant in chili peppers, synthetically derived for pharmaceutical formulations. When activated by a combination of these factors, the channel can transiently open and initiate depolarization due to the influx of calcium and sodium ions. Because TRPV1 is commonly expressed in A-delta and mostly C fibers, depolarization results in action potentials which send impulses to the brain and spinal cord."
1185,"Chenodiol will not dissolve calcified (radiopaque) or radiolucent bile pigment stones.Chenodeoxycholic acid (or Chenodiol) is an epimer of ursodeoxycholic acid (DB01586). It works by dissolving the cholesterol that makes gallstones and inhibiting production of cholesterol in the liver and absorption in the intestines, which helps to decrease the formation of gallstones. It can also reduce the amount of other bile acids that can be harmful to liver cells when levels are elevated.It acts by reducing levels of cholesterol in the bile, helping gallstones that are made predominantly of cholesterol to dissolve. Chenodeoxycholic acid is ineffective with stones of a high calcium or bile acid content.Chenodiol suppresses hepatic synthesis of both cholesterol and cholic acid, gradually replacing the latter and its metabolite, deoxycholic acid in an expanded bile acid pool. Bile acids may also bind the the bile acid receptor (FXR) which regulates the synthesis and transport of bile acids."
1186,"Anti-Xa activity of plasma is used as both as an estimate of clotting activity, and as a basis to determine dosage. In these patients, unfractionated heparin should only be used. As for monitoring, active partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) will only increase at high doses of low molecular weight heparins (LMWH).

Owing to the continuous release of free iodine, it can enable the skin and mucous membranes to maintain a certain effective concentration of iodine for killing bacteria. It is mainly used for gynecological vaginal infection. Published reports on the in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of iodophors demonstrate that iodophors are bactericidal, mycobactericidal, and virucidal but can require prolonged contact times to kill certain fungi and bacterial spores. The virucidal activity of 75–150 ppm available iodine was demonstrated against seven viruses."
1200,"Pralatrexate is designed to have a higher affinity for the reduced folate carrier, a protein that is overexpressed in malignant cells and is upregulated by oncogenes. It is also being studied for other types of lymphoma and solid malignancy such as non-small-cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and bladder cancer.Pralatrexate is a folate analog that inhibits folate metabolism, thus impeding the synthesis of amino acids and nucleic acid. Compared to methotrexate, pralatrexate binds to the reduced folate carrier protein-1 (RFC-1) for cellular uptake with 10-times the affinity and is a more potent substrate for FPGS. Folate is a water-soluble vitamin required for DNA synthesis and maintenance as well as DNA, RNA, and protein methylation. This reaction both increases cellular retention of pralatrexate for extended drug action and impedes the uptake of folate, also a substrate of FPGS, to further inhibit folate metabolism in cancer cells."

1216,"Potential in the treatment and the management of acid-reflux disorders (GERD), peptic ulcer disease, heartburn, and acid indigestion.Metiamide is an H-2 receptor antagonist derived from burimamide. It was an intermediate product on the path to developing cimetidine.Metiamide is a histamine H2-receptor antagonist. It reduces basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion and a reduction in gastric volume, acidity, and amount of gastric acid released in response to stimuli including food, caffeine, insulin, betazole, or pentagastrin. Metiamide inhibits many of the isoenzymes of the hepatic CYP450 enzyme system. Other actions of Metiamide include an increase in gastric bacterial flora such as nitrate-reducing organisms.Metiamide binds to an H2-receptor located on the basolateral membrane of the gastric parietal cell, blocking histamine effects."
1217,"Also for prophylaxis of recurrent gastric and duodenal ulcersRoxatidine acetate is a specific and competitive H2 receptor antagonist. This suppressive action is dose-dependent. As a result, the production and secretion, particularly of gastric acid, are reduced. They suppress the normal secretion of acid by parietal cells and the meal-stimulated secretion of acid. They accomplish this by two mechanisms: histamine released by ECL cells in the stomach is blocked from binding on parietal cell H2 receptors which stimulate acid secretion, and other substances that promote acid secretion (such as gastrin and acetylcholine) have a reduced effect on parietal cells when the H2 receptors are blocked."
1218,"For the management of hypertension, edema, ventricular tachycardias, and atrial fibrillation.Bopindolol (INN) is an ester prodrug for the beta blocker .Bopindolol is a prodrug of pindolol. Pindolol is a non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonist (beta-blocker) which possesses intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) in therapeutic dosage ranges but does not possess quinidine-like membrane stabilizing activity. Pindolol impairs AV node conduction and decreases sinus rate and may also increase plasma triglycerides and decrease HDL-cholesterol levels. Pindolol is nonpolar and hydrophobic, with low to moderate lipid solubility. Pindolol has little to no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and, unlike some other beta-adrenergic blocking agents, pindolol has little direct myocardial depressant activity and does not have an anesthetic-like membrane-stabilizing action.Bopindolol (as pindolol) non-selectively blocks beta-1 adrenergic receptors mainly in the heart, inhibiting the effects of epinephrine and norepinephrine resulting in a decrease in heart rate and blood pressure."

Temocaprilat has slightly higher potency than enalaprilat in ACE inhibition isolated from rabbit lung. ACE inhibitors exert their hemodynamic effect mainly by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system."
1231,"Increasing use of the statin class of drugs is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. In most cases, muscle symptoms and CK increases resolved when treatment was promptly discontinued. The risk of myopathy during treatment with pitavstatin may be increased with concurrent administration of interacting drugs such as , , , and . Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors coadministered with , and caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing these two medications together."

Mirabegron has a comparatively favorable adverse effect profile as compared to other available treatment options, and its complementary mechanism to the antimuscarinics that came before it allows for its use alongside solifenacin in refractory cases. Mirabegron first received FDA approval in 2012, under the brand name Myrbetriq, for the treatment of adults with overactive bladder. Mirabegron is also used in other jurisdictions across the globe, including Canada, the EU, and Japan.Mirabegron exerts its pharmacologic effects by forcing bladder smooth muscle to relax, thereby expanding its capacity and relieving urgency. Furthermore, mirabegron increases both blood pressure and heart rate in a dose-dependent manner and should therefore be used with caution in patients with severely uncontrolled hypertension or others for whom these increases may prove dangerous.Mirabegron is a potent and selective agonist of beta-3 adrenergic receptors."
1254,"Tofacitinib is not recommended to be used in combination with other biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or potent immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine or cyclosporine.Tofacitinib is an inhibitor of Janus kinases, a group of intracellular enzymes involved in signalling pathways that affect hematopoiesis and immune cell function. Tofacitinib is marketed under the brand name Xeljanz by Pfizer.Tofacitinib targets inflammation present in rheumatoid arthritis by inhibiting the janus kinases involved in the inflammatory response pathway. More serious immunologic and hematological adverse effects have also been noted resulting in lymphopenia, neutropenia, anemia, and increased risk of cancer and infection. Therapy is not to be started in the presence of active infection, systemic or localized, and is to be interrupted if a serious infection occurs. The JAK-STAT signalling pathway is involved in the transcription of cells involved in hematopoiesis, and immune cell function."
1255,"Regorafenib is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) who have been previously treated with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based chemotherapy, an anti-VEGF therapy, and, if KRAS wild type, an anti-EGFR therapy. Regorafenib is also indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) who have been previously treated with imatinib mesylate and sunitinib malate. Regorafenib is also indicated for the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) previously treated with sorafenib.Regorafenib is an orally-administered inhibitor of multiple kinases. FDA approved on September 27, 2012.

1256,"It has a much higher propensity to bind to muscarinic receptors than nicotinic receptors. FDA approved on July 24, 2012.Aclidinium does not prolong the QTc interval or have significant effects on cardiac rhythm. Aclidinium is a long-acting, competitive, and reversible anticholinergic drug that is specific for the acetylcholine muscarinic receptors. Aclidinium's effects on the airways are mediated through the M3 receptor at the smooth muscle to cause bronchodilation. Prevention of acetylcholine-induced bronchoconstriction effects was dose-dependent and lasted longer than 24 hours."
1257,"Enzalutamide is indicated for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer, metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC), and non-metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (nmCSPC) with biochemical recurrence at high risk for metastasis (high-risk BCR).Enzalutamide is an androgen receptor (AR) inhibitor for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), both metastatic and non-metastatic. Compared to the average time of 10 to 15 years for a drug to go from pre-clinical to clinical studies, enzalutamide was developed relatively rapidly.Enzalutamide is a second-generation antiandrogen that blocks the activity of androgen and androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer. However, resistance will eventually arise after the commencement of ADT in 2-3 years due to the accumulation of mutations, including constitutively active mutation, AR overexpression, and changes in AR splicing variants. Clinical trials on prostate cancer patients indicated that enzalutamide can lead to a decrease in serum PSA for at least 12 weeks, although this response can be short-lived and thus resulting in enzalutamide resistance. Patients receiving enzalutamide also had a 37% decreased in the risk of death compared to placebo.Enzalutamide is a competitive androgen receptor (AR) inhibitor that has a threefold inhibition on the androgen signaling pathway without significant AR agonist activity."
1258,"FDA approved on December 14, 2012.Ponatinib is a multi-target kinase inhibitor. Its primary cellular target is the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase protein which is constitutively active and promotes the progression of CML. This protein arises from the fused Bcr and Abl gene- what is commonly known as the Philadelphia chromosome. Ponatinib is unique in that it is especially useful in the treatment of resistant CML because it inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of Abl and T315I mutant kinases. The T315I mutation confers resistance in cells as it prevents other Bcr-Abl inhibitors from binding to the Abl kinase."
1259,"This indication is approved under FDA accelerated approval based on time to sputum culture conversion. It is the first drug that was approved in the last 40 years by the FDA for TB unresponsive to current treatments on the market. Bedaquiline inhibits mycobacterial TB at a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) from 0.002-0.06 μg/ml and with a MIC50 of 0.03 μg/ml. Target-based mutations generated in preclinical studies lead to 8- to 133-fold increases in bedaquiline MIC, resulting in MICs ranging from 0.25 to 4 micrograms per mL. Bedaquiline is a diarylquinoline antimycobacterial drug that inhibits mycobacterial ATP (adenosine 5'-triphosphate) synthase, by binding to subunit c of the enzyme that is essential for the generation of energy in M. tuberculosis."
1260,"Certolizumab pegol has been approved for several different conditions listed below:    - Symptomatic management of Chron's disease patients and for the maintenance of clinical response in patients with moderate to severe disease with inadequate response to conventional therapy. In Canada, certolizumab pegol is additionally approved in combination with  for the symptomatic treatment, including major clinical response, and for the reduction of joint damage in adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis. Certolizumab does not require glycosylation for active function and hence, its production is significantly more affordable when compared to other existing TNF-alpha therapies as it can be done directly in bacterial hosts such as _E. However, in other additional trials, certolizumab was proven to present a similar clinical efficacy to other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in patients with inadequate response to TNF inhibitors.Certolizumab targets the activation of TNF-alpha with high affinity (KD 90 pM and IC90 0.004 mcg/ml) which inhibits the downstream inflammatory process. The inhibition of TNF-alpha is achieved in a dose-dependent manner and it does not present activity against lymphotoxin alpha (TNF-beta)."
1261,"Though effective for the treatment of asthma, corticosteroids may not affect symptoms immediately. Trials in subjects with asthma have shown a favorable ratio between topical anti-inflammatory activity and systemic corticosteroid effects with recommended doses of orally inhaled fluticasone furoate. For subjects with asthma, a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial in 104 pediatric subjects showed no difference between once-daily treatment with 50 mcg fluticasone compared with placebo on serum cortisol weighted mean (0 to 24 hours) and serum cortisol AUC(0-24) following 6 weeks of treatment. A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial in 185 subjects with asthma aged 12 to 65 years showed no difference between once-daily treatment with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 100 mcg/25 mcg or fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 200 mcg/25 mcg compared with placebo on serum cortisol weighted mean (0 to 24 hours), serum cortisol AUC(0-24), and 24-hour urinary cortisol after 6 weeks of treatment, whereas prednisolone 10 mg given once daily for 7 days resulted in significant cortisol suppression. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids may contribute to their efficacy."
1262,"This drug is used in conjunction with diet and exercise to increase glycemic control in adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus . Another indication for canagliflozin is the prevention of major cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or death due to a cardiovascular cause) in patients with type 2 diabetes, as well as hospitalization for heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes. It was initially approved by the FDA in 2013 for the management of diabetes and later approved in 2018 for a second indication of reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus , . Long-term glycemic control has been proven to be effective in the prevention of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke in patients with type 2 diabetes . This inhibition leads to lower reabsorption of filtered glucose into the body and decreases the renal threshold for glucose (RTG), leading to increased glucose excretion in the urine ."
1263,"Dimethyl fumarate is indicated for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), including clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease, in adults.Dimethyl fumarate is an agent indicated for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. It has anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects, likely involved in its actions in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Dimethyl fumarate may also cause anaphylaxis and angioedema.The mechanism of action of dimethyl fumarate in multiple sclerosis is not well understood. Both dimethyl fumarate and MMF up-regulate the Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) pathway that is activated in response to oxidative stress. It has been suggested that dimethyl fumarate exerts its immunomodulatory effects through changes in the composition and phenotype of immune cells."
1264,"It is also indicated for the treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) in AIDS patients who have failed highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and for the treatment of KS in HIV-negative patients.Pomalidomide, an analogue of thalidomide, is an immunomodulatory antineoplastic agent. FDA approved on February 8, 2013.Pomalidomide is more potent than thalidomide (100-times) and lenalidomide (10-times). Promalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent with antineoplastic activity. It is shown to inhibit the proliferation and induce apoptosis of various tumour cells. It binds to this target and inhibits ubiquitin ligase activity."
1265,"Trametinib is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of BRAF-inhibitor treatment-naïve patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations. Trametinib is not indicated for the treatment of patients with colorectal cancer because of known intrinsic resistance to BRAF inhibition.Trametinib is an orally bioavailable mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2 inhibitor. It was first approved by the FDA in May 2013 for the treatment of melanoma. Trametinib is currently approved to treat a variety of cancers with BRAF mutations, such as non-small cell lung cancer and thyroid cancer, as monotherapy or in combination with , a BRAF inhibitor, for improved therapeutic efficacy. The combined use of trametinib and dabrafenib, a BRAF inhibitor, results in more significant growth inhibition of BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumour cell lines _in vitro_ and prolonged inhibition of tumour growth in BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumour xenografts compared to either drug alone."
1266,"In combination with , dabrafenib is indicated to treat for:    - the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations as detected by an FDA-approved test. - treatment of adult and pediatric patients six years and older with unresectable or metastatic solid tumours with BRAF V600E mutation who have progressed following prior treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on the overall response rate and duration of response. It was approved on May 29, 2013, for the treatment of melanoma with V600E or V6000K mutation. BRAF is a serine/threonine protein kinase and is involved in activating the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK or MAPK pathway, a pathway that is implicated in cell cycle progression, cell proliferation, and arresting apoptosis.Therefore, constitutive active mutation of BRAF such as BRAF V600E is frequently observed in many types of cancer, including melanoma, lung cancer, and colon cancer."
1267,"Investigated for use in patients with type II diabetes to reduce their risks of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity.Aleglitazar is an investigational drug from the company Hoffmann–La Roche and is currently in a phase III clinical trial called ALECARDIO. It is being investigated for use in patients with type II diabetes to reduce their risks of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Aleglitazar is an agonist at the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) for both the PPARα and PPARγ receptor subtypes. In the phase II clinical trial called SYNCHRONY, with type II diabetic patients, aleglitazar was able to control both lipid and glucose levels in a synergistic manner while also having limited side effects and toxicity.Aleglitazar was rationally designed to be an agonist at the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) for both the PPARα and PPARγ receptor subtypes. Agonistic action at PPARα controls lipid levels, which improves dyslipidemia, and agonistic action at PPARγ controls glucose levels, which improves insulin sensitivity in diabetes."
1268,"Recently, as of January 2018, the US FDA approved a supplemental New Drug Application for Boehringer Ingelheim's Gilotrif (afatinib) for the first line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have non-resistant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations as detected by an FDA-approved test . For oral use, afatinib tablets are a first-line (initial) treatment for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with common epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations as detected by an FDA-approved test . NSCLC tumors with common activating EGFR mutations (Del 19, L858R) and several less common EGFR mutations in exon 18 (G719X) and exon 21 (L861Q) are particularly sensitive to afatinib treatment in non-clinical and clinical settings . Non-resistant mutations are defined as those occurring in exons constituting the kinase domain of EGFR that lead to increased receptor activation and where efficacy is predicted by 1) clinically meaningful tumor shrinkage with the recommended dose of afatinib and/or 2) inhibition of cellular proliferation or EGFR tyrosine kinase phosphorylation at concentrations of afatinib sustainable at the recommended dosage according to validated methods . Moreover, afatinib demonstrated inhibition of autophosphorylation and/or in vitro proliferation of cell lines expressing wild-type EGFR and in those expressing selected EGFR exon 19 deletion mutations, exon 21 L858R mutations, or other less common non-resistant mutations, at afatinib concentrations achieved in patients ."
1269,"Levomilnacipran is a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults.Levomilnacipran is a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), although it is a more potent inhibitor of norepinephrine reuptake than serotonin reuptake. Levomilnacipran is the more active 1S,2R-enantiomer in the racemate . Once administered, interconversion between levomilnacipran and its stereoisomer does not occur in humans. Levomilnacipran does not bind to any other receptors, ion channels, or transporters, including serotonergic (5HT1-7), α- and β adrenergic, muscarinic, or histaminergic receptors and Ca2+, Na+, K+ or Cl- channels to a significant degree. Like milnacipran, levomilnacipran is a more potent inhibitor of the norepinephrine transporter than the serotonin transporter: it exhibits over a 15-fold higher selectivity for norepinephrine versus serotonin reuptake inhibition."
1270,"Used as an appetite suppressant.Amfecloral is a stimulant drug of the phenethylamine and amphetamine chemical classes. For a short period of time, it was available under the brand Acutran and indicated as an appetite suppressant, but this product no longer exists. It acts as a prodrug which splits to form amphetamine and chloral hydrate, similarly to clobenzorex and related compounds, except that the N-substituent, in this case, yields a compound that is active in its own right. The chloral hydrate metabolite is a gabaminergic sedative/hypnotic, and would in theory counteract some of the stimulant effects of the amphetamine metabolite."
1271,"Dolutegravir is an HIV-1 integrase inhibitor that blocks the strand transfer step of the integration of the viral genome into the host cell (INSTI). The effect of this drug has no homology in human host cells, which gives it excellent tolerability and minimal toxicity.

1273,Macitentan is indicated for the treatment of WHO group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) both alone and in combination with tadalafil.Macitentan is a dual endothelin receptor antagonist used in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Macitentan differs from its predecessor  due to its lower risk of hepatotoxicity.Macitentan acts primarily by reducing vasoconstriction and cell proliferation due to endothelin overexpression.Macitentan is an antagonist which binds to the endothelin A and B receptors (EA and EB) and blocks signaling from endothelin-1 and -2. EA receptor activation is also known to contribute to pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell proliferation. The binding of endothelins to the EB receptors acts in opposition to EA signaling by activating the same PLC cascade in endothelial cells to activate endothelial nitric oxide synthase. Macitentan is thought to provide its therapeutic effect primarily via blocking signaling through EA which produces both decreased vasoconstriction via reduced smooth muscle cell contractility and attenuation of the hyperproliferation of smooth muscle cells found in PAH.
1274,"Luliconazole is indicated for the treatment of interdigital tinea pedis, tinea cruris, or tinea corporis infections caused by Trichophyton rubrum and Epidermophyton floccosum.Luliconazole is a topical antifungal agent that acts by unknown mechanisms but is postulated to involve altering the synthesis of fungi cell membranes.

1310,"Has been used in the management of epilepsy and epilepsy related behavioural disorders. It was used for generalised tonic-clonic seizures, and was not effective for absence seizures. More recently focus has shifted to the use of beclamide in behavioural disorders. In one study using rats, beclamide was seen to reduce striatal dopamine and serotonin levels and increase the levels of dopamine's major metabolites (and thus dopamine turnover), while reducing the levels of serotonin's major metabolite below detectable levels. It is theorized that animal aggression is linked to levels of biogenic monoamines such as dopamine and serotonin, however the exact role is unclear."

1317,"Benzoctamine is a drug with two main uses. It can be used as a sedative which does not depress the respiratory system, but rather stimulates it. It can also be used as an anxiolytic with the same efficacy as chlordiazepoxide for treating anxiety neurosis.Benzoctamine acts as a sedative and axiolytic agent .The exact mechanism by which bezoctamine reduces anxiety and produces sedation is unknown. It has been found to increase serotonin levels in the forebrain which may mediate anxiolytic effects similar to those of serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors ."
1318,Benfluorex is an anorectic and hypolipidemic agent that is structurally related to fenfluramine. It was patented and manufactured by a French pharmaceutical company Servier. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended withdrawing all benfluorex containing medicines on 18 December 2009. This recommendation was based on the risks (especially fenfluramine-like cardiovascular side-effects) outweighing the benefits.
1319,"Aliskiren is used for the treatment of hypertension in children above 6 years and adults.Aliskiren is the first drug in the renin inhibitor drug class and is used for the treatment of hypertension. It was developed by Speedel and Novartis and initially approved by the FDA in early 2007.Aliskiren reduces blood pressure by inhibiting renin. It normally cleaves the protein angiotensinogen to form angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is then converted to angiotensin II, an active protein. Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor that causes the release of catecholamines into the circulation. This ends the cascade of angiotensin II mediated mechanisms that normally increase blood pressure."
1320,"Secukinumab is indicated the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in patients six years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. In the US, it is approved for patients four year of age and older.In the US, secukinumab is indicated for the treatment of adults with active ankylosing spondylitis, non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with objective signs of inflammation, moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa.Secukinumab is a fully human monoclonal IgG1/κ antibody against interleukin-17A (IL-17A), a proinflammatory cytokine implicated in various chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disorders, such as plaque psoriasis.

1321,"Vorapaxar is indicated for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) or peripheral arterial disease (PAD).Vorapaxar is a tricyclic himbacine-derived selective inhibitor of protease activated receptor (PAR-1) indicated for reducing the incidence of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) or with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). By inhibiting PAR-1, a thrombin receptor expressed on platelets, vorapaxar prevents thrombin-related platelet aggregation.Vorapaxar inhibits platelet aggregation through the reversible antagonism of protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1), also known as thrombin receptor. PARs are a family of G-protein coupled receptors highly expressed on platelets and activated by serine protease activity of thrombin to mediate thrombotic response. By blocking PAR-1 activating, vorapaxar inhibits thrombin-induced platelet aggregation and thrombin receptor agonist peptide (TRAP)-induced platelet aggregation. Vorapaxar does not inhibit platelet aggregation induced by other agonists such as adenosine diphosphate (ADP), collagen or a thromboxane mimetic."
1322,"Vedolizumab is indicated for adult patients with moderately to severely active Ulcerative Colitis or Crohn’s disease. The interaction of the α4β7 integrin with MAdCAM-1 has been implicated as an important contributor to chronic inflammation, a hallmark of ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. Inhibition of α4β7 integrin by vedolizumab prevents the adhesion of lymphocytes to its natural ligand, thus decreasing the migration of memory T-lymphocytes across the endothelium into inflamed gastrointestinal parenchymal tissue. A reduction in gastrointestinal inflammation was observed in rectal biopsy specimens from Phase 2 ulcerative colitis patients exposed to vedolizumab for four or six weeks compared to placebo control as assessed by histopathology. In a study of 14 healthy subjects, vedolizumab did not affect the CD4+ lymphocyte cell counts, CD8+ lymphocyte cell counts, or the CD4+:CD8+ ratios in the CSF.Vedolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the α4β7 integrin and blocks the interaction of α4β7 integrin with MAdCAM-1."
1323,"Suvorexant is indicated for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance.Suvorexant is a selective dual antagonist of orexin receptors OX1R and OX2R that promotes sleep by reducing wakefulness and arousal. It has been approved for the treatment of insomnia.Suvorexant is a dual antagonist of orexin receptors OX1R and OX2R. It exerts its pharmacological effect by inhibiting binding of neuropeptides orexin A and B, also known as hypocretin 1 and 2, that are produced by neurons in the lateral hypothalamus. These neurons control the wake-promoting centers of the brain and are active during wakefulness, especially during motor activities, and stop firing during sleep. By inhibiting the reinforcement of arousal systems, suvorexant use causes a decrease in arousal and wakefulness, rather than having a direct sleep-promoting effect."
1324,"Nivolumab is indicated to treat unresectable or metastatic melanoma, melanoma as adjuvant treatment, resectable or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, advanced renal cell carcinoma, classical Hodgkin lymphoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, urothelial carcinoma, microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair deficient metastatic colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and esophageal cancer.

1325,"Siltuximab is indicated for the treatment of patients with multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD) who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative and human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) negative. Its use is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD) who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative and human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) negative. It is administered as a 1 hour intravenous infusion every 3 weeks.Siltuximab-neutralized antibody-IL-6 complexes interfere with current immunological-based IL-6 quantification methods, therefore measurement of serum or plasma IL-6 concentrations should not be used as a pharmacodynamic marker during treatment. By preventing IL-6 signalling through treatment with siltuximab, CYP450 activity may be increased leading to faster metabolism of drugs that are CYP450 substrates. Siltuximab complexes with human IL-6 and prevents binding to soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors, thereby inhibiting the proliferation of lymphocytes."
1326,"Pembrolizumab is indicated for the following conditions: Melanoma  - for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma (adult patients in the US and patients ≥12 years old in the EU)  - for the adjuvant treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with Stage IIB, IIC, or III melanoma following complete resection . Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC)  - for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with recurrent locally advanced or metastatic MCC .Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)  - in combination with either  or  as a first-line treatment for adult patients with advanced RCC  - for the adjuvant treatment of patients with RCC who are at an intermediate-high or high risk of recurrence following nephrectomy, or following nephrectomy and resection of metastatic lesions .Endometrial Carcinoma  - in combination with lenvatinib for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma that is not MSI-H or dMMR who experience disease progression following prior systemic therapy and who are not candidates for surgery or radiation therapy  - as a monotherapy for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma that is MSI-H or dMMR who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation .Tumor Mutational Burden-High (TMB-H) Cancer  - as a last-line therapy for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with unresectable or metastatic TMB-H solid tumors that have progressed following prior treatment .Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (cSCC)  - for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic sCC, or locally advanced sCC that is not curable with surgery or radiation therapy .Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)  - for the treatment of patients with high-risk early-stage TNBC, in combination with chemotherapy as a neoadjuvant treatment followed by continued use as a single adjuvant agent following surgery  - in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of locally recurrent unresectable or metastatic TNBC expressing PD-L1    For all approved adult indications, pembrolizumab may be used for an additional 6 weeks at 400mg weekly.Pembrolizumab is a highly selective IgG4-kappa humanized monoclonal antibody against PD-1 receptors. It was generated by grafting the variable sequences of a very high-affinity mouse antihuman PD-1 antibody onto a human IgG4-kappa isotype containing a stabilizing S228P Fc mutation. In the time since its initial approval, pembrolizumab has been granted approval in the treatment of a wide variety of cancers.Pembrolizumab exerts its pharmacologic effects by releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response, which in turn improves the anti-tumor immune response. The binding of pembrolizumab to PD-1 prevents this inhibitory pathway, causing a physiological shift towards immune reactivity and enhancing tumor immunosurveillance and anti-tumor immune response."
1327,"Empagliflozin is not approved for use in patients with type 1 diabetes.Empagliflozin is an inhibitor of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2), the transporters primarily responsible for the reabsorption of glucose in the kidney. The first known inhibitor of SGLTs, phlorizin, was isolated from the bark of apple trees in 1835 and researched extensively into the 20th century, but was ultimately deemed inappropriate for clinical use given its lack of specificity and significant gastrointestinal side effects. As its mechanism of action is contingent on the renal excretion of glucose, empagliflozin may be held in cases of acute kidney injury and/or discontinued in patients who develop chronic renal disease. SGLT2 on the apical membrane of these cells then utilize this gradient to facilitate secondary active co-transport of both Na+ and glucose out of the filtrate, thereby reabsorbing glucose back into the blood – inhibiting this co-transport, then, allows for a marked increase in glucosuria and decrease in blood glucose levels. Empagliflozin is a potent inhibitor of renal SGLT2 transporters located in the proximal tubules of the kidneys and works to lower blood glucose levels via an increase in glucosuria."
1328,"Eliglustat is a glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor indicated for the long-term treatment of type 1 Gaucher disease in adult patients who are CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EMs), intermediate metabolizers (IMs), or poor metabolizers (PMs) as detected by an FDA-cleared test.

1336,"Indicated for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in adult patients with chronic non-cancer pain.Naloxegol, for ""PEGylated naloxol"" is a peripherally-selective opioid antagonist developed by AstraZeneca. It was approved by the FDA in September 2014 and is indicated for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in adult patients with chronic non‑cancer pain. The advantage of naloxegol over the opioid antagonist naloxone is that its PEGylated structure allows for high selectivity for peripheral opioid receptors and lack of entry into the central nervous system through the blood-brain barrier.Use of opioids induces slowing of gastrointestinal motility and transit. Antagonism of gastrointestinal mu-opioid receptors by naloxegol inhibits opioid-induced delay of gastrointestinal transit time.Naloxegol is an antagonist of opioid binding at the mu-opioid receptor. Naloxegol has shown more than 6000 fold selectivity for the peripheral mu receptors, and its PEGylated form restricts its action only to the periphery, not affecting the pain-relieving mechanism of opioids in the central nervous system."

It is not interchangeable with ritonavir to increase systemic exposure of darunavir 600 mg twice daily, fosamprenavir, saquinavir, or tipranavir due to lack of exposure data. Cobicistat may result in different drug interactions .Cobicistat, marketed under the name Tybost (formerly GS-9350), indicated for treating infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Although it does not have any anti-HIV activity, cobicistat acts as a pharmacokinetic enhancer by inhibiting cytochrome P450 3A isoforms (CYP3A) and therefore increases the systemic exposure of coadministered agents that are metabolized by CYP3A enzymes. Increasing systemic exposure of anti-retrovirals (ARVs) without increasing dosage allows for better treatment outcomes and a decreased side effect profile.Cobicistat is a mechanism-based inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) isoforms."
1345,"Vortioxetine is indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD).Vortioxetine is an antidepressant medication indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). More specifically, vortioxetine acts via the following biological mechanisms: as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) through inhibition of the serotonin transporter, as a partial agonist of the 5-HT1B receptor, an agonist of 5-HT1A, and an antagonist of the 5-HT3, 5-HT1D, and 5-HT7 receptors. Some serotonin receptors seem to play a relatively neutral or insignificant role in the regulation of mood, but others, such as 5-HT1A autoreceptors and 5-HT7 receptors, appear to play an oppositional role in the efficacy of SRIs in treating depression.Vortioxetine binds with high affinity to the human serotonin transporter (Ki=1.6 nM), but not to the norepinephrine (Ki=113 nM) or dopamine (Ki>1000 nM) transporters. Vortioxetine potently and selectively inhibits reuptake of serotonin by inhibition of the serotonin transporter (IC50=5.4 nM). Specifically, vortioxetine binds to 5­HT3 (Ki=3.7 nM), 5­HT1A (Ki=15 nM), 5­HT7 (Ki=19 nM), 5­HT1D (Ki=54 nM), and 5­HT1B (Ki=33 nM), receptors and is a 5­HT3, 5­HT1D, and 5­HT7 receptor antagonist, 5­HT1B receptor partial agonist, and 5­HT1A receptor agonist.Vortioxetine is classified as a serotonin modulator and simulator (SMS) as it has a multimodal mechanism of action towards the serotonin neurotransmitter system whereby it simultaneously modulates one or more serotonin receptors and inhibits the reuptake of serotonin."
1346,"For the relief of post-menopausal symptoms and for the prevention of osteoporosis .Tibolone is a synthetic steroid hormone drug, which is mainly non-selective in its binding profile, acting as an agonist primarily at estrogen receptors (ER), with a preference for ER alpha . Typical, drugs that treat post-menopausal symptoms such as estrogen, have a proliferative effect on the endometrium, increasing the risk of endometrial carcinoma . The effects on the bone, brain and vaginal tissues can be explained by the estrogenic activity of tibolone. Breast tissue of monkeys is not found to be stimulated after tibolone administration,  as occurs with estrogen plus progesterone used in combination. In a study of monkeys, breast tissue was not stimulated, which occurs with estrogen and progesterone, because tibolone and its metabolites inhibit _sulfatase and 17 beta-hydroxysteroid _dehydrogenase (HSD) type I and stimulate _sulfotransferase and 17 beta-HSD type II_."

Occurring commonly in blind individuals without light perception, this condition is often characterized by periods of night-time insomnia and day-time sleepiness. In blind individuals, a lack of light stimulation causes an extension of the 24-hour circadian cycle and can lead to progressively delayed sleep onset. By activating melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the brain, tasimelteon has been shown to improve sleep by resynchronizing the circadian rhythm through its ""non-photic"" mechanism."
1348,"It is as well approved in combination with  in patients with disease progression with prior endocrine therapy. The breast cancer starts as a group of cancer cells that grow into and destroy the nearby breast tissue. In vitro studies showed the potential for palbociclib to reduce cellular proliferation of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cell lines through the inhibition of the cell-cycle progression from G1 to S phase. In clinical trials, palbociclib, in combination with letrozole, was shown to significantly increase the progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with metastatic breast cancer without prior endocrine treatment. Hence, inhibition of this step prevents cell cycle progression in cells in whose this pathway is functioning."
1349,"**Breast cancer**    Olaparib is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious g_BRCA_m human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative high risk early breast cancer who have been treated with neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. **Pancreatic cancer**    Olaparib is indicated for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious gBRCAm metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma whose disease has not progressed on at least 16 weeks of a first-line platinum-based chemotherapy regimen. **Prostate cancer**    Olaparib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or somatic homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have progressed following prior treatment with a hormone agent, such as  or . It is also indicated in combination with  and  or  for the treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious BRCA-mutated (BRCAm) metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).Olaparib is a selective and potent inhibitor of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes, PARP1 and PARP2. The drug exerts anti-tumour effects in cell lines and mouse tumour models with deficiencies in BRCA1/2, ATM, or other genes involved in the homologous recombination repair (HRR) of DNA damage and correlated with platinum response."
1350,"However, it should not be used in patients with creatinine clearance (CrCL) > 95 mL/min because of increased risk of ischemic stroke compared to warfarin at the highest dose studied (60 mg). By inhibiting factor Xa, a key protein in the coagulation cascade, edoxaban prevents the stepwise amplification of protein factors needed to form blood clots. It is indicated to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism (SE) in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) following 5-10 days of initial therapy with a parenteral anticoagulant. Traditionally, warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, was used for stroke prevention in these individuals but effective use of this drug is limited by it's delayed onset, narrow therapeutic window, need for regular monitoring and INR testing, and numerous drug-drug and drug-food interactions. This has prompted enthusiasm for newer agents such as dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban for effective clot prevention."
1351,"Umeclidinium is approved by the FDA and Health Canada for the maintenance treatment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Both products were indicated for the maintenance treatment of COPD, but only the umeclidinium// product was approved for the maintenance treatment of asthma in patients aged 18 years and older.Umeclidinium is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) used as a maintenance treatment for symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Maintenance of the airway is controlled by the parasympathetic nervous system, particularly by the abundance of the muscarinic subtype 3 (M3) in the airway smooth muscle. However, even though umeclidinium monotherapy is well-tolerated for up to 14 days, it is more likely to be used in combination therapy, as the international Gold Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines recommended the use of two long-acting bronchodilators with differing mechanisms of action to maximize efficacy and minimize adverse effects. It has similar affinity to the subtypes of muscarinic receptors M1 to M5."
1352,"Dinutuximab is indicated, in combination with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and 13-cis-retinoic acid (RA), for the treatment of pediatric patients with high-risk neuroblastoma who achieve at least a partial response to prior first-line multiagent, multimodality therapy. Despite a high clinical response seen after first-line treatment, the complete eradication of neuroblastoma is rarely achieved and the majority of patients with advanced disease suffer a relapse. Current strategies for treatment include immunotherapy with drugs such as dinutuximab to target surviving neuroblastoma cells and to prevent relapse.Dinutuximab is an IgG1 monoclonal human/mouse chimeric antibody against GD2, a disialoganglioside expressed on tumors of neuroectodermal origin, including human neuroblastoma and melanoma, with highly restricted expression on normal tissues. It is composed of the variable heavy- and light-chain regions of the murine anti-GD2 mAb 14.18 and the constant regions of human IgG1 heavy-chain and kappa light-chain. Current strategies for treatment include immunotherapy with drugs such as dinutuximab to target surviving neuroblastoma cells and to prevent relapse.In vitro dinutuximab binds to neuroblastoma tumour cells and mediates the lysis of tumour cells via cell-mediated and complement-mediated cytotoxicity."
1353,"Lenvatinib is indicated for the treatment of the following cancerous conditions:    **Differentiated Thyroid Cancer (DTC)**    - Treatment of locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer    **Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)**    - First-line treatment,  in adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC)   - Treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma, in combination with , in adult patients who have previously tried ≥1 anti-angiogenic therapy    **Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)**    - First-line treatment of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma    **Endometrial Carcinoma**    - Treatment of advanced endometrial carcinoma that is not microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR), in combination with , in patients who have experienced disease progression following prior systemic therapy and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiationLenvatinib is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor that inhibits the kinase activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4). Lenvatinib also inhibits other RTKs that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular functions, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4; the platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), KIT, and RET. In particular, VEGF has been identified as a crucial regulator of both physiologic and pathologic angiogenesis and increased expression of VEGF is associated with a poor prognosis in many types of cancers. However, for patients with RAI-refractory thyroid cancer, treatment options are limited and the prognosis is poor, leading to a push for the development of more targeted therapies such as lenvatinib.Based on x-ray crystallography and kinetic interaction studies, lenvatinib binds to the adenosine 5'-triphosphate binding site of VEGFR2 and to a neighbouring region via a cyclopropane ring and thereby inhibits tyrosine kinase activity and associated signalling pathways. Lenvatinib also inhibits other RTKs that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular functions, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4; the platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), KIT, and RET."
1354,"In the EU, under the brand name Vargatef, nintedanib is indicated in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic, locally advanced, or locally recurrent non-small cell lung cancer of adenocarcinoma histology who have already tried first-line therapy.Nintedanib is a small molecule kinase inhibitor used in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis, systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It was first approved for use in the United States in 2014. Within the spectrum of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis treatment options, nintedanib is currently one of only two disease-modifying therapies available and indicated for the condition (the other being ) and as such is  used as a first-line treatment following diagnosis to slow down the progressive loss of lung function. As a chemotherapeutic agent for NSCLC, nintedanib, in combination with , is reserved for patients who have tried and failed first-line chemotherapeutic options.Nintedanib is a small molecule kinase inhibitor that inhibits upstream kinase activity to ultimately inhibit lung fibroblast proliferation and migration, as well as signalling pathways that promote the proliferation and survival of endothelial and perivascular cells in tumour tissues. Nintedanib poses a risk of drug-induced liver injury, especially within the first three months of therapy."
1355,"It is not indicated for the treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD or for the treatment of asthma.Olodaterol is a novel, long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA) that exerts its pharmacological effect by binding and activating beta2-adrenergic receptors located primarily in the lungs. Activation of the receptor stimulates an associated G protein which then activates adenylate cyclase, catalyzing the formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and protein kinase A (PKA). Treatment with bronchodilators helps to mitigate associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough, and sputum production. Despite similarities in symptoms, olodaterol is not indicated for the treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD or for the treatment of asthma.Olodaterol is a potent agonist of the human beta2-adrenergic receptor in vitro, and is highly selective for this receptor, with much lower levels of activity at the b1- and b3-adrenergic receptors that are commonly expressed on cardiac smooth muscle and adipose tissue, respectively. Binding to the receptor causes smooth muscle relaxation in the lungs and bronchodilation."
1356,"Approved by the FDA in 2013, the use of Breo Ellipta is indicated for the long-term, once-daily maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with COPD, including chronic bronchitis and emphysema, as well as the once-daily maintenance treatment of asthma in patients aged 18 or older with reversible obstructive airways disease. Anoro Ellipta is indicated for the maintenance treatment of patients with COPD, and Trelegy Ellipta is indicated for the maintenance treatment of patients with COPD as well as the maintenance treatment of asthma in patients aged 18 years and older.Vilanterol is a selective long-acting β2-adrenergic agonist (LABA) with inherent 24-hour activity for the once-daily treatment of COPD and asthma. This is in response to the need for longer-acting β2-adrenergic agonists to overcome poor patient compliance (due to the frequency of dosing regimens or complexities of drug administration). Vilanterol was designed based on the salmeterol molecular scaffold, particularly as a  antedrug analog of salmeterol modification by modifying the salmeterol molecule to create homochiral compounds with the (R)-configuration. Vilanterol is 1000 and 400 fold more selective for β2 than β1 and β3 adrenoceptors, respectively, with a faster onset of action than salmeterol."
1357,"Ivabradine is indicated by the FDA to reduce the risk of hospitalization for worsening heart failure in adult patients with stable, symptomatic chronic heart failure with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35%, who are in sinus rhythm with resting heart rate ≥70 beats per minute and either are on maximally tolerated doses of beta-blockers or have a contraindication to beta-blocker use. It is also indicated for treatment of stable symptomatic heart failure as a result of dilated cardiomyopathy for pediatric patients 6 months of age or more.Ivabradine is a novel heart rate lowering medicine for the symptomatic management of stable angina pectoralis and symptomatic chronic heart failure. Ivabradine acts by selectively inhibiting the ""funny"" channel pacemaker current (If) in the sinoatrial node in a dose-dependent fashion, resulting in a lower heart rate and thus more blood to flow to the myocardium. Therefore, as ivabradine is designed as a ""pure"" heart rate-lowering drug by selectively acting on the If channels, it may offer a more favorable side effect profile due to its lower likelihood of causing serious adverse effects.The funny channels (If) open during repolarization and close during depolarization, making ivabradine's activity dependent on heart rate or the closing and opening of the channels. This allows for an improved oxygen supply and therefore mitigation of ischemia, allowing for a higher exercise capacity and reduction in angina episodes."
1358,Ophthalmic tetracaine is indicated for the for procedures requiring a rapid and short- acting topical ophthalmic anesthetic.  tetracaine patch is indicated for local dermal analgesia for superficial dermatological procedures and superficial venous access.  tetracaine cream is intended to provide topical local analgesia for superficial dermatological procedures.Tetracaine is an ester local anaesthetic currently available in combination with lidocaine as a cream and patch.Tetracaine is an ester-type anesthetic and produces local anesthesia by blocking the sodium ion channels involved in the initiation and conduction of neuronal impulses.
1359,"Used in the manufacuring of medicated animal feeds .Chlortetracycline is a tetracycline antibiotic, and historically the first member of this class to be identified. It was discovered in 1945 by the scientist, Benjamin Minge Duggar, working at Lederle Laboratories under the supervision of Yellapragada Subbarow. He discovered that this antibiotic was the product of an actinomycete strain he cultured and obtained from a soil sample from a field in Missouri. The organism was named Streptomyces aureofaciens due to its gold-hued color.Tetracycline antibiotics are bacteriostatic agents which act to inhibit bacterial growth and reproduction .Chlortetracycline, like other tetracyclines, competes for the A site of the bacterial ribosome . This binding competes with tRNA carrying amino acids preventing the addition of more amino acids to the peptide chain."
1360,"It is secreted by the D cells of the islets to inhibit the release of insulin and glucagon, and is also generated in the hypothalamus, where it inhibits the release of growth hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormones from the anterior pituitary . is a long-acting analogue of somatostatin that inhibits the release of a number of hormones, and is clinically used to relieve symptoms of uncommon gastroenteropancreatic endocrine tumours, as well as treat acromegaly .Somatostatin is an endogenous peptide hormone that is secreted by the central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, retina, peripheral neurons and pancreatic D cells of the islets of Langerhans. While distribution of two active isoforms of somatostatin is similar, SST-14 is more predominant in the enteric neurons and peripheral nerves whereas SST-28 is more prominent in the retina and intestinal mucosal cells . By binding to SST2 receptors, somatostatin exerts paracrine inhibitory actions on gastrin release from G cells, histamine release from ECL cells, and directly on parietal cell acid output . The antitumor effects of somatostatin were also effective in various malignant lymphomas and breast tumours ."
1361,"The most common critical NS5A amino acid substitutions that led to reduced susceptibility to daclatasvir therapy occured at position Q30 (Q30H/K/R) and M28 in genotype 1a patients and Y93H in genotype 3 patients. According to 2017 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), 60mg of daclatasvir is recommended with 400mg  for genotype 1a/b patients with or without cirrhosis as second-line therapy. The same dosing regimen can be used as first-line therapy in patients with genotype 3 without cirrhosis and second-line therapy in genotype 3 patients with compensated cirrhosis. The same dosing regimen in treatment-naïve patients with HCV genotype 3 infection with or without cirrhosis achieved SVR12 rates of 71% and 98%, respectively .Daclatasvir is a direct-acting antiviral agent that targets the NS5A and causes a decrease in serum HCV RNA levels. It is shown to have two distinct functions in HCV RNA replication based on phosphorylated states."
1362,"An intravenous solution of hydroxyethyl starch is used to prevent shock following severe blood loss caused by trauma, surgery, or other issues.Hydroxyethyl starch (HES/HAES) is a nonionic starch derivative. Hydroxyethyl starches (HES) are synthetic colloids commonly used for fluid resuscitation to replace intravascular volume. HES is a general term and can be sub-classified according to average molecular weight, molar substitution, concentration, C2/C6 ratio and Maximum Daily Dose.After isovolemic exchange of blood with 500 mL of HES in healthy volunteers, blood volume is maintained for at least 6 hoursHydroxyethyl starch (HES) is one of the most frequently used plasma substitutes. Recent studies have indicated that HES may reduce capillary leakage."
1363,"Eslicarbazepine's mechanism of action is not well understood, but it is known that it does exert anticonvulsant activity by inhibiting repeated neuronal firing and stabilizing the inactivated state of voltage-gated sodium channels, thus preventing their return to the activated state during which seizure activity can occur. Eslicarbazepine acetate is marketed as Aptiom in North America and Zebinix or Exalief in Europe. It is available in 200, 400, 600, or 800mg tablets that are taken once daily, with or without food. It is recommended that patients taking eslicarbazepine acetate be monitored for suicidality.Eslicarbazepine acetate is associated with a dose- and concentration-dependant increase in heart rate and prolongation of PR interval.Eslicarbazepine acetate is converted to the active metabolite eslicarbazepine which carries out its anticonvulsant activity. In in vitro electrophysiological studies, eslicarbazepine was shown to inhibit repeated neuronal firing by stabilizing the inactivated state of voltage-gated sodium channels and preventing their return to the activated state."
1364,"Aurothioglucose is indicated for the adjunctive treatment of early active adult and juvenile type rheumatoid arthritis that is not adequately controlled by other anti-inflammatory agents and conservative measures like salicylate, glucocorticoids, etc. In chronic, advanced cases of rheumatoid arthritis, such gold therapy is not demonstrated to be as valuable . Antirheumatic measures such as salicylate and other anti-inflammatory drugs (both steroidal and non steroidal) may be continued after initiation of gold therapy . Many if not most gold compounds that were indicated for rheumatoid arthritis therapy have since been replaced with the use of various current disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) like methotrexate and others, which are far more effective.After administration, patient serum levels of gold rise sharply but decline over the following week . These attacks are facilitated by various pro-inflammatory immune cells and agents like cytokines, histamines, mast cells, macrophages, monocytes, lymphocytes, leukocytes, and many others ."
1365,"Peginterferon beta-1a is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of MS, including relapsing-remitting disease, clinically isolated syndrome, and active progressive secondary disease.Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic and inflammatory autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, disrupting communication between the brain and other parts of the body. Symptoms may include but are not limited to fatigue, gait changes, bowel or bladder dysfunction, abnormal muscle twitching, vision disturbance, and depressing or mood swings. Currently, it is the only approved pegylated interferon for the management of MS with an proven ability to reduce relapses and delay the progression of disability resulting from MS.Peginterferon beta-1a likely reduces MS relapses and the progression of disability and brain lesions associated with MS by reducing inflammation. The mechanism by which peginterferon beta-1a exerts its effects in patients with multiple sclerosis is unknown, however, it likely exerts its therapeutic actions by reducing inflammation. Through the binding of IFN-beta to its receptor, a cascade of transcriptional events occur, decreasing the inflammation that normally results in the progression of MS."
1366,"For the treatment of prepubertal cryptorchidism (not due to anatomical obstruction), for the treatment of selected cases of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (hypogonadism secondary to a pituitary deficiency) in males and for the induction of ovulation and pregnancy in the anovulatory, infertile woman in whom the cause of anovulation is secondary and not due to primary ovarian failure, and who has been appropriately pretreated with human menotropins.Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), a polypeptide hormone produced by the human placenta. Endogenously produced HCG interacts with the LHCG receptor of the ovary and promotes the maintenance of the corpus luteum during the beginning of pregnancy. This allows the corpus luteum to continuously secrete the hormone progesterone during the first trimester, which is required for maintenance of the uterus and prevents menstruation. The alpha sub-unit is essentially identical to the alpha sub­ units of the human pituitary gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), as well as to the alpha sub-unit of human thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), while the beta sub­ units of these hormones differ in amino acid sequence. It stimulates production of gonadal steroid hormones by stimulating the interstitial cells (Leydig cells) of the testis to produce androgens and the corpus luteum of the ovary to produce progesterone."
1367,"Brexpiprazole is also indicated for the treatment of agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease; however, it is not indicated as an as-needed (“prn”) treatment for this condition.Brexpiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic and a novel D2 dopamine and serotonin 1A partial agonist called serotonin-dopamine activity modulator (SDAM). Currently approved for the treatment of depression, schizophrenia, and agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease, brexpiprazole has also been investigated in other psychiatric disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder.Brexpiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic agent used to ameliorate the symptoms of psychiatric conditions, such as cognitive deficits and affective symptoms. Brexpiprazole acts as a partial agonist at the 5-HT1A, D2, and D3 receptors and as an antagonist at 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT7, α1A, α1B, α1D, and α2C receptors. Brexpiprazole also exhibits affinity for histamine H1 receptor (19 nM) and for muscarinic M1 receptor (67% inhibition at 10 µM).Although the exact mechanism of action of brexpiprazole in psychiatric disorders has not been fully elucidated, the efficacy of brexpiprazole may be attributed to combined partial agonist activity at 5-HT1A and dopamine D2 receptors, and antagonist activity at 5-HT2A receptors. Antagonism at α-adrenergic receptors has also been implicated in schizophrenia and depression."
1368,"Conray is indicated for use in excretory urography, cerebral angiography, peripheral arteriography, venography, arthrography, direct cholangiography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, contrast enhancement of computed tomographic brain images, cranial computerized angiotomography, intravenous digital subtraction angiography and arterial digital subtraction angiography.

1374,"Iopromide, as the product IOVIST, is approved by the FDA for use as an intra-arterial or intravenous X-ray contrast agent. Although iopromide can cause several serious adverse effects, including cardiac events, thromboembolism, hypersensitivity reaction, and even death if administered intrathecally inadvertently, it is still deemed to have a favorable safety profile, with only 0.7% of patients in a 2 years study experiencing adverse events. Although the mechanism is unclear, women and outpatients tend to have a higher incidence of adverse events compared to other population groups. Approved by the FDA in 1995 and Health Canada in 1994 under the brand name ULTRAVIST, iopromide is used in radiological diagnosis, including, but not limited to, intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (IA-DSA), cerebral and peripheral arteriography, peripheral venography, excretory urography, brain computer tomography (CT), coronary arteriography, left ventriculography, visceral angiography, and orthography.After intravenous injection, opacification of the renal parenchyma begins within 1 minute.

1375,"It is an agonist at GABA-A receptors and possesses amnesic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, hypnotic, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. Initially introduced in 1983 in Japan as treatment for neurological conditions such as anxiety and sleep disorders, etizolam is marketed in Japan, Italy and India. It acts on the benzodiazepine site of the GABA-A receptor as an agonist to increase inhibitory GABAergic transmission throughout the central nervous system. It is shown to inhibit PAF-induced bronchoconstriction and hypotension .Etizolam is selectively a full agonist at GABA-A receptors to increase GABAergic transmission and enhance GABA-induced Cl- currents . Benzodiazapines are reported to only bind to receptors that contain gamma 2 and alpha 1/2/3/5 subunits ."
1376,"Indicated in the treatment of symptoms of depressive illness, especially where an anti-anxiety effect is required.Dosulepin (INN, BAN) formerly known as dothiepin (USAN), is a tricyclic antidepressant with anxiolytic properties that is used in several European and South Asian countries, as well as Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand. The metabolites of dosulepin are shown to inhibit 5HT uptake by the human blood platelet .By binding to noradrenaline transporter (NAT) and serotonin transporter (SERT) in an equipotent manner and inhibiting the reuptake activity, dosulepin increases the free levels of noradrenaline and 5HT at the synaptic cleft. It is shown that the main metabolite northiaden is a more potent inhibitor of noradrenaline uptake than the parent drug . Dosulepin binds to 5HT1A and 5HT2A receptors in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus as an antagonist. Main metabolites northiaden, dothiepin sulphoxide and northiaden sulphoxide may also bind to 5HT, α2 and H1 receptors, although with less affinity compared to the parent drug ."
1377,"Dasabuvir is indicated for the treatment of patients with HCV genotype 1a with  or genotype 1b without  including those with compensated cirrhosis .Dasabuvir is a direct acting antiviral medication used as part of combination therapy to treat chronic Hepatitis C, an infectious liver disease caused by infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). Dasabuvir is a non-nucleoside NS5B inhibitor which binds to the palm domain of NS5B and induces a conformational change which renders the polymerase unable to elongate viral RNA . Based on drug resistance mapping studies of HCV genotypes 1a and 1b, dasabuvir targets the palm domain of the NS5B polymerase, and is therefore referred to as a non-nucleoside NS5B-palm polymerase inhibitor. By binding to NS5b outside of the active site of the enzyme, dasabuvir induces a conformational change thereby preventing further elongation of the nascent viral genome . A limitation of binding outside of the active site is that these binding sites are poorly preserved across the viral genotypes."
1378,"For decades, an immediate-release formulation of viloxazine has been used in Europe as an antidepressant. In April 2021, an extended-release formulation of viloxazine under the brand name QELBREE was approved by the FDA for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).Viloxazine is a serotonin-norepinephrine modulating agent that has been used as a treatment for depression and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). There is conflicting evidence in the literature that viloxazine increases dopamine levels in the brain via direct or indirect effects. For example, the norepinephrine transporter is also involved in the reuptake of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex  and stimulation of 5-HT2C receptors facilitates DA release and enhances dopaminergic transmission in the brain. As dopamine dysregulation in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala is implicated in ADHD pathophysiology, the impact of viloxazine on dopamine levels may contribute to its mechanism of action."
1379,"Nisoxetine is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) developed in the 1970s. It was originally investigated as an antidepressant but has no current clinical applications aside from being a research standard SNRI. It has been used to research obesity and energy balance, and exerts some local analgesia effects."
1380,"Lortalamine (LM-1404) is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor developed in the 1980s. This drug never made it past clinical trials, likely due to ocular toxicity in animals, but has been used in positron emission tomography studies to label norepinephrine transporters."

1382,"Developed by Takeda Pharmaceuticals in the early 1980s, it is considered the prototypical compound for the thiazolidinedione class. Ciglitazone was never used as a medication, but it sparked interest in the effects of thiazolidinediones. Several analogues were later developed, some of which—such as pioglitazone and troglitazone—made it to the market. Ciglitazone significantly decreases VEGF production by human granulosa cells in an in vitro study, and may potentially be used in ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.

1417,"Tianeptine is effective in reducing depressive symptoms in mild to severe major depressive disorder and also alleviates anxious symptoms associated with depression without the need for coadministration of an anti-anxiety medication . It is believed that the clinical effects of tianeptine are owed to its modulation of these receptors  . In addition to its actions on the opioid receptor, previous studies have owed its action to its effect on the serotonin receptor , , dopamine (D2/3) receptors , and glutamate receptors , , as discussed below:    Tianeptine has challenged the monoaminergic hypothesis of depression, as well as the widely supported monoaminergic mechanisms whereby the action of most known antidepressants have been explained . In rodents, the stress of acute restraint increases extracellular levels of glutamate in the basolateral amygdala an effect that was inhibited by tianeptine . These data demonstrate that the mechanism of action of tianeptine is distinct from SSRIs and support the hypothesis that the mechanism of action of tianeptine relates to alteration of glutaminergic activity in the amygdala and the hippocampus ."

It is a human monoclonal antibody part of the family of the PCSK9 inhibitors which are a novel class of anticholesterol therapeutics. From this family, it was the first agent to receive FDA approval. PCSK9 inhibition facilitates more LDL-C clearance from the blood.Alirocumab reduces levels of PCSK9 in a concentration-dependent manner. Therefore by inhibiting PCSK9's actions, alirocumab allows for more LDL-C reuptake by the liver and facilitates a higher rate of clearance."
1424,"In addition, it is indicated adjunctly to other hypolipidemic treatments in patients ≥10 years old with homozygous familiar hypercholesterolemia to reduce LDL-C.Evolocumab is a monoclonal antibody designed for the treatment of hyperlipidemia by Amgen. PCSK9 is a protein that targets LDL receptors for degradation, therefore reducing the liver's ability to remove LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), or ""bad"" cholesterol, from the blood. Individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia often may have ""gain of function"" mutations in the PCSK9 molecules in their body, resulting in increased LDL-C plasma levels and a consequent cardiovascular risk. The mAb1 molecule binds on the catalytic site of PCSK9 next to the binding site for the LDL receptor and creates hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, resulting in the steric inhibition of binding between PCSK9 and the LDL receptor. Because the formation of complexes between LDL receptor and PCSK9 are prevented, the internalized LDL receptors are less likely to be degrated by lysosomes and may recycle to the surface of the cell to serve their function of removing LDL from the blood."

It has a long duration of action as it is given once daily, and a wide therapeutic window.Genetic mutations or natural misfolding of transthyretin destabalizes transthyretin tetramers, leading to their dissociation and aggregation in tissues, and disrupting the normal function of these tissues. Tafamidis binds to transthyretin tetramers at the thyroxin binding sites, stabilizing the tetramer, reducing the availability of monomers for amyloidogenesis."
1493,"Selumetinib is indicated for the treatment of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) in patients two years and older who have symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas (PN).Activation of the Raf-MEK-ERK signalling pathway is known to be implemented in several types of malignancies; thus, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors such as selumetinib are important tools that can target the problematic overactivity of this pathway. However, selumetinib demonstrated impressive efficacy and tolerability in Phase I trials, leading to its continued investigation for the treatment of various types of tumours in Phase II trials. Some patients with this disorder develop plexiform neurofibromas (PN); however, this is considered relatively uncommon compared to other variants of NF-1. By selectively targeting MEK1 and MEK2, selumetinib is able to inhibit oncogenic downstream effects of the Raf-MEK-ERK signaling pathway, which is often overactive in certain types of cancer. ERK is then able to exert its effects on several downstream targets."

1502,"Duvelisib is indicated for the treatment of relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) in adult patients who have trialed at least two prior therapies.Duvelisib, also known as IPI-145 and INK-1197, is a small-molecule inhibitor of phosphoinositide-3 kinases that was designed initially to prove that simultaneous inhibition of the isoforms delta and gamma can produce a broad adaptative and innate immune cell inhibitory activity. All the work around duvelisib showed that this agent is a potent inhibitor of both forms. This trials reported a median progression-free survival of 16.4 months and an overall response rate of 78% which were almost 2-fold what it was reported for ofatumumab. Hence, inhibition of PI3K can provide an inhibition of the signaling from BCR, inhibition of a cytokine signaling from the microenvironment and enhancement of anti-tumor immunity. In summary, duvelisib inhibits the isoform delta of PI3K which is necessary for cell proliferation and survival and the isoform gamma which is critical for cytokine signaling and the pro-inflammatory response."

By targeting the genetically-mutated cancer cells that lack a DNA repair mechanism, rucaparib causes cancer cell death and reduces tumour growth. Rucaparib decreases tumour growth in tumour cell lines with deficiencies in BRCA1/2 and other DNA repair genes. Rucaparib can also cause vasodilation, which may increase tumour perfusion and enhance the accumulation of cytotoxic drugs in cancer cells.PARPs play a role in DNA repair by activating DNA damage response pathways, such as base excision repair, and facilitating DNA repair. HR DNA repair pathways repair double-strand breaks; however, HR-deficient cancer cells lack this repair mechanism."

1513,"The primary therapeutic use for which benserazide is currently indicated for is as a combination therapy with levadopa for the treatment of Parkinson's disease in adults > 25 years of age, with the exception of drug-induced parkinsonism . Although studies are ongoing, no evidence has been formally elucidated as of yet .When levodopa is used by itself as a therapy for treating Parkinson's disease, its ubiquitous metabolism into dopamine is responsible for a resultant increase in the levels of circulating dopamine in the blood and to various extracerebral tissues. Unfortunately, the resultant increase in the levels of circulating dopamine in the blood and to various extracerebral tissues can result in a number of side effects like nausea, vomiting, or even cardiac arrhythmias that may diminish patient adherence . A decarboxylase inhibitor like benserazide is consequently an effective compound to combine with levadopa as it is incapable of crossing the blood-brain barrier itself and therefore allows levadopa to elicit its primary action in the central nervous system, but will prevent the formation of dopamine from levadopa in extracerebral tissues - thereby acting to minimize the occurrence of extracerebral side effects .The combination of levodopa and benserazide is an anti-Parkinsonian agent . It is important to note, however, that benserazide is hydroxylated to trihydroxybenzylhydrazine in the intestinal mucosa and the liver , and that as a potent inhibitor of the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase , it is this trihydroxybenzylhydrazine metabolite of benserazide that mainly protects levodopa against decarboxylation to dopamine in the gut and also around the rest of the body outside of the blood-brain barrier .Finally, it is also proposed that benserazide hydrochloride may be able to treat beta thalassaemia by maintaining the active expression of the gene for fetal hemoglobin so that constant production of fetal hemoglobin may replace the missing adult hemoglobin variation that is characteristic of patients with the condition, thereby decreasing the need for blood transfusion therapy ."
1514,"Etelcalcetide is a calcium-sensing receptor agonist indicated for:   Secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis.Etelcalcetide is a calcimimetic drug for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Etelcalcetide was approved (trade name Parsabiv) for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis in February, 2017.Following a single intravenous bolus administration of etelcalcetide, PTH levels decreased within 30 minutes post dose. In the single-dose study, the extent and duration of the reduction in PTH increased with increasing dose. Reduction in PTH levels correlated with plasma etelcalcetide concentrations in hemodialysis patients. The reduction in PTH resulted in reductions in calcium and attenuation of post-dialytic phosphate elevation."
1515,"Additionally, quizartinib also demonstrates inhibitory activity toward FLT3 with internal tandem duplication (ITD), although with a 10-fold lower affinity compared to wild-type FLT3. Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated quizartinib's efficacy in relapsed/refractory FLT3-ITD mutant AML. In AML patients receiving quizartinib at a dose of 90 mg/day for females and 135 mg/day for males on a 28-day schedule, the median levels of phospho-FLT3 (pFLT3) and total FLT3 (tFLT3) decreased from 3312 RLU or 5639 RLU respectively at day 1 to 1235 RLU and 142 RLU respectively at day 8. Quizartinib is a small molecule inhibitor of the receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3.

1518,"Tiapride is indicated for the treatment of a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders including dyskinesia, alcohol withdrawal syndrome, negative symptoms of psychosis, and agitation and aggression in the elderly.Tiapride is a selective D2 and D3 dopamine receptor blocker in the brain.Tiapride has a high degree of regional selectivity for limbic areas. One study found that tiapride shows over three times as much affinity for limbic areas than striatal areas as opposed to the near equal selectivity for limbic and striatal regions shown by haloperidol. Another study in rats found tiapride's affinity for the septum, a limbic region, to be over thirty times as high as for the striatum. Efficacy at the D2 receptor is moderate, with 80 percent of receptors occupied even in the presence of excess tiapride concentrations.Tiapride is a selective dopamine D2 and D3 receptor antagonist, offering an advantage over other neuroleptic drugs, such as haloperidol and risperidone, which bind a range of targets including four of the five known dopamine receptor subtypes (D1-4), serotonin (5-HT2A, 2C), α1- and α2-adrenergic, and histamine H1 receptors.

1520,"Indicated for the management of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, also known as chronic obstructive lung disease) and asthma.Levosalbutamol, or levalbuterol, is a short-acting β2 adrenergic receptor agonist used in the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). has been marketed as a racemic mixture, although beta2-agonist activity resides almost exclusively in the (R)-enantiomer. The enantioselective disposition of salbutamol and the possibility that (S)-salbutamol has adverse effects have led to the development of an enantiomerically pure (R)-salbutamol formulation known as levosalbutamol (levalbuterol).It acts by relaxing smooth muscle in the bronchial tubes to increase air flow and relieve acute shortness of breath.β2 adrenergic receptors on airway smooth muscle are Gs coupled and their activation by levosalbutamol leads to activation of adenylate cyclase and to an increase in the intracellular concentration of 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP activates protein kinase A which itself inhibits the phosphorylation of myosin produces lower intracellular ionic calcium concentrations, inducing muscle relaxation. Increased cyclic AMP concentrations are also associated with the inhibition of the release of mediators from mast cells in the airways, potentially contributing to its benefit in asthma attacks."
1521,"Used in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, oesophygeal cancer, and head and neck cancers .Nedaplatin is a second generation platinum analog . It also binds to purine nucleotides in the DNA. The active form allows for two binding interactions to form cross-links between these nucleotides. The mismatch repair (MMR) protein complex also recognizes the distortion caused by platinum complexes and attempts to repair the DNA. This results in single strand breaks when the MMR complex attempts to remove the platinum cross-link."
1522,"In dermatology, topical clobestasone butyrate helps to reduce the itchiness and erythema associated with eczema and dermatitis. In ophthalmology, clobetasone butyrate 0.1% eye drops have been shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of dry eyes in Sjögren's Syndrome.Clobetasone is a corticosteroid that is often employed topically as a treatment for a variety of conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, various forms of dermatitis, and also for certain ophthalmologic conditions. Topical clobetasone butyrate has shown minimal suppression of the Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.Topical corticosteroid like clobetasone are synthetic derivatives of cortisone which produce anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, immunosuppressive and vasoconstrictor effects when applied to the skin.Topically applied clobeyasone are thought to bind with cytoplasmic receptors in the dermal and intradermal cells and to induce inhibitory proteins, thus leading to decreased activity of prostaglandins, kinins, histamine, liposomal enzymes and other endogenous mediators of inflammation. Topical corticosteroids inhibit the migration of macrophages and leukocytes into areas of inflamed skin by reversing vascular dilation and permeability, resulting in decreased erythema, edema and pruritus."

Moroctocog alfa is identical in sequence to endogenously produced Factor VIII, but does not contain the B-domain, which has no known biological function. Congenital loss or deficiency of Factor VIII results in the physiologic impairment of the coagulation clotting cascade, and as a result, leads to easy bruising and bleeding. Use of recombinant DNA-derived clotting factor treatments, such as Moroctocog alfa, has reduced this risk. Moroctocog alfa is approved by Health Canada and by the European Medicines Agency for the control and prevention of hemorrhagic episodes and for routine and surgical prophylaxis in patients with hemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency or classic hemophilia). As factor VIII is the specific clotting factor deficient in patients with hemophilia A, replacement of clotting factor with Moroctocog alfa, also known as BDDrFVIII (B domain deleted recombinant factor VIII), is the cornerstone of the prevention and treatment of bleeding for this disorder."
1594,"Alpha-tocopherol acetate is subsequently most commonly indicated for dietary supplementation in individuals who may demonstrate a genuine deficiency in vitamin E. Vitamin E itself is naturally found in various foods, added to others, or used in commercially available products as a dietary supplement. Although all forms of Vitamin E exhibit antioxidant activity, it is known that the antioxidant activity of vitamin E is not sufficient to explain the vitamin's biological activity. GPIIb/IIIa is the major membrane receptor protein that is key to the role of the platelet aggregation response. Alpha-tocopherol downregulates GPIIb promoter activity which results in reduction of GPIIb protein expression and decreased platelet aggregation. Lastly, the mechanism of action of vitamin E's antiviral effects (primarily against HIV-1) involves its antioxidant activity."

1601,"An intermediate in the metabolism of DIAZEPAM to OXAZEPAM. It may have actions similar to those of diazepam.Nordazepam (INN; marketed under brand names Nordaz, Stilny, Madar, Vegesan, and Calmday; also known as nordiazepam, desoxydemoxepam, and desmethyldiazepam) is a 1,4-benzodiazepine derivative. Like other benzodiazepine derivatives, it has amnesic, anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, and sedative properties. However, it is used primarily in the treatment of anxiety disorders. It is an active metabolite of diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, clorazepate, prazepam, pinazepam, and medazepam.Nordazepam is among the longest lasting (longest half-life) benzodiazepines, and its occurrence as a metabolite is responsible for most cumulative side-effects of its myriad of pro-drugs when they are used repeatedly at moderate-high doses; the nordazepam metabolite oxazepam is also active (and is a more potent, full BZD-site agonist), which contributes to nordazepam cumulative side-effects but occur too minutely to contribute to the cumulative side-effects of nordazepam pro-drugs (except when they are abused chronically in extremely supra-therapeutic doses)."
1602,"Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is a potassium binder indicated for the treatment of hyperkalemia in adult patients.Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is approved as the trade product Lokelma developed by AstraZeneca - an insoluble, non-absorbed sodium zirconium silicate, formulated as a powder for oral suspension that acts as a highly selective potassium removing agent. The treatment effect was maintained for up to 12 months.Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is capable of reducing serum potassium concentrations as quickly as one hour after ingestion and normokalaemia can be achieved typically within 24 to 48 hours. As a consequence of the resultant reduction in serum potassium concentration, there is a reduction in urinary potassium excretion as well. In a study of healthy subjects given sodium zirconium cyclosilicate 5 or 10 grams daily for four days, a dose-dependent reduction in serum potassium concentration and total urinary potassium excretion were accompanied by mean increases in fecal potassium excretion. Moreover, mean reductions in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were observed in the 5 g (-1.1 mg/dL) and 10 g (-2.0 mg/dL) three times daily groups compared with small mean increases in the placebo (0.8 mg/dL) and low dose sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (0.3 mg/dL).Hyperkalemia is a condition defined by elevated potassium levels in the blood, often caused by cardiovascular, renal, and metabolic diseases."

1605,"D2 receptors have been the most common target for antipsychotic agents used in the treatment of schizophrenia: the positive symptoms are thought to arise from overactivity in the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway activating D2 receptors, whereas  negative symptoms may result from a decreased activity in the mesocortical dopaminergic pathway with D1 receptors predominating . In a randomized, double-blind clinical trial, treatment of aripiprazole lauroxil in adult patients with schizophrenia resulted in improvement of positive and negative symptoms scores at day 85 of treatment . In contrast, aripiprazole is thought to act as a functional agonist in the mesocortical pathway, where reduced dopamine activity is seen in association with negative symptoms and cognitive impairment . Antagonism at 5-HT2A receptors by aripiprazole alleviates the negative symptoms and cognitive impairment of schizophrenia . Aripiprazole is a partial agonist at theses receptors and reduces 5-HT release; this results in potentiated dopamine release in the striatum and prefrontal cortex ."

1628,"Imlifidase is indicated for desensitization of highly sensitized adult kidney transplant patients with a positive crossmatch against an available deceased donor. The treatment is reserved for patients unlikely to receive a transplant under the available kidney allocation system including prioritization programs for highly sensitized patients.Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive and irreversible disease that represents a significant burden for both the individual and healthcare system at large. Highly sensitized individuals carry high levels of anti-HLA antibodies and are at significant risk for antibody-mediated rejection which occurs mainly through complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Imlifidase is a cysteine protease and eliminates Fc-dependent effector functions such as CDC and ADCC by cleaving the heavy chains of human immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. As a result, the risk of antibody-mediated rejection is reduced allowing kidney transplantation in highly sensitized patients to proceed.Imlifidase is highly specific to all four human IgG subclasses and does not cleave any other immunoglobulins (IgM, IgA, IgE, IgD)."
1629,"Vericiguat is indicated in adults with symptomatic, chronic heart failure and an ejection fraction of <45% to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and heart failure-related hospitalization following a hospitalization for heart failure or need for outpatient intravenous diuretics.Vericiguat is a direct stimulator of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) used in the management of systolic heart failure to reduce mortality and hospitalizations. A key component of the NO-sGC-cGMP signaling pathway that helps to regulate the cardiovascular system, sGC enzymes are intracellular enzymes found in vascular smooth muscle cells (amongst other cell types) that catalyze the synthesis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in response to activation by nitric oxide (NO). As a direct stimulator of sGC, vericiguat mitigates the need for a functional NO-sGC-cGMP axis and thereby helps to prevent the myocardial and vascular dysfunction associated with decreased sGC activity in heart failure. Although not the first sGC stimulator to be granted FDA approval ( was approved in 2013 for use in pulmonary hypertension), vericiguat is unique amongst its peers in that modifications to its structure have dramatically decreased its susceptibility to oxidative metabolism, resulting in a relatively long half-life and allowing for once-daily dosing.By directly stimulating the increased production of intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), vericiguat causes the relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and vasodilation. Animal reproduction studies have demonstrated the potential for embryo-fetal toxicity when vericiguat is administered to pregnant females - defects in major vessel and heart formation, as well as spontaneous abortions/resorptions, were observed when vericiguat was administered to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis."
1630,"Sotorasib is indicated in the treatment of KRAS G12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in adults who have received at least one prior systemic therapy.Sotorasib, also known as AMG-510, is an acrylamide-derived KRAS inhibitor developed by Amgen. Mutant KRAS discovered in 1982 but was not considered a druggable target until the mid-2010s. Patients should be counselled regarding the risks of hepatotoxicity, interstitial lung disease and pneumonitis; and to avoid breastfeeding during treatment and up to 1 week after the last dose.Normally GTP binds to KRAS, activating the protein and promoting effectors to the MAP kinase pathway. Sotorasib binds to the cysteine residue in KRAS G12C mutations, holding the protein in its inactive form. This mutation is present in 13% of non small cell lung cancer, 3% of colorectal and appendix cancer, and 1-3% of solid tumors."
1631,"In February 2023, pegcetacoplan for intravitreal use was approved by the FDA for the treatment of geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration.Pegcetacoplan is a complement C3 inhibitor that prevents complement-mediated hemolysis of red blood cells in patients with paroxysomal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. In patients with PNH, complement inhibiting cell surface proteins, such as CD55 and CD59, are not anchored to the surface of red blood cells. C3b proteins can also bind directly to a target cell, marking it as a target for phagocytosis. The MAC is a pore formed in the cell by 16 C9 proteins associated with C5b, C6, C7, and C8. In patients with PNH, extravascular hemolysis is mediated by C3b marking red blood cells for phagocytosis, and intravascular hemolysis is mediated by the MAC."
1632,"Belumosudil is indicated for the treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older following failure of at least two other lines of systemic therapy.Belumosudil is used in the treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and has been investigated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. It is an inhibitor of rho-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinases (ROCK), with significantly more selectivity for ROCK2 as compared to ROCK1 (IC50 100 nM vs. 3 μM, respectively). In the treatment of GVHD, a condition in which donor T-cells begin to attack recipient tissues following allogeneic hematopoeitic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), belumosudil helps to resolve immune dysregulation by shifting the balance between Th17 cells and T-regulatory cells, thereby dampening the inflammatory cascade that can occasionally be fatal. Given its mechanism of action and findings in animal trials, belumosudil is considered to carry embryo-fetal toxicity and may cause significant harm to a developing fetus should a pregnant mother be exposed. Female patients of reproductive potential, or male patients with female partners of reproductive potential, should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment with belumosudil and for one week after the last dose.Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a life-threatening complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in which the transplanted donor T-cells recognize the recipient's tissues as foreign and mount an immune response."
