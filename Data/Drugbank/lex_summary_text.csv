4,DB00006,"For treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and for the prevention of thrombosis. Bivalirudin is indicated for use in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), in patients at moderate to high risk acute coronary syndromes due to unstable angina or non-ST segment elevation in whom a PCI is planned.Bivalirudin is a synthetic 20 residue peptide (thrombin inhibitor) which reversibly inhibits thrombin. Once bound to the active site, thrombin cannot activate fibrinogen into fibrin, the crucial step in the formation of thrombus. Because it can cause blood stagnation, it is important to monitor changes in hematocrit, activated partial thromboplastin time, international normalized ratio and blood pressure.Bivalirudin mediates an inhibitory action on thrombin by directly and specifically binding to both the catalytic site and anion-binding exosite of circulating and clot-bound thrombin. The action of bivalirudin is reversible because thrombin will slowly cleave the thrombin-bivalirudin bond which recovers the active site of thrombin."
5,DB00007,"It is also used for the treatment of pediatric patients with central precocious puberty (CPP).leuprolide is also indicated for the initial treatment of the symptoms of endometriosis.Leuprolide is a synthetic 9-residue peptide analogue of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). As a GnRH mimic, leuprolide is capable of binding to the GnRH receptor (GnRHR) and inducing downstream modulation of both gonadotropin hormone and sex steroid levels. Prolonged activation of GnRHR results in significant downregulation of sex steroid levels, which is primarily responsible for the clinical efficacy of leuprolide in diverse conditions, including advanced prostate cancer, endometriosis, and central precocious puberty. Leuprolide remains frontline therapy in all conditions for which it is indicated for use.Leuprolide is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue that functions as a GnRH receptor superagonist. As a GnRHR agonist, leuprolide binds to and initially activates downstream LH and FSH release; this initial spike in gonadotropin levels is responsible for some of the adverse effects associated with treatment."

The neurotoxin complex is recovered from the fermentation process and purified through a series of precipitation and chromatography steps.Botulinum Toxin Type B inhibits acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction via a three stage process: 1) Heavy Chain mediated neurospecific binding of the toxin, 2) internalization of the toxin by receptor-mediated endocytosis, and 3) ATP and pH dependent translocation of the Light Chain to the neuronal cytosol where it acts as a zinc-dependent endoprotease cleaving polypeptides essential for neurotransmitter release.Botulinum Toxin Type B binds to and cleaves the synaptic Vesicle Associated Membrane Protein (VAMP, also known as synaptobrevin) which is a component of the protein complex responsible for docking and fusion of the synaptic vesicle to the presynaptic membrane, a necessary step to neurotransmitter release."
36,DB00043,"In September 2018, a new prefilled syringe formulation of this drug was approved by the FDA .Omalizumab is a recombinant, humanized, monoclonal antibody against human immunoglobulin E (IgE) which treats the symptoms of asthma and chronic idiopathic urticaria by limiting the allergic response , . It inhibits the binding of IgE to receptors on mast cells and basophils, blocking the IgE-mediated secretion of inflammatory mediators from these cells . Mast cell activation and the release of mediators, in response to allergen exposure and IgE, results in a cascade of events. The following are explanations of the mechanism of action for both indications of this drug:    **Asthma**    Omalizumab inhibits the binding of IgE to the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcÎµRI) on the surface of both mast cells and basophils. Omalizumab binds to free IgE with a higher affinity than IgE itself binds to the high-affinity Fcâ¬RI receptors found on basophils."
37,DB00046,"Insulin is prescribed for the management of diabetes mellitus to mimic the activity of endogenously produced human insulin, a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas that promotes glucose metabolism. Insulin is released from the pancreas following a meal to promote the uptake of glucose from the blood into internal organs and tissues such as the liver, fat cells, and skeletal muscle. Insulin is an important treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels. Due to its duration of action of around 5 hours, Humalog is considered ""bolus insulin"" as it provides high levels of insulin in a short period of time to mimic the release of endogenous insulin from the pancreas after meals. Its activity peaks 60 minutes following subcutaneous injection and its duration of action is 4-5 hours."
38,DB00047,"Insulin is typically prescribed for the management of diabetes mellitus to mimic the activity of endogenously produced human insulin, a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas that promotes glucose metabolism.

This prevents the development of emphysema.Alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor is a serine protease inhibitor (Serpin). Its primary mechanism is inhibiting the action of the serine protease called elastase (also plasmin and thrombin) in the lungs. The reactive center loop (RCL) of alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor extends out from the body of the protein and directs binding to the target protease. The protease cleaves the serpin at the reactive site, establishing a covalent linkage between the carboxyl group of the serpin reactive site and the serine hydroxyl of the protease."

Asparagine is an amino acid that is vital for cell survival. In February 1994, pegaspargase was approved by the FDA for the treatment of ALL in patients with hypersensitivity to native forms of L-asparaginase.Unlike normal cells, leukemia cells are dependent on an exogenous source of asparagine for survival. Pegaspargase hydrolyses asparagine into aspartic acid and ammonia, which depletes asparagine levels and leads to leukaemic cell death. Both _Escherichia coli_-derived L-asparaginase and pegaspargase follow the same mechanism of action; however, _Escherichia coli_-derived L-asparaginase requires frequent administration, presents a high incidence of hypersensitivity reactions, and can be neutralized without any signs of hypersensitivity."

53,DB00067,"Vasopressin is indicated to increase blood pressure in adults in vasodilatory shock refractory to the application of fluids and catecholamines.Vasopressin (arginine-vasopressin or antidiuretic hormone) is a nonapeptide primarily produced in the hypothalamus that exhibits diverse physiological functions related to diuresis, hemodynamic modulation, and behaviour. Vasopressin release is mediated by sensory pathways, in which either a 2% increase in plasma osmolarity or a 10% decrease in blood pressure causes the release of endogenous vasopressin. Vasopressin binding to V1causes hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate into inositol triphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) and diacylglycerol (DAG) by phospholipase C, which in turn release intracellular calcium and activate protein kinase C (PKC) to open voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) while closing potassium channels. It is also thought that vasopressin, acting through both V1 and oxytocin receptors, causes the cardiac release of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), which has a negative inotropic effect; indeed, vasopressin tends to decrease heart rate and cardiac output, although the opposite effect has been noted with low doses. In these cases, vasopressin acts to depolarize hyperpolarized vascular smooth muscle cells, restore sensitivity to catecholamines, and inhibit excessive nitric oxide production, primarily through acting through V1 receptors."

This protein is produced by recombinant DNA technology and resembles interferon secreted by leukocytes. It is used extensively as an antiviral or antineoplastic agent.Upregulates the expression of MHC I proteins, allowing for increased presentation of peptides derived from viral antigens. Interferon alpha also induce the synthesis of several key antiviral mediators, including 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase (2'-5' A synthetase) and protein kinase R.Interferon alpha binds to type I interferon receptors (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2c) which upon dimerization activate two Jak (Janus kinase) tyrosine kinases (Jak1 and Tyk2). Interferon alpha binds less stably to type I interferon receptors than interferon beta."
81,DB00107,"Administration of exogenous oxytocin is indicated in the antepartum period to initiate or improve uterine contractions for vaginal delivery in situations where there is fetal or maternal concern. It should be noted that there are risks associated with oxytocin intervention during childbirth. It plays an important role in pair bonding, social cognition and functioning, and even fear conditioning. The elicited uterine contractions will then stimulate the release of increasing amounts of oxytocin. Since exogenously administered and endogenously secreted oxytocin result in the same effects on the female reproductive system, synthetic oxytocin may be used in specific instances during the antepartum and postpartum period to induce or improve uterine contractions."
82,DB00108,"It is also indicated for inducing and maintaining clinical response and remission in adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohnâs disease with evidence of inflammation who have had an inadequate response to or are unable to tolerate, conventional therapies and inhibitors of TNF-Î±.

There is some evidence that L-phenylalanine may exacerbate tardive dyskinesia in some schizophrenic patients and in some who have used neuroleptic drugs.Phenylalanine is an essential aromatic amino acid that is a precursor of melanin, ,  (norepinephrine), and .Used by the brain to produce Norepinephrine, a chemical that transmits signals between nerve cells and the brain; keeps you awake and alert; reduces hunger pains; functions as an antidepressant and helps improve memory.The supposed antidepressant effects of L-phenylalanine may be due to its role as a precursor in the synthesis of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine. The mechanism of L-phenylalanine's possible antivitiligo activity is not well understood. It is thought that L-phenylalanine may stimulate the production of melanin in the affected skin"
89,DB00122,"Choline is also needed for gallbladder regulation, liver function and lecithin (a key lipid) formation. Phosphatidylcholine's role in the maintenance of cell membrane integrity is vital to all of the basic biological processes: information flow, intracellular communication and bioenergetics. Choline is also a major part of another membrane phospholipid, sphingomyelin, also important for the maintenance of cell structure and function. This appears to be due to abnormalities in cell membrane phosphatidylcholine content and an increase in ceramide, a precursor, as well as a metabolite, of sphingomyelin. Betaine is one of the factors that maintains low levels of homocysteine by resynthesizing L-methionine from homocysteine."
90,DB00126,"It has also been suggested to be an effective antiviral agent.A six carbon compound related to glucose. It is found naturally in citrus fruits and many vegetables. Vitamin C is considered an antioxidant.Ascorbic Acid (vitamin C) is a water-soluble vitamin indicated for the prevention and treatment of scurvy, as ascorbic acid deficiency results in scurvy. Collagenous structures are primarily affected, and lesions develop in bones and blood vessels. Administration of ascorbic acid completely reverses the symptoms of ascorbic acid deficiency.In humans, an exogenous source of ascorbic acid is required for collagen formation and tissue repair by acting as a cofactor in the posttranslational formation of 4-hydroxyproline in -Xaa-Pro-Gly- sequences in collagens and other proteins."

L-glutamine improves nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) redox potential .Supplemental L-glutamine's possible immunomodulatory role may be accounted for in a number of ways. L-glutamine appears to play a major role in protecting the integrity of the gastrointestinal tract and, in particular, the large intestine. The demand for L-glutamine by the intestine, as well as by cells such as lymphocytes, appears to be much greater than that supplied by skeletal muscle, the major storage tissue for L-glutamine. It can lead to an increased synthesis of glutathione in the intestine, which may also play a role in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal mucosa by ameliorating oxidative stress."
92,DB00132,"It is a component of many common vegetable oils and is important to human nutrition.Alpha Linolenic Acid (ALA) is an 18-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acid with three double bonds. It is also called an omega-3 fatty acid, and is essential for all mammals. It is in fact  a plant-derived fatty acid. EPA is a precursor of the series-3 prostaglandins, the series-5 leukotrienes and the series-3 thromboxanes. Omega-3 fatty acids like ALA and its byproducts can modulate the expression of a number of genes, including those involved with fatty acid metabolism and inflammation."
93,DB00134,"Used for protein synthesis including the formation of SAMe, L-homocysteine, L-cysteine, taurine, and sulfate.A sulfur containing essential amino acid that is important in many body functions. L-methionine is a precursor to L-cysteine. L-cysteine itself may have antioxidant activity. Antioxidant activity of L-methionine and metabolites of L-methionine appear to account for its possible anti-hepatotoxic activity. Recent research suggests that methionine itself has free-radical scavenging activity by virtue of its sulfur, as well as its chelating ability."
94,DB00135,"Tyrosine is claimed to act as an effective antidepressant, however results are mixed. It is also the precursor of , thyroid hormones, and melanin.Tyrosine is a nonessential amino acid synthesized in the body from phenylalanine. It may improve memory and increase mental alertness. Half of the phenylalanine required goes into the production of tyrosine; if the diet is rich in tyrosine itself, the requirements for phenylalanine are reduced by about 50%. The mechanism of L-tyrosine's antidepressant activity can be accounted for by the precursor role of L-tyrosine in the synthesis of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine."
95,DB00136,"Also used in conjunction with calcium in the management and prevention of primary or corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis.Calcitriol is an active metabolite of vitamin D with 3 hydroxyl (OH) groups and is commonly referred to as 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, or 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub>. Various studies demonstrated expression of vitamin D receptors in cancer cell lines, including mouse myeloid leukemia cells . Vitamin D appears to demonstrate both immune-enhancing and immunosuppressive effects.The mechanism of action of calcitriol in the treatment of psoriasis is accounted for by their antiproliferative activity for keratinocytes and their stimulation of epidermal cell differentiation. The anticarcinogenic activity of the active form of Calcitriol appears to be correlated with cellular vitamin D receptor (VDR) levels. The immunomodulatory activity of calcitriol is thought to be mediated by vitamin D receptors (VDRs) which are expressed constitutively in monocytes but induced upon activation of T and B lymphocytes."
96,DB00139,"For nutritional supplementation, also for treating dietary shortage or imbalanceA water-soluble, colorless crystal with an acid taste that is used as a chemical intermediate, in medicine, the manufacture of lacquers, and to make perfume esters. It also has been shown to be a good ""natural"" antibiotic because of its relative acidic or caustic nature (high concentrations can even cause burns). Succinate supplements have been shown to help reduce the effects of hangovers by activating the degradation of acetaldehyde - a toxic byproduct of alcohol metabolism - into CO2 and H2O through aerobic metabolism. Succinic acid has been shown to stimulate neural system recovery and bolster the immune system. Claims have also been made that it boosts awareness, concentration and reflexes."
97,DB00140,"For the treatment of ariboflavinosis (vitamin B2 deficiency).Nutritional factor found in milk, eggs, malted barley, liver, kidney, heart, and leafy vegetables. The richest natural source is yeast. Riboflavin is the precursor of flavin mononucleotide (FMN, riboflavin monophosphate) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). The antioxidant activity of riboflavin is principally derived from its role as a precursor of FAD and the role of this cofactor in the production of the antioxidant reduced glutathione. Reduced glutathione is the cofactor of the selenium-containing glutathione peroxidases among other things."
98,DB00142,"Considered to be nature's ""Brain food"" by improving mental capacities; helps speed the healing of ulcers; gives a ""lift"" from fatigue; helps control alcoholism, schizophrenia and the craving for sugar.A peptide that is a homopolymer of glutamic acid.In addition to being one of the building blocks in protein synthesis, it is the most widespread neurotransmitter in brain function, as an excitatory neurotransmitter and as a precursor for the synthesis of GABA in GABAergic neurons. Glutamate activates both ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors. The ionotropic ones being non-NMDA (AMPA and kainate) and NMDA receptors. Free glutamic acid cannot cross the blood-brain barrier in appreciable quantities; instead it is converted into L-glutamine, which the brain uses for fuel and protein synthesis. It is conjectured that glutamate is involved in cognitive functions like learning and memory in the brain, though excessive amounts may cause neuronal damage associated in diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, lathyrism, and Alzheimer's disease."
99,DB00145,"It is found primarily in gelatin and silk fibroin and used therapeutically as a nutrient. It is also a fast inhibitory neurotransmitter.Helps trigger the release of oxygen to the energy requiring cell-making process; Important in the manufacturing of hormones responsible for a strong immune system.In the CNS, there exist strychnine-sensitive glycine binding sites as well as strychnine-insensitive glycine binding sites. The strychnine-sensitive glycine receptor complex is comprised of a chloride channel and is a member of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily. The putative antispastic activity of supplemental glycine could be mediated by glycine's binding to strychnine-sensitive binding sites in the spinal cord. This would result in increased chloride conductance and consequent enhancement of inhibitory neurotransmission."
100,DB00146,"It is effective in the treatment of rickets and osteomalacia, both in azotemic and non-azotemic patients. Vitamin D3 is a steroid hormone that has long been known for its important role in regulating body levels of calcium and phosphorus, in mineralization of bone, and for the assimilation of vitamin A. It promotes renal reabsorption of calcium, increases intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus, and increases calcium and phosphorus mobilization from bone to plasma.Calcidiol is transformed in the kidney by 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-1-(alpha)-hydroxylase to calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D3. Calcitriol binds to intracellular receptors that then function as transcription factors to modulate gene expression. Calcitriol appears to promote intestinal absorption of calcium through binding to the vitamin D receptor in the mucosal cytoplasm of the intestine."
101,DB00150,"It is also essential for the production of niacin, the synthesis of the neurotransmitter serotonin and melatonin. Tryptophan supplements can be used as natural relaxants to help relieve insomnia. Tryptophan also appears to help the immune system and can reduce the risk of cardiac spasms. Tryptopan serves as the precursor for the synthesis of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) and melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine).A number of important side reactions occur during the catabolism of tryptophan on the pathway to acetoacetate. Kynurenine is the first key branch point intermediate in the pathway."
102,DB00152,"For the treatment of thiamine and niacin deficiency states, Korsakov's alcoholic psychosis, Wernicke-Korsakov syndrome, delirium, and peripheral neuritis.Thiamine or thiamin, also known as vitamin B1, is a colorless compound with the chemical formula C12H17N4OS. Thiamine plays a key role in intracellular glucose metabolism and it is thought that thiamine inhibits the effect of glucose and insulin on arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation. The neuronal death is associated with increased free radical production, suggesting that oxidative stress may play an important early role in brain damage associated with thiamine deficiency. Thiamine plays a key role in intracellular glucose metabolism and it is thought that thiamine inhibits the effect of glucose and insulin on arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation. Thiamine has been shown to inhibit this effect of glucose on endothelial cells.It is thought that the mechanism of action of thiamine on endothelial cells is related to a reduction in intracellular protein glycation by redirecting the glycolytic flux."
103,DB00153,"Rickets is a condition produced due to a deficiency in vitamin D, calcium or phosphorus. Ergocalciferol was isolated for the first time from yeast in 1931 and its structure was elucidated in 1932. When compared to its vitamin D counterpart , ergocalciferol has been shown to present a reduced induction of calcidiol and hence, it is less potent. Ergocalciferol supplementation in patients with end-stage renal disease has been shown to generate a significant benefit in lab parameters of bone and mineral metabolism as well as improvement in glycemic control, serum albumin levels and reduced levels of inflammatory markers.For its activity, ergocalciferol is required to be transformed to its major active circulating hydroxylated metabolite and transported to the target organs in order to bind to its target, the vitamin D receptor. The activation of the vitamin D receptor is part of the vitamin D endocrine system and it is described by the production of a change in the transcription rates of the vitamin D receptor target genes."
104,DB00158,"Folic acid is indicated for the treatment of folic acid deficiency, megaloblastic anemia, and in anemias of nutritional origins, pregnancy, infancy, or childhood.Folic acid, also known as folate or Vitamin B9, is a member of the B vitamin family and an essential cofactor for enzymes involved in DNA and RNA synthesis. More specifically, folic acid is required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. As a result, supplementation with 1-5mg of folic acid is recommended to prevent deficiency and a number of side effects associated with MTX therapy including mouth ulcers and gastrointestinal irritation. Folic acid is typically supplemented during pregnancy to prevent the development of NTDs and in individuals with alcoholism to prevent the development of neurological disorders, for example.Folic acid is a water-soluble B-complex vitamin found in foods such as liver, kidney, yeast, and leafy, green vegetables. More specifically, folic acid is required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein."
105,DB00159,"It serves as the precursor for the prostaglandin-3 and thromboxane-3 families. Both 20-carbon omega-6 fatty acids (arachidonic acid) and 20-carbon omega-3 fatty acids (EPA) can be found in cell membranes. During an inflammatory response, arachidonic acid and EPA are metabolized by enzymes known as cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases to form eicosanoids. Increasing omega-3 fatty acid intake increases the EPA content of cell membranes and decreases the arachidonic acid content, resulting in higher proportions of eicosanoids derived from EPA. It also appears to affect the function and bind to the Carbohydrate responsive element binding protein (ChREBP) and to a fatty acid receptor (G-coupled receptor) known as GP40."
106,DB00162,"For the treatment of vitamin A deficiency.Retinol and derivatives of retinol that play an essential role in metabolic functioning of the retina, the growth of and differentiation of epithelial tissue, the growth of bone, reproduction, and the immune response. It is also important for the maintenance of the proper functioning of the immune system.Vision:Vitamin A (all-trans retinol) is converted in the retina to the 11-cis-isomer of retinaldehyde or 11-cis-retinal. 11-cis-retinal, while attached to opsin in rhodopsin is isomerized to all-trans-retinal by light. All-trans-retinal is then released from opsin and reduced to all-rans-retinol. Epithelial differentiation: The role of Vitamin A in epithelial differentiation, as well as in other physiological processes, involves the binding of Vitamin A to two families of nuclear retinoid receptors (retinoic acid receptors, RARs; and retinoid-X receptors, RXRs)."
107,DB00163,"Vitamin E supplementation is indicated for treatment of vitamin E deficiency which can occur in cystic fibrosis, cholestasis and severe liver disease, abetalipoproteinemia or simply poor diet.In 1922, vitamin E was demonstrated to be an essential nutrient. Vitamin E is a term used to describe 8 different fat soluble tocopherols and tocotrienols, alpha-tocopherol being the most biologically active. Preliminary research suggests vitamin E may help prevent or delay coronary heart disease and protect against the damaging effects of free radicals, which may contribute to the development of chronic diseases such as cancer. Low levels of vitamin E have been linked to increased incidence of breast and colon cancer.The mechanism of action for most of vitamin E's effects are still unknown. Vitamin E is an antioxidant, preventing free radical reactions with cell membranes."
108,DB00165,"As its classification as a vitamin implies, Vitamin B6 (and pyridoxine) are essential nutrients required for normal functioning of many biological systems within the body. While many plants and microorganisms are able to synthesize pyridoxine through endogenous biological processes, animals must obtain it through their diet. More specifically, pyridoxine is converted to pyridoxal 5-phosphate in the body, which is an important coenzyme for synthesis of amino acids, neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine), sphingolipids, and aminolevulinic acid. It's important to note that Vitamin B6 is the collective term for a group of three related compounds, pyridoxine, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine, and their phosphorylated derivatives, pyridoxine 5'-phosphate, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate. It is also used in combination with  (as the commercially available product Diclectin) for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy.Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) is a water-soluble vitamin used in the prophylaxis and treatment of vitamin B6 deficiency and peripheral neuropathy in those receiving isoniazid (isonicotinic acid hydrazide, INH)."
109,DB00166,"In the blood stream, another chelator such as dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) or methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) is used to transfer mercury safely into the urine for excretion. It is hypothesized that this treatment-along with carnitine, dimethylglycine (DMG), Vitamin B6, folic acid, and magnesium&mdash;could be used to treat autism and amalgam poisoning. In this hypothesis, the reason why autism is difficult to treat is that mercury is attached to the brain cells and most medicines and vitamin supplements do not penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Because lipoic acid is related to cellular uptake of glucose and it is both soluble in water and fat, it is being used for treatment in diabetes. It may be helpful for people with Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease.Lipoic Acid is generally involved in oxidative decarboxylations of keto acids and is presented as a growth factor for some organisms."
110,DB00169,"Concurrently, as one of the most commonly utilized forms of vitamin D, cholecalciferol is also very frequently used as a supplement in individuals to maintain sufficient vitamin d levels in the body or to treat vitamin D deficiency, as well as various medical conditions that can be associated directly or indirectly with vitamin d insufficiency like osteoporosis and chronic kidney disease, among others .Vitamin D, in general, is a secosteroid generated in the skin when 7-dehydrocholesterol located there interacts with ultraviolet irradiation - like that commonly found in sunlight . These vitamin D metabolites subsequently facilitate the active absorption of calcium and phosphorus in the small intestine, serving to increase serum calcium and phosphate levels sufficiently to allow bone mineralization . Such deficiency is known for resulting in conditions like rickets or osteomalacia, all of which reflect inadequate mineralization of bone, enhanced compensatory skeletal demineralization, resultant decreased calcium ion blood concentrations, and increases in the production and secretion of parathyroid hormone . This final metabolite binds to endogenous vitamin d receptors, which results in a variety of regulatory roles - including maintaining  calcium balance, the regulation of parathyroid hormone, the promotion of the renal reabsorption of calcium, increased intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus, and increased calcium and phosphorus mobilization of calcium and phosphorus from bone to plasma to maintain balanced levels of each in bone and the plasma . Additionally, it is believed that when calcitriol binds with nuclear vitamin D receptors, that this bound complex itself binds to retinoic acid X receptor (RXR) to generate a heterodimeric complex that consequently binds to specific nucleotide sequences in the DNA called vitamin D response elements ."

While a vitamin K deficiency can be dangerous, especially to infants that may easily suffer from extensive hemorrhaging, an overdose can be as equally detrimental. For this reason, K3 is less often utilized medically than it was in former times.Menadione (vitamin K3) is involved as a cofactor in the posttranslational gamma-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues of certain proteins in the body. The two vitamin K-dependent proteins found in bone are osteocalcin, also known as bone G1a (gamma-carboxyglutamate) protein or BGP, and the matrix G1a protein or MGP. Gamma-carboxylation is catalyzed by the vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylases."

These adenine derivatives perform important functions in cellular metabolism. Adenine is one of four nitrogenous bases utilized in the synthesis of nucleic acids. A modified form of adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) is an imporant secondary messenger in the propagation of many hormonal stimuli. Adenine is an integral part of the structure of many coenzymes."

It was the first statin administered as the active form and not as a prodrug. The manufacturing process is followed by the hydrolysis of the lactone group and the biological hydroxylation with _Streptomyces carbophilus_ to introduce the allylic 6-alcohol group.The action of pravastatin on the 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase produces an increase in the expression of hepatic LDL receptors which in order decreases the plasma levels of LDL cholesterol. In clinical trials with patients with a history of myocardial infarction or angina with high total cholesterol, pravastatin decreased the level of total cholesterol by 18%, decreased of LDL by 27%, decreased of triglycerides by 6% and increased of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) by 4%. When coadministered with , pravastatin can reduce by 50% the levels of LDL and slow the progression of atherosclerosis and the risk of myocardial infarction and death.Pravastatin is a specific inhibitor of the hepatic HMG-CoA reductase in humans."
114,DB00176,"Has also been used in the management of bulimia nervosa .Fluvoxamine is an antidepressant which functions pharmacologically as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Though it is in the same class as other SSRI drugs, it is most often used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder. It is also used on occassion in the treatment of body dysmorphic disorder and anxiety . In vitro studies show that Fluvoxamine is a potent and selective inhibitor of neuronal serotonin reuptake and has only very weak effects on norepinephrine and dopamine neuronal reuptake . Furthermore, some studies have demonstrated that the chronic administration of Fluvoxamine was found to downregulate brain norepinephrine receptors (as has been observed with other drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder), while others suggest the opposite .The exact mechanism of action of fluvoxamine has not been fully determined, but appears to be linked to its inhibition of CNS neuronal uptake of serotonin ."
115,DB00177,"It is also indicated for the treatment of heart failure (NYHA class II-IV) and for left ventricular dysfunction or failure after myocardial infarction when the use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) is not appropriate.Valsartan belongs to the angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) family of drugs, which also includes , , , , and . Valsartan was initially approved in 1996 in Europe for the treatment of hypertension in adults. Patients with heart failure given valsartan commonly have some reduction in blood pressure, but discontinuation of therapy because of continuing symptomatic hypotension usually is not necessary when dosing instructions are followed. Dosage reduction and/or discontinuation of valsartan may be required.Valsartan belongs to the angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) family of drugs, which selectively bind to angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1) and prevent angiotensin II from binding and exerting its hypertensive effects. The increased plasma levels of angiotensin II following AT1 receptor blockade with valsartan may stimulate the unblocked AT2 receptor."
116,DB00178,"Ramiprilat is a potent, competitive inhibitor of ACE, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of angiotensin I (ATI) to angiotensin II (ATII). ATII regulates blood pressure and is a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). ADH stimulates further water reabsorption from the kidneys via insertion of aquaporin-2 channels on the apical surface of cells of the DCT and collecting tubules. Inhibiting the deactivation of bradykinin increases bradykinin levels and may sustain the effects of ramiprilat by causing increased vasodilation and decreased blood pressure.Ramipril inhibits the RAAS system by binding to and inhibiting ACE thereby preventing the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. ACE is also responsible for the breakdown of bradykinin."
117,DB00179,For the management of mild to severe hypertension. May be used to reduce cardiovascular mortality following myocardial infarction in hemodynamically stable individuals who develop clinical signs of congestive heart failure within a few days following myocardial infarction.  To reduce the rate of death
118,DB00180,"It is administered either as an oral metered-dose inhaler for the treatment of asthma or as a nasal spray for treating allergic rhinitis. Corticosteroids are naturally occurring hormones that prevent or suppress inflammation and immune responses. The antiinflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. The immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference with antigen-antibody binding. Flunisolide binds to plasma transcortin, and it becomes active when it is not bound to transcortin."
119,DB00181,"It may also be used to treat patients with spinal cord injuries and other spinal cord diseases. Baclofen was reintroduced in 1971 as a treatment for spasticity and was later approved by the FDA in 1977. It reduces the release of excitatory neurotransmitters in the pre-synaptic neurons and stimulates inhibitory neuronal signals in the post-synaptic neurons. In one cross-section study, intrathecal baclofen was more effective than oral baclofen in relieving spasticity directly at the level of the spinal cord. Baclofen is an agonist at the beta subunit of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors expressed on pre- and post-synaptic neurons."
120,DB00182,"Amphetamine is indicated for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders (ADHD) as well as for the treatment of central nervous system disorders such as narcolepsy. This use derived into a large overproduction of amphetamine and all the surplus after the war finalized ended up in the black market, producing the initiation of the illicit abuse.From its mechanism of action, it has been demonstrated that amphetamine augments the concentration of noradrenaline in the prefrontal cortex and dopamine in the striatum on a dose and time-dependent manner. The complex of the amphetamine with the ions is actively transported by monoamine reuptake transporters. This activity is not done as an inhibitor per se but more as a competitive substrate and thus, amphetamine is known to be a weak dopamine reuptake inhibitor, moderate noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor and very weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor. This mechanism of action is often overpassed as amphetamine is a weak MAO inhibitor but this mechanism cannot be dismissed."
121,DB00183,"It has also been used as a diagnostic aid.Pentagastrin is indicated as a diagnostic aid for evaluation of gastric acid secretory function. It is also effective in determining the reduction in acid output after operations for peptic ulcer, such as vagotomy or gastric resection.The exact mechanism by which pentagastrin stimulates gastric acid, pepsin, and intrinsic factor secretion is unknown; however, since pentagastrin is an analogue of natural gastrin, it is believed that it excites the oxyntic cells of the stomach to secrete to their maximum capacity. Pentagastrin stimulates pancreatic secretion, especially when administered in large intramuscular doses. Pentagastrin also increases gastrointestinal motility by a direct effect on the intestinal smooth muscle. However, it delays gastric emptying time probably by stimulation of terminal antral contractions, which enhance retropulsion."
122,DB00184,"Nicotine is also important medically because of its presence in tobacco smoke.Nicotine, the primary alkaloid in tobacco products binds stereo-selectively to nicotinic-cholinergic receptors on autonomic ganglia, the adrenal medulla, neuromuscular junctions and in the brain. Nicotine is a highly addictive substance. Nicotine is classified as a stimulant of autonomic ganglia.Nicotine is a stimulant drug that acts as an agonist at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. In the brain, nicotine binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on dopaminergic neurons in the cortico-limbic pathways. Calcium stimulates vesicle trafficking towards the plasma membrane and the release of dopamine into the synapse."
123,DB00185,"For the treatment of symptoms of dry mouth in patients with Sj&ouml;gren's Syndrome.Cevimeline is a parasympathomimetic agent that act as an agonist at the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors M1 and M3. It is indicated by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of dry mouth associated with SjÃ¶gren's syndrome.Cevimeline is a cholinergic agonist which binds to muscarinic receptors. Muscarinic agonists in sufficient dosage can increase secretion of exocrine glands, such as salivary and sweat glands and increase tone of the smooth muscle in the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts.Muscarinic agonists such as cevimeline bind and activate the muscarinic M1 and M3 receptors. The M1 receptors are common in secretory glands (exocrine glands such as salivary and sweat glands), and their activation results in an increase in secretion from the secretory glands. The M3 receptors are found on smooth muscles and in many glands which help to stimulate secretion in salivary glands, and their activation generally results in smooth muscle contraction and increased glandular secretions."
124,DB00186,"Lorazepam is FDA-approved for the short-term relief of anxiety symptoms related to anxiety disorders and anxiety associated with depressive symptoms such as anxiety-associated insomnia. Some off-label indications of lorazepam include rapid tranquilization of an agitated patient, alcohol withdrawal delirium, alcohol withdrawal syndrome, muscle spasms, insomnia, panic disorder, delirium, chemotherapy-associated anticipatory nausea and vomiting, and psychogenic catatonia.Lorazepam is a short-acting and rapidly cleared benzodiazepine used commonly as a sedative and anxiolytic. It was developed by DJ Richards, presented and marketed initially by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals in the USA in 1977. The first historic FDA label approval is reported in 1985 by the company Mutual Pharm.The effect of lorazepam in GABA-A receptors produces an increase in the frequency of opening of the chloride ion channel. However, for its effect to generate, the neurotransmitter is required."
125,DB00187,"Also used in noncompensatory sinus tachycardia where the rapid heart rate requires specific intervention.Esmolol, commonly marketed under the trade name Brevibloc, is a cardioselective beta-1 receptor blocker. Esmolol prevents the action of two naturally occurring substances: epinephrine and norepinephrine. The FDA withdrew its approval for the use of all parenteral dosage form drug products containing esmolol hydrochloride that supply 250 milligrams/milliliter of concentrated esmolol per 10-milliliter ampule. Because it predominantly blocks the beta-1 receptors in cardiac tissue, it is said to be cardioselective. At therapeutic dosages, esmolol does not have intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) or membrane-stabilizing (quinidine-like) activity."
126,DB00188,"The 26S proteasome is a protein complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway: reversible inhibition of the 26S proteasome, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of cancer cells, is thought to be the main mechanism of action of bortezomib. However, multiple mechanisms may be involved in the anticancer activity of bortezomib. In May 2003, bortezomib became the first anticancer proteasome inhibitor that was approved by the FDA under the trade name VELCADE. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is often dysregulated in pathological conditions, leading to aberrant pathway signalling and the formation of malignant cells. In one pharmacodynamic study, more than 75% of proteasome inhibition was observed in whole blood samples within one hour after dosing of bortezomib.The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is a homeostatic proteolytic pathway for intracellular protein degradation: proteins marked with a poly-ubiquitin chain are degraded to small peptides and free ubiquitin by the proteasome, which is a large multimeric protease."
127,DB00189,"Used for short-term hypnotic therapy in the management of insomnia for periods of up to one week in duration; however, this medication generally has been replaced by other sedative-hypnotic agents.Ethchlorvynol is a sedative and hypnotic drug. It has been used to treat insomnia, but has been largely superseded and is only offered where an intolerance or allergy to other drugs exists.Ethchlorvynol is a sedative drug and schedule IV (USA) controlled substance. It produces cerebral depression, however the exact mechanism of action is not known.Although the exact mechanism of action is unknown, ethchlorvynol appears to depress the central nervous system in a manner similar to that of barbiturates. Barbiturates bind at a distinct binding sites associated with a Cl- ionopore at the GABAA receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl- ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged."
128,DB00190,"Carbidopa presents a chemical denomination of N-amino-alpha-methyl-3-hydroxy-L-tyrosine monohydrate. It potently inhibits aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (DDC) and due to its chemical properties, it does not cross the blood-brain barrier. The action of carbidopa is very important as  is able to cross the blood-brain barrier while dopamine cannot. Hence the administration of carbidopa is essential to prevent the transformation of external  to dopamine before reaching the main action site in the brain.This effect has been highly observed by a significant reduction in  requirements and a significant reduction in the presence of side effects such as nausea. It has been observed that the effect of carbidopa is not dose-dependent.Carbidopa is an inhibitor of the DDC which in order, inhibits the peripheral metabolism of levodopa."
129,DB00191,"Phentermine is indicated, alone or in combination with topiramate, as a short-term adjunct, not pass a few weeks, in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modifications and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity for patients with an initial body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 kg/m2 or greater than 27 kg/m2 in presence of other risk factors such as controller hypertension, diabetes or hyperlipidemia. It is an epidemic condition in the United States where over two-thirds of adults are overweight or obese and one in three Americans is obese. It is chemically related to amphetamine and it is commonly referred to as an atypical amphetamine. Some reports have indicated that the weight loss effect is mainly due to the increase in resting energy expenditure. As well, even though it is a derivative of the amphetamines, it has not been registered to produce any of the effects of amphetamine such as central nervous system stimulation, elevation of blood pressure, tachyphylaxis or QTc prolongation.Phentermine is an indirect-acting sympathomimetic agent that acts by releasing noradrenaline from the presynaptic vesicles in the lateral hypothalamus."
130,DB00193,"Tramadol has also been shown to affect a number of other pain modulators within the central nervous system as well as non-neuronal inflammatory markers and immune mediators. Due to the broad spectrum of targets involved in pain and inflammation, it's not surprising that the evidence has shown that tramadol is effective for a number of pain types including neuropathic pain, post-operative pain, lower back pain, as well as pain associated with labour, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, and cancer. Similar to other opioid medications, tramadol poses a risk for development of tolerance, dependence and abuse.Tramadol modulates the descending pain pathways within the central nervous system through the binding of parent and M1 metabolite to Î¼-opioid receptors and the weak inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. During tramadol treatment, monitoring for signs and symptoms of hyponatremia is recommended for patients with predisposing risk factors. Particular care should be exercised when administering tramadol to patients who are suspected to be at an increased risk of experiencing torsade de pointes during treatment with a QTc-prolonging drug.Therefore, tramadol should be prescribed and handled with caution.Tramadol is a centrally acting Î¼-opioid receptor agonist and SNRI (serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake-inhibitor) that is structurally related to  and ."
131,DB00194,"It has some antineoplastic properties and has broad spectrum activity against DNA viruses in cell cultures and significant antiviral activity against infections caused by a variety of viruses such as the herpes viruses, the vaccinia VIRUS and varicella zoster virus.Vidarabine is a synthetic purine nucleoside analogue with in vitro and in vivo inhibitory activity against herpes simplex virus types 1 (HSV-1), 2 (HSV-2), and varicella-zoster virus (VZV). This viral enzyme converts Vidarabine into Vidarabine monophosphate, a nucleotide analogue. In vitro, Vidarabine triphosphate stops the DNA replication of herpes virus by being incorporated into the DNA strand and preventing the formation of phosphodiester bridges between bases. Vidarabine is sequentially phosphorylated by kinases to the triphosphate ara-ATP, which is the active form of vidarabine that acts as both an inhibitor and a substrate of viral DNA polymerase. By acting as a substrate for viral DNA polymerase, ara-ATP competitively inhibits dATP leading to the formation of âfaultyï¿½?DNA."
132,DB00195,"For the management of hypertension.A cardioselective beta-1-adrenergic antagonist with no partial agonist activity.Betaxolol is a competitive, beta(1)-selective (cardioselective) adrenergic antagonist. Drugs such as betaxolol that block these receptors therefore have the reverse effect: they lower the heart rate and blood pressure and hence are used in conditions when the heart itself is deprived of oxygen. They are routinely prescribed in patients with ischemic heart disease. In addition, beta(1)-selective blockers prevent the release of renin, which is a hormone produced by the kidneys which leads to constriction of blood vessels. Betaxolol is lipophilic and exhibits no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) or membrane stabilizing activity.Betaxolol selectively blocks catecholamine stimulation of beta(1)-adrenergic receptors in the heart and vascular smooth muscle."
133,DB00196,"**A note on laboratory testing**    Obtaining specimens for fungal culture and other important laboratory studies such as serology or pathology is advised before starting fluconazole therapy in order to isolate the organisms to be eliminated through treatment. Fluconazole, commonly known as _Diflucan_, is an antifungal drug used for the treatment of both systemic and superficial fungal infections in a variety of tissues. It has been demonstrated as an efficacious treatment for vaginal yeast infections in one single dose.Fluconazole has been demonstrated to show fungistatic activity against the majority of strains of the following microorganisms, curing fungal infections:    _Candida albicans, Candida glabrata (Many strains are intermediately susceptible), Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, Cryptococcus neoformans_    This is achieved through steroidal inhibition in fungal cells, interfering with cell wall synthesis and growth as well as cell adhesion, thereby treating fungal infections and their symptoms. The fungistatic activity of fluconazole has also been shown in normal and immunocompromised animal models with both systemic and intracranial fungal infections caused by _Cryptococcus neoformans_ and for systemic infections caused by Candida albicans. Other studies have shown no significant effects of fluconazole on steroid levels, further confirming these data.Fluconazole is a very selective inhibitor of fungal cytochrome P450 dependent enzyme _lanosterol 14-Î±-demethylase_."
134,DB00197,"For the treatment of Type II diabetes mellitus. It is used alone or in combination with a sulfonylurea, metformin, or insulin as an adjunct to diet and exercise.Troglitazone was withdrawn in 2000 due to risk of hepatotoxicity. Troglitazone is not chemically or functionally related to either the sulfonylureas, the biguanides, or the g-glucosidase inhibitors. Troglitazone may be used concomitantly with a sulfonylurea or insulin to improve glycemic control.Troglitazone is a thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agent that lowers blood glucose by improving target cell response to insulin. It has a unique mechanism of action that is dependent on the presence of insulin for activity."
135,DB00198,"According to FDA prescribing information, oseltamivir is indicated for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated illness due to influenza A and B infection in patients 2 weeks of age and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 48 hours . Oseltamivir (marketed as the product Tamifluï¿½?, is an antiviral neuraminidase inhibitor used for the treatment and prophylaxis of infection with influenza viruses A (including pandemic H1N1) and B. Oseltamivir exerts its antiviral activity by inhibiting the activity of the viral neuraminidase enzyme found on the surface of the virus, which prevents budding from the host cell, viral replication, and infectivity. The clinical benefit of use of oseltamivir is greatest when administered within 48 hours of the onset of influenza symptoms since effectiveness decreases significantly after that point in time; there is generally no benefit in use beyond 48 hours for healthy, low-risk individuals as influenza is a self-limiting illness. The authors concluded that oseltamivir use in healthy adults had small, non-specific effects on symptoms (where the time to first alleviation of symptoms was only reduced from 7 to 6.3 days), it had no effect on hospitalizations, and that there was no evidence for any reductions in complications of influenza such as pneumonia. Because these events were reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made but they appear to be uncommon based on oseltamivir."
136,DB00199,"Erythromycin is indicated in the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of various bacteria. The indications for erythromycin have been summarized by body system below:    **Respiratory infections**    Mild to moderate upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Haemophilus influenzae (when used concomitantly with appropriate doses of sulfonamides) can be treated with erythromycin. Clinical studies suggest that erythromycin may aid in the prevention of pertussis infection for individuals who have been exposed to the bacteria. Erythromycin can be used in nongonococcal urethritis can be used when tetracyclines cannot be administered. This results in the control of various bacterial infections."
137,DB00200,"The second cofactor, Methylcobalamin, is necessary for the conversion of homocysteine to methionine which is essential for the metabolism of folic acid. Deficiency of tetrahydrafolate leads to reduced synthesis of thymidylate resulting in reduced synthesis of DNA which is essential for cell maturation. Vitamin B12 is also concerned in the maintenance of sulphydryl groups in reduced form, deficiency leading to decreased amounts of reduced SH content of erythrocytes and liver cells. Two of these, methylcobalamin and 5-deoxyadenosyl cobalamin, are primarily used by the body. This enzyme is involved in the conversion of the amino acid homocysteine into methionine."
138,DB00201,"Caffeine is also used in a variety of cosmetic products and can be administered topically, orally, by inhalation, or by injection. One probable mechanism is the inhibition of nucleotide phosphodiesterase enzymes, adenosine receptors, regulation of calcium handling in cells, and participates in adenosine receptor antagonism. **Respiratory**    The exact mechanism of action of caffeine in treating apnea related to prematurity is unknown, however, there are several proposed mechanisms, including respiratory center stimulation in the central nervous system, a reduced threshold to hypercapnia with increased response, and increased consumption of oxygen, among others. Blocking of adenosine receptors promotes catecholamine release, leading to stimulatory effects occurring in the heart and the rest of the body. In the blood vessels, caffeine exerts direct antagonism of adenosine receptors, causing vasodilation."
139,DB00202,"Its rapid onset and offset, with effects beginning within 60 seconds of intravenous administration and lasting between four to six minutes, make succinylcholine particularly useful in the setting of short medical procedures requiring brief periods of muscle relaxation.Succinylcholine's neuromuscular blockade takes effect within 60 seconds of intravenous administration and lasts between four to six minutes. Succinylcholine has no direct action on smooth or cardiac muscle, nor does it appear to act on pre-synaptic or ganglionic acetylcholine receptors. There have been rare reports of the development of acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia - resulting in ventricular dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death - after the intravenous administration of succinylcholine to apparently healthy pediatric patients who were subsequently found to have undiagnosed skeletal myopathy (most frequently Duchenne's muscular dystrophy). Given that patients may not present with any apparent risk factors, the use of succinylcholine in pediatric patients should be restricted to emergency intubation or other situations in which a suitable alternative is unavailable.Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker, meaning it causes a prolonged period of membrane depolarization in order to exert its therapeutic effects. It binds to the post-synaptic cholinergic receptors found on motor endplates, thereby inducing first transient fasciculations followed by skeletal muscle paralysis."
140,DB00203,"Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor that is predominantly employed for two primary indications:    (1) the treatment of erectile dysfunction ; and    (2) treatment of pulmonary hypertension, where:  a) the US FDA specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (WHO Group I) in adults to improve exercise ability and delay clinical worsening . After chronic dosing of 80 mg three times a day to patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension no clinically relevant effects on the ECG were reported either . In a study of the hemodynamic effects of a single oral 100 mg dose of sildenafil in 14 patients with severe coronary artery disease (CAD) (> 70 % stenosis of at least one coronary artery), the mean resting systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased by 7 % and 6 % respectively compared to baseline . In the natural setting, i.e. with sexual stimulation, it restores impaired erectile function by increasing blood flow to the penis . When the NO/cGMP pathway is activated, as occurs with sexual stimulation, inhibition of PDE5 by sildenafil results in increased corpus cavernosum levels of cGMP ."
141,DB00204,"For the maintenance of normal sinus rhythm (delay in time to recurrence of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter ) in patients with atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter of greater than one week duration who have been converted to normal sinus rhythmDofetilide is a class III antiarrhythmic agent that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the maintenance of sinus rhythm in individuals prone to the formation of atrial fibrillation and flutter, and for the chemical cardioversion to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation and flutter.Dofetilide is an antiarrhythmic drug with Class III (cardiac action potential duration prolonging) properties and is indicated for the maintenance of normal sinus rhythm. Dofetilide increases the monophasic action potential duration in a predictable, concentration-dependent manner, primarily due to delayed repolarization. At concentrations covering several orders of magnitude, Dofetilide blocks only IKr with no relevant block of the other repolarizing potassium currents (e.g., IKs, IK1). At clinically relevant concentrations, Dofetilide has no effect on sodium channels (associated with Class I effect), adrenergic alpha-receptors, or adrenergic beta-receptors.The mechanism of action of Dofetilide is a blockade of the cardiac ion channel carrying the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current, IKr. This inhibition of potassium channels results in a prolongation of action potential duration and the effective refractory period of accessory pathways (both anterograde and retrograde conduction in the accessory pathway)."
142,DB00205,"For the treatment of toxoplasmosis and acute malaria; For the prevention of malaria in areas non-resistant to pyrimethamineOne of the folic acid antagonists that is used as an antimalarial or with a sulfonamide to treat toxoplasmosis.Pyrimethamine is an antiparasitic compound commonly used as an adjunct in the treatment of uncomplicated, chloroquine resistant, P. falciparum malaria. Pyrimethamine possesses blood schizonticidal and some tissue schizonticidal activity against malaria parasites of humans. However, the 4-amino-quinoline compounds are more effective against the erythrocytic schizonts. It does not destroy gametocytes, but arrests sporogony in the mosquito. The action of pyrimethamine against Toxoplasma gondii is greatly enhanced when used in conjunction with sulfonamides.Pyrimethamine inhibits the dihydrofolate reductase of plasmodia and thereby blocks the biosynthesis of purines and pyrimidines, which are essential for DNA synthesis and cell multiplication."
143,DB00206,"For the treatment of hypertensionAn alkaloid found in the roots of Rauwolfia serpentina and R. vomitoria. Reserpine inhibits the uptake of norepinephrine into storage vesicles resulting in depletion of catecholamines and serotonin from central and peripheral axon terminals. It has been used as an antihypertensive and an antipsychotic as well as a research tool, but its adverse effects limit its clinical use. The FDA withdrew its approval for the use of all oral dosage form drug products containing more than 1 mg of reserpine.Reserpine is an adrenergic blocking agent used to treat mild to moderate hypertension via the disruption of norepinephrine vesicular storage. The antihypertensive actions of Reserpine are a result of its ability to deplete catecholamines from peripheral sympathetic nerve endings."

It is primarily used for the treatment of respiratory, enteric and genitourinary infections and may be used instead of other macrolides for some sexually transmitted and enteric infections. In order to replicate, bacteria require a specific process of protein synthesis, enabled by ribosomal proteins . This results in the control of various bacterial infections , ."
145,DB00208,"Used in patients, who have had a stroke or stroke precursors and who cannot take aspirin or aspirin has not worked, to try to prevent another thrombotic stroke. It is a prodrug that is metabolised to an active form, which blocks the ADP receptor that is involved in GPIIb/IIIa receptor activation leading to platelet aggregation. The FDA label includes a black-box warning of neutropenia, aplastic anemia, thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura, and agranulocytosis, so it is necessary to monitor patients' WBC and platelets when they are taking ticlopidine.Ticlopidine is a prodrug that is metabolised to an as yet undetermined metabolite that acts as a platelet aggregation inhibitor. In its prodrug form, ticlopidine has no significant in vitro activity at the concentrations attained in vivo.The active metabolite of ticlopidine prevents binding of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to its platelet receptor, impairing the ADP-mediated activation of the glycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa complex. It is proposed that the inhibition involves a defect in the mobilization from the storage sites of the platelet granules to the outer membrane."
146,DB00209,"For the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency, detrusor instability and frequency of micturition.Trospium is an antispasmodic agent used to treat the symptoms of overactive bladder, a condition that causes the bladder muscles to contract uncontrollably. An overactive bladder leads to an increased urge to urinate, frequent urination, and sometimes, loss of control over urination. Trospium is manufactured by _Indevus Pharmaceutical Inc._ and was granted FDA approval in 2007.Trospium is an antispasmodic, antimuscarinic agent indicated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency. According to receptor assays, it displays higher affinity towards muscarininc receptors compared to nicotinic receptors at therapeutic concentrations. Trospium antagonizes the effect of acetylcholine on muscarinic receptors in cholinergically innervated organs."

Pantoprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cell. The enzyme is inactivated, inhibiting gastric acid secretion. The inhibition of gastric acid secretion is stronger with proton pump inhibitors such as pantoprazole and lasts longer than with the H(2) antagonists."
150,DB00214,"As well, torasemide is approved to be used as an antihypertensive agent either alone or in combination with other antihypertensives.Torasemide is a high-ceiling loop diuretic. This effect is obtained by the increase in the excretion of urinary sodium and chloride. Several reports have indicated that torasemide presents a long-lasting diuresis and less potassium excretion which can be explained by the effect that torasemide has on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Above the aforementioned effect, torasemide presents a dual effect .in which the inhibition of aldosterone which donates torasemide with a potassium-sparing action. This effect is suggested to be related to the decrease in aldosterone which in order has been shown to reduce the production of the enzyme procollagen type I carboxy-terminal proteinase which is known to be overexpressed in heart failure patients.As mentioned above, torasemide is part of the loop diuretics and thus, it acts by reducing the oxygen demand in the medullary thick ascending loop of Henle by inhibiting the Na+/K+/Cl- pump on the luminal cell membrane surface."
151,DB00215,"Citalopram is an antidepressant belonging to the class of selective _serotonin-reuptake inhibitors_ (SSRIs) widely used to treat the symptoms of depression. Citalopram enhances serotonergic transmission through the inhibition of serotonin reuptake, and among all the SSRIs, citalopram appears to be the most selective toward serotonin reuptake inhibition. Citalopram was approved by the FDA in 1998 for the treatment of depression in adults 18 years or older.Citalopram belongs to a class of antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). It has been found to relieve or manage symptoms of depression, anxiety, eating disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder among other mood disorders. The chronic administration of citalopram has been shown to downregulate central norepinephrine receptors, similar to other drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder."
152,DB00216,"For the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults.Eletriptan is a second generation triptan drug developed by Pfizer Inc for the treatment of migraine headaches.Eletriptan is a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine 1B/1D receptor agonist. In the anesthetized dog, eletriptan has been shown to reduce carotid arterial blood flow, with only a small increase in arterial blood pressure at high doses. While the effect on blood flow was selective for the carotid arterial bed, decreases in coronary artery diameter were observed. In contrast, eletriptan displays insignificant pharmacological activity at adrenergic alpha1, alpha2, or beta; dopaminergic D1 or D2; muscarinic; or opioid receptors. While the full mechanism of action of 5-HT receptor agonists in relieving migrains is not fully elucidated, it is proposed that the activation of 5-HT1 receptors located on intracranial blood vessels leads to vasoconstriction that correlates with the relief of migraine headaches."
153,DB00217,"For the treatment of hypertension.A guanidinium antihypertensive agent that acts by blocking adrenergic transmission.Bethanidine is a guanidinium antihypertensive agent that acts by blocking adrenergic transmission. The precise mode of action is not clear. Although bethanidine may produce adverse effects, they are beneficial in severe hypertension and produce fewer side effects than guanethidine.Bethanidine, a guanidine derivative, is a peripherally acting antiadrenergic agent which primarily acts as an alpha2a adrenergic agonist. Bethanidine effectively decreases blood pressure by suppressing renin secretion or interfering with function of the sympathetic nervous system."
154,DB00218,"Also for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis (pinkeye).Moxifloxacin is a synthetic fluoroquinolone antibiotic agent. Bayer AG developed the drug (initially called BAY 12-8039) and it is marketed worldwide (as the hydrochloride) under the brand name Avelox (in some countries also Avalox) for oral treatment.Moxifloxacin is a quinolone/fluoroquinolone antibiotic. Moxifloxacin can be used to treat infections caused by the following bacteria: Aerobic Gram-positive microorganisms: _Corynebacterium_ species, _Micrococcus luteus_, _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Staphylococcus epidermidis_, _Staphylococcus haemolyticus_, _Staphylococcus hominis_, _Staphylococcus warneri_, _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, and _Streptococcus viridans_ group. Aerobic Gram-negative microorganisms: _Acinetobacter lwoffii_, _Haemophilus influenzae_, and _Haemophilus parainfluenzae_. Moxifloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.The bactericidal action of moxifloxacin results from inhibition of the enzymes topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV."
155,DB00219,"For the treatment of visceral spasmsA quaternary ammonium anticholinergic agent with peripheral side effects similar to those of atropine. Oxyphenonium is an anticholinergic drug, a medication that reduces the effect of acetylcholine, a chemical released from nerves that stimulates muscles, by blocking the receptors for acetylcholine on smooth muscle (a type of muscle). It also has a direct relaxing effect on smooth muscle. Oxyphenonium is used to treat or prevent spasm in the muscles of the gastrointestinal tract in the irritable bowel syndrome. In addition, Oxyphenonium inhibits gastrointestinal propulsive motility and decreases gastric acid secretion and controls excessive pharyngeal, tracheal and bronchial secretions.Action is achieved via a dual mechanism: (1) a specific anticholinergic effect (antimuscarinic) at the acetylcholine-receptor sites and (2) a direct effect upon smooth muscle (musculotropic)."
156,DB00220,"Nelfinavir inhibits the HIV viral proteinase enzyme which prevents cleavage of the gag-pol polyprotein, resulting in noninfectious, immature viral particles.Nelfinavir is a protease inhibitor with activity against Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1). Protease inhibitors block the part of HIV called protease. This inhibition prevents cleavage of the viral polyproteins resulting in the formation of immature non-infectious viral particles. Protease inhibitors are almost always used in combination with at least two other anti-HIV drugs.HIV viral protease is an important enzyme for HIV maturation and pathogenicity since HIV produces its structural and key proteins in the form of a polyprotein that needs to be cleaved by a protease. Nelfinavir is a competitive inhibitor of the HIV protease by reversibly binding to the active site of the enzyme, preventing it from interacting with its substrate to produce mature and infectious viral particles."
157,DB00221,"For the treatment of asthma, wheezing, and chronic asthmatic bronchitis.Isoetharine is a relatively selective beta-2 adrenergic agonist. It is a catechol-like agent. Isoetharine is a fast-acting bronchodilator used for emphysema, bronchitis and asthma.Isoetharine is a beta-adrenergic receptor agonist. While it is reported to demonstrate more selectivity towards beta-2 adrenergic receptors, isoetharine still binds to beta-1 adrenergic receptors and thus may be associated with beta-1-mediated adverse events. Isoetharine produces maximal bronchodilation within 15 minutes of inhalation.Isoetharine-induced bronchodilator occurs from an increased activity of adenyl cyclase, which augments the formation of cyclic AMP (cAMP)."
158,DB00222,"It may also be indicated for use in combination with metformin or insulin to lower blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes whose high blood sugar levels cannot be controlled by diet and exercise in conjunction with an oral hypoglycemic (a drug used to lower blood sugar levels) agent alone.First introduced in 1995, glimepiride is a member of the second-generation sulfonylurea (SU) drug class used for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to improve glycemic control. Glimepiride works by stimulating the secretion of insulin granules from pancreatic islet beta cells by blocking ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K<SUB>ATP</SUB> channels) and causing depolarization of the beta cells. In this study, there was a reduction in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) by 46 mg/dL, post-prandial glucose (PPG) by 72 mg/dL, and HbA1c by 1.4% more than the placebo. The 4- and 8-mg doses of glimepiride were more effective than the 1-mg dose; however, the 4-mg dose provided a nearly maximal antihyperglycemic effect.ATP-sensitive potassium channels on pancreatic beta cells that are gated by intracellular ATP and ADP. In contrast, increased uptake of glucose into the cell leads to elevated intracellular ATP:ADP ratio, leading to the closure of channels and membrane depolarization."
159,DB00223,"Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Diflorasone is a potent topical corticosteroid that should not be used with occlusive dressings. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2."

161,DB00225,"Gadodiamide is indicated for the visualization of lesions with abnormal vascularity in the brain (intracranial lesions), spine, and associated tissues and the body (including  the thoracic (noncardiac), abdominal, pelvic cavities, and retroperitoneal space) by the FDA and Health Canada. Gadodiamide is a linear, non-ionic gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) that is used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedures to assist in the visualization of blood vessels. GBCAs constitute the largest group of MR agents, and they are thought to be safer than nonionic iodinated contrast agents. As water protons move through this local magnetic field, the changes in the magnetic field experienced by the protons reorient them with the main magnetic field more quickly than in the absence of a paramagnetic agent. At clinical doses, the effect is primarily on the T1 relaxation time and produces an increase in signal intensity."
162,DB00226,"Used to treat and control hypertension.Guanadrel is an antihypertensive agent and postganglionic adrenergic blocking agent.High blood pressure adds to the work load of the heart and arteries. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if blood pressure is controlled. This helps to lower blood pressure.Guanadrel is an adrenergic neuron inhibitor that slowly displaces norepinephrine from its storage in nerve endings."
163,DB00227,"Lovastatin is indicated to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and the need for coronary revascularization procedures in individuals without symptomatic cardiovascular disease, average to moderately elevated total-C and LDL-C, and below average HDL-C. Lovastatin is also indicated to slow the progression of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with coronary heart disease as part of a treatment strategy to lower total-C and LDL-C to target levels. While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint,  is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg  per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decrease in LDL cholesterol levels, while lovastatin has been found to have an average decrease in LDL-C of 25-40%. Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors coadministered with , and caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing these two medications together. The overall effect is a decrease in plasma LDL and VLDL and a significant reduction in the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality."
164,DB00228,"Low concentrations of enflurane can also be used as an adjunct to general anesthetic drugs during delivery by Cesarean section.Enflurane is a halogenated inhalational anesthetic initially approved by the FDA in 1972. Studies on rats indicate that enflurane binds to GABAA and glycine receptors, causing depressant effects at the ventral neural horn. It has been reported that 30% of the central nervous system depressant effects on the spinal cord after enflurane is administered are caused by the (GABA-A) receptor while binding to glycine receptors is responsible for about 20 % of the depressant effects. Other studies have found that enflurane binds to the calcium channels in the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum causing cardio depressant effects. Other studies support that this drug potentiates glycine receptors, which results in central nervous system depressant effects."
165,DB00229,For treatment of severe infections caused by susceptible bacteria.One of the cephalosporins that has a broad spectrum of activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms.Cefotiam is a third generation beta-lactam cephalosporin antibiotic that works by inhibiting bacterial cell wall biosynthesis. It is a broad spectrum antibiotic that is effective against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria.The bactericidal activity of cefotiam results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs).
166,DB00230,"Pregabalin is indicated for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury, and as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients 1 month of age and older.Pregabalin is structurally similar to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) - an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Pregabalin is marketed by Pfizer under the trade name Lyrica and Lyrica Cr (extended release). It may have dependence liability if misused but the risk appears to be highest in patients with current or past substance use disorders.Although the structure of pregabalin is similar to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), it does not bind to GABA receptors. Although the mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated, studies involving structurally related drugs suggest that presynaptic binding of pregabalin to voltage-gated calcium channels is key to the antiseizure and antinociceptive effects observed in animal models. Although pregabalin is a structural derivative of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), it does not bind directly to GABA or benzodiazepine receptors."
167,DB00231,"Although the chemical synthesis of temazepam was established by 1965 , mainstream contemporary use of the medication did not occur until it's legitimate use as treatment for insomnia was accepted and approved later on. Temazepam increases the affinity of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) for GABA receptors by binding to benzodiazepine receptors . Conversely, if half-lives are short, the drug and metabolites would be cleared before the next dose is ingested, and carry-over effects related to sedation or CNS depression should be minimal or not present at all . However, during nightly use and for an extended period, pharmacodynamic tolerance or adaptation to some effects of benzodiazepine hypnotics may develop - which may also contribute to the possibility of 'rebound insomnia' . Combined with the notion that such benzodiazepine receptor associated GABA(a) receptors exist both peripherally and in the CNS, this activity consequently facilitates various effects like sedation, hypnosis, skeletal muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, and anxiolytic action ."
168,DB00233,"The sodium salt of the drug is better tolerated than the free acid.The two major considerations in the clinical pharmacology of aminosalicylic acid are the prompt production of a toxic inactive metabolite under acid conditions and the short serum half life of one hour for the free drug. Aminosalicylic acid is bacteriostatic against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (prevents the multiplying of bacteria without destroying them). It also inhibits the onset of bacterial resistance to streptomycin and isoniazid.There are two mechanisms responsible for aminosalicylic acid's bacteriostatic action against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The binding of para-aminobenzoic acid to pteridine synthetase acts as the first step in folic acid synthesis. Aminosalicylic acid binds pteridine synthetase with greater affinity than para-aminobenzoic acid, effectively inhibiting the synthesis of folic acid."
169,DB00234,"For the treatment of clinical depression.Reboxetine is an antidepressant drug used in the treatment of clinical depression, panic disorder and ADD/ADHD. Its mesylate (i.e. methanesulfonate) salt is sold under tradenames including Edronax, Norebox, Prolift, Solvex, Davedax or Vestra. Reboxetine is an a-ariloxybenzyl derivative of morpholine. Reboxetine is primarily used to treat depression but has also been found useful in the treatment of narcolepsy and panic disorders.Reboxetine is a selective inhibitor of noradrenaline reuptake. Reboxetine does not affect dopamine or serotonin reuptake and it has low in vivo and in vitro affinity for adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic, dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors."
170,DB00235,"Milrinone is indicated for the short-term (48 hours or less) treatment of patients with acute decompensated heart failure. Often the result of long-term myocardial ischemia, cardiomyopathy, or other cardiac insults, heart failure results from an inability of the heart to perfuse peripheral tissues with sufficient oxygen and metabolites, resulting in complex systemic pathologies. Heart failure is underpinned by numerous physiological changes, including alteration in Î²-adrenergic signalling and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production, which affects the heart's contractile function and cardiac output. As a PDE-III inhibitor, milrinone results in increased cAMP levels and improves cardiac function and peripheral vasodilation in acute decongested heart failure. It was approved by the FDA on December 31, 1987, and was marketed under the trademark PRIMACORÂ® by Sanofi-Aventis US before being discontinued.Milrinone is a bipyridine derivative with positive inotropic and lusitropic effects that also results in peripheral vasodilation with minimal chronotropic effects over a therapeutic range of 100 to 300 ng/mL."

Specifically, it is a piperazine derivative with a chemical structure close to that of many DNA alkylating agents. Pipobroman has well-documented clinical activity against polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia.The mechanism of action is uncertain, but due to the structural similarity with other DNA alkylating agents, pipobroman is thought to alkylate DNA leading to disruption of DNA synthesis and eventual cell death."
172,DB00237,"Butabarbital should not be used to treat insomnia for longer than 2 weeks.Butabarbital, or Butisol, is a fast onset barbiturate with short duration of action compared to other barbiturates. This makes butabarbital a useful drug for treating severe insomnia and pre-operative anxiety. Butabarbital was granted FDA approval on 5 June 1939.Butabarbital potentiates GABAergic neurons while inhibiting neuronal acetylcholine and glutamate receptors to produce sedation. Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of worsening insomnia, drowsiness, falls, and complex behaviour while not fully awake.Barbiturates like butabarbital potentiate GABA-A receptors and inhibit receptors for neuronal acetylcholine, and kainate. Inhibition of neuronal acetylcholine receptors and glutamate receptors of the kainate subtype desensitize their respective neurons, producing sedation."
173,DB00238,"A potent, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) used for treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) infection and AIDS. Structurally, nevirapine belongs to the dipyridodiazepinone chemical class.Nevirapine is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (nNRTI) with activity against Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1). HIV-2 RT and eukaryotic DNA polymerases (such as human DNA polymerases alpha, beta, or sigma) are not inhibited by nevirapine. Nevirapine is, in general, only prescribed after the immune system has declined and infections have become evident. It is always taken with at least one other HIV medication such as Retrovir or Videx."

It has fungicidal or fungistatic activity in vitro against a number of pathogenic fungi including the following dermatophytes, and yeasts: T. rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, T. violaceum, E. floccosum, M. canis,M. It acts to destabilize the fungal cyctochrome P450 51 enzyme (also known as Lanosterol 14-alpha demethylase). Its inhibition leads to cell lysis. Oxiconazole has also been shown in inhibit DNA synthesis and suppress intracellular concentrations of ATP."
175,DB00240,"Alclometasone is a selective glucocorticoid receptor agonist.The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2. This complex migrates to the nucleus where it binds to different glucocorticoid response elements on the DNA."
176,DB00241,"It is a short-to-intermediate acting member of barbiturates that exhibit muscle-relaxing and anti-anxiety properties that produce central nervous system (CNS) depression that ranges from mild sedation to general anesthesia. Butalbitalâcontaining analgesics can also produce a drugâinduced headache in addition to tolerance and dependence. Due to these risks, the use of butalbital-containing combination products is typically limited for use only in cases where other medications are deemed ineffective and such usage is advised to be carefully monitored.Butalbital is a short to intermediate-acting barbiturate that reversibly depresses the activity of excitable tissues, including the central nervous system in a nonselective manner. While butalbital is expected to mediate similar actions as other members of the barbiturate drug class, the effects of butalbital in isolation are not well understood. It is also proposed that barbiturates and opioids may potentiate the analgesic effects of each other when co-administered, although there are inconsistencies across preclinical data."
177,DB00242,"For the treatment of active hairy cell leukemia (leukemic reticuloendotheliosis) as defined by clinically significant anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or disease-related symptoms. Also used as an alternative agent for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.An antineoplastic agent used in the treatment of lymphoproliferative diseases including hairy-cell leukemia.Cladribine is a synthetic purine nucleoside that acts as an antineoplastic agent with immunosuppressive effects. Cladribine differs structurally from deoxyadenosine only by the presence of a chlorine atom at position 2 of the purine ring, which results in resistance to enzymatic degradation by adenosine deaminase. Due to this resistance, cladribine exhibits a more prolonged cytotoxic effect than deoxyadenosine against resting and proliferating lymphocytes. Although the exact mechanism of action has not been fully determined, evidence shows that cladribine is phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase to the nucleotidecladribine triphosphate (CdATP; 2-chloro-2ï¿½?deoxyadenosine 5ï¿½?triphosphate), which accumulates and is incorporated into DNA in cells such as lymphocytes that contain high levels of deoxycytidine kinase and low levels of deoxynucleotidase, resulting in DNA strand breakage and inhibition of DNA synthesis and repair."
178,DB00243,"With a mechanism of action different from drugs used to treat the same condition, ranolazine is a promising anti-anginal therapy. Ranolazine exerts its therapeutic effects without negative chronotropic, dromotropic, or inotropic actions neither at rest, nor during exercise.Myocardial ischemia exerts effects on adenosine triphosphate flux, leading to a decrease in the energy available for contraction and relaxation of the heart muscle. Electrolyte balance of sodium and potassium is necessary for maintaining normal cardiac contraction and relaxation. Disruption of adequate sodium and potassium electrolyte balance leads to excessively high concentrations of sodium and calcium, which likely interferes with oxygen supply to the heart muscle. The clinical significance this inhibition in the treatment of angina symptoms is not yet confirmed."

Mesalazine is also indicated for the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis in adults and maintenance of remission of Crohn's ileocolitis. An anti-inflammatory agent, structurally related to the salicylates and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like acetylsalicylic acid, which is active in inflammatory bowel disease . Although demonstrably effective in treating and maintaining remission for ulcerative colitis, mesalazine has historically faced a number of issues regarding its lack of stability as a pharmaceutical agent . Throughout the late seventies and the eighties, important research initiatives developed stable mesalazine formulations like the eudragit-S coating of Asacol brand mesalazine and the Pentasa brand's encapsulation of mesalazine within microgranules . Moreover, since increased leukocyte migration, abnormal cytokine production, increased production of arachidonic acid metabolites, particularly leukotriene B4, and increased free radical formation in the inflamed intestinal tissue are all present in patients with inflammatory bowel disease it is also believed that mesalazine has in-vitro and in-vivo pharmacological effects that inhibit leukocyte chemotaxis, decrease cytokine and leukotriene production and scavenge for free radicals."
180,DB00245,"Parkinsonism is a general term that refers to the group of neurological disorders that produce symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease such as tremors, slow movement, and stiffness. Reports have indicated that benztropine has a very large sedative effect. The antihistaminic effect of benztropine is very similar to the effect found in  and the anticholinergic activity was found to be equal to  _ex vivo_ and of about 50% activity _in vivo_.Benztropine is an agent with anti-muscarinic and antihistaminic effects. Its main mechanism of action is presented by the selective inhibition of dopamine transporters but it also presents affinity for histamine and muscarine receptors. As well, it is known to be an analog of atropine and hence, it has a large affinity for muscarinic receptors M1 in the human brain."
181,DB00246,"In its oral form, ziprasidone is approved for the treatment of schizophrenia, as monotherapy for acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes related to bipolar I disorder, and as adjunctive therapy to lithium or valproate for maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder. The injectable formulation is approved only for treatment of acute agitation in schizophrenia.Disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder can significantly impair mood, cognition, and behavior. It can effectively reduce the rate and time of relapses in schizophrenia, and can be used to treat manic episodes in bipolar disorder although the mechanism of action is unknown. Although ziprasidone is classified as an atypical antipsychotic, it appears to have a lower incidence of metabolic adverse effects compared to other medications in the same class.Ziprasidone is classified as a ""second generation"" or ""atypical"" antipsychotic and is a dopamine and 5HT2A receptor antagonist with a unique receptor binding profile. Ziprasidone binds to serotonin-2A (5-HT2A) and dopamine D2 receptors in a similar fashion to other atypical antipsychotics; however, one key difference is that ziprasidone has a higher 5-HT2A/D2 receptor affinity ratio when compared to other antipsychotics such as olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and aripiprazole."
182,DB00247,"For the treatment of vascular headacheAn ergot derivative that is a congener of lysergic acid diethylamide. It antagonizes the effects of serotonin in blood vessels and gastrointestinal smooth muscle, but has few of the properties of other ergot alkaloids. Methysergide is used prophylactically in migraine and other vascular headaches and to antagonize serotonin in the carcinoid syndrome.Methysergide has been shown,in vitro and in vivo, to inhibit or block the effects of serotonin, a substance which may be involved in the mechanism of vascular headaches. Serotonin has been variously described as a central neurohumoral agent or chemical mediator, as a ""headache substance"" acting directly or indirectly to lower pain threshold, as an intrinsic ""motor hormone"" of the gastrointestinal tract, and as a ""hormone"" involved in connective tissue reparative processes.Methysergide is serotonin antagonists acts on central nervous system (CNS), which directly stimulates the smooth muscle leading to vasoconstriction. Some alpha-adrenergic blocking activity has been reported."
183,DB00248,It is used to treat hyperprolactinemic disorders and Parkinsonian Syndrome. High dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway of the brain causes hallucinations and delusions; these side effects of dopamine agonists are manifestations seen in patients with schizophrenia who have overractivity in this area of the brain. The hallucinogenic side effects of dopamine agonists may also be due to 5-HT2A agonism. Stimulation of dopamine D2 receptors in the nigrostriatal pathway leads to improvements in coordinated muscle activity in those with movement disorders. Cabergoline is a long-acting dopamine receptor agonist with a high affinity for D2 receptors.
184,DB00250,"For the treatment and management of leprosy and dermatitis herpetiformis.A sulfone active against a wide range of bacteria but mainly employed for its actions against mycobacterium leprae. Its mechanism of action is probably similar to that of the sulfonamides which involves inhibition of folic acid synthesis in susceptible organisms. As an anti-infective agent, it is also used for treating malaria and, recently, for Pneumocystic carinii pneumonia in AIDS patients. Dapsone is absorbed rapidly and nearly completely from the gastrointestinal tract. Dapsone is distributed throughout total body water and is present in all tissues."
185,DB00252,"Injectable phenytoin and , which is the phosphate ester prodrug formulation of phenytoin, are indicated to treat tonic-clonic status epilepticus, and for the prevention and treatment of seizures occurring during neurosurgery.Phenytoin is classified as a hydantoin derivative and despite its narrow therapeutic index, it is one of the most commonly used anticonvulsants. Since it's introduction about 80 years ago, phenytoin has not only been established as an effective anti-epileptic, but has also been investigated for several other indications such as bipolar disorder, retina protection, and wound healing. Although the recommended therapeutic range is cited to be between 10-20 mg/L, differences in albumin levels, genetics, comorbidities, and body composition can make achieving an ideal phenytoin dose challenging. For example, studies have confirmed that phenytoin metabolism is impacted by CYP2C9 genotype polymorphisms and possibly by CYP2C19 genotype polymorphisms (the latter has not been as extensively studied). Although phenytoin first appeared in the literature in 1946, it has taken decades for the mechanism of action to be more specifically elucidated."

In patients with increased intraocular pressure and in those susceptible to a rise in intraocular pressure, there is less effect on pressure with medrysone than with dexamethasone or betamethasone. Corticoidsteroids inhibit the edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, and phagocytic migration of the acute inflammatory response, as well as capillary proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation.There is no generally accepted explanation for the mechanism of action of ocular corticosteroids. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid."

Doxycycline is used to treat a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections. It is also used to treat acne and malaria.Doxycycline and other tetracyclines are mainly bacteriostatic and are thought to exert antimicrobial effects by the inhibition of protein synthesis. Doxycycline inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by allosterically binding to the 30S prokaryotic ribosomal subunit. Doxycycline ultimately impedes the elongation phase of protein synthesis and halts the production of essential proteins for bacterial survival and functioning.
188,DB00255,"Used in the treatment of prostate cancer. According to the Fourth Annual Report on Carcinogens (NTP 85-002, 1985), diethylstilbestrol has been listed as a known carcinogen. In 1971, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a Drug Bulletin advising physicians to stop prescribing DES to pregnant women because it was linked to a rare vaginal cancer in female offspring.Estrogens diffuse into their target cells and interact with a protein receptor, the estrogen receptor. The effect of Estrogen binding their receptors causes downstream increases the hepatic synthesis of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), thyroid-binding globulin (TBG), and other serum proteins and suppress follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary. The combination of an estrogen with a progestin suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary system, decreasing the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)."
189,DB00256,"Some of the infections that can be treated with lymecycline include upper respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, bronchitis, chlamydial infections, and rickettsial infections.Lymecycline is a broad-spectrum second-generation tetracycline antibiotic used for the treatment of acne and other susceptible bacterial infections. Lymecycline was initially discovered in 1961. Lymecycline is not marketed in the USA, however, equivalent drugs are available, such as minocycline and .Lymecycline, like other tetracyclines, exerts bacteriostatic actions on intracellular and extracellular bacteria, treating susceptible bacterial infections. It has been shown to be safe and effective in the  treatment of moderate to severe acne. It is not recommended to administer this drug in patients with renal disease or severe hepatic disease.Normally, the ribosome synthesizes proteins through the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex."
190,DB00257,"It is also indicated as a prophylactic drug to reduce the incidence of oropharyngeal candidiasis in patients immunocompromised by conditions such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or steroid therapy utilized in the treatment of leukemia, solid tumors, or renal transplantation . Troche preparations are not indicated for the treatment of any systemic mycoses .This drug is a broad spectrum antimycotic or antifungal agent. Clotrimazole causes inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis, an essential constituent of fungal cell membranes. If ergosterol synthesis is either completely or partially inhibited, the cell is no longer able to construct an intact and functional cell membrane ,. Though decreased ergosterol, due to the inhibition of lanosterol 14-demethylase (also known as _CYP51_)  is accepted to be primarily responsible for the antimycotic properties of clotrimazole, this drug also shows other pharmacological effects."
191,DB00258,"Calcium acetate is one of a number of calcium salts used to treat hyperphosphatemia (too much phosphate in the blood) in patients with kidney disease.The chemical compound calcium acetate is the calcium salt of acetic acid. It has been commonly referred to as the acetate of lime. The anhydrous form is very hygroscopic, therefore the monohydrate is the common form.Patients with advanced renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min) exhibit phosphate retention and some degree of hyperphosphatemia. The rate of removal of phosphate by dietary manipulation or by dialysis is insufficient. Dialysis patients absorb 40% to 80% of dietary phosphorus."
192,DB00259,"For the treatment of vulvovaginitis caused by Candida albicans.Sulfanilamide is a molecule containing the sulfonamide functional group attached to an aniline.Sulfanilamide is a sulfonamide antibiotic. Sulfonamides inhibit multiplication of bacteria by acting as competitive inhibitors of p-aminobenzoic acid in the folic acid metabolism cycle. Bacterial sensitivity is the same for the various sulfonamides, and resistance to one sulfonamide indicates resistance to all. However, parenteral administration is difficult, since the soluble sulfonamide salts are highly alkaline and irritating to the tissues. The inhibited reaction is normally necessary in these organisms for the synthesis of folic acid."
193,DB00260,"Antibiotic substance produced by Streptomyces garyphalus.Cycloserine, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, may be bactericidal or bacteriostatic, depending on its concentration at the site of infection and the susceptibility of the organism. Cycloserine works by blocking the formation of these peptidoglycans. By doing this the walls of the bacteria become weak and it results in the death of the bacteriaCycloserine is an analog of the amino acid D-alanine. It interferes with an early step in bacterial cell wall synthesis in the cytoplasm by competitive inhibition of two enzymes, L-alanine racemase, which forms D-alanine from L-alanine, and D-alanylalanine synthetase, which incorporates D-alanine into the pentapeptide necessary for peptidoglycan formation and bacterial cell wall synthesis."
194,DB00261,"Anagrelide is indicated for the treatment of thrombocythemia, secondary to malignant neoplasms, to reduce platelet count and the associated risk of thrombosis. It is an oral imidazoquinazoline that was first approved for use in the US in 1997. It appears to carry a better response rate than other thrombocythemia treatments (e.g. , ) and may be better tolerated.Anagrelide decreases platelet counts by suppressing transcription factors necessary for the synthesis and maturation of platelet-producing cells. The drug itself appears to have a relatively short residence time in the body necessitating twice or four times daily dosing. Evidence from animal studies suggests anagrelide may impair female fertility."
195,DB00262,"It is used in the treatment of brain tumors and various other malignant neoplasms. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p462) This substance may reasonably be anticipated to be a carcinogen according to the Fourth Annual Report on Carcinogens (NTP 85-002, 1985). (From Merck Index, 11th ed)Carmustine is one of the nitrosoureas indicated as palliative therapy as a single agent or in established combination therapy with other approved chemotherapeutic agents in treatment of brain tumors, multiple myeloma, Hodgkin's disease, and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Carmustine also binds to and modifies (carbamoylates) glutathione reductase. This leads to cell death."

The sulfonamides are synthetic bacteriostatic antibiotics with a wide spectrum against most gram-positive and many gram-negative organisms. However, many strains of an individual species may be resistant. Bacterial sensitivity is the same for the various sulfonamides, and resistance to one sulfonamide indicates resistance to all. Their antibacterial action is inhibited by pus.Sulfisoxazole is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase."
197,DB00264,"Metoprolol is indicated for the treatment of angina, heart failure, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter and hypertension. Some off-label uses of metoprolol include supraventricular tachycardia and thyroid storm. All the indications of metoprolol are part of cardiovascular diseases. These conditions correspond to a number of diseases that involve the function of the heart and blood vessels. As well, in clinical trials performed in 1990, metoprolol reduces mortality and re-infarction in 17% of the individuals when administered chronically after an episode of myocardial infarction.Metoprolol is a beta-1-adrenergic receptor inhibitor specific to cardiac cells with negligible effect on beta-2 receptors."
198,DB00266,"It is used as an oral anticoagulant and acts by inhibiting the hepatic synthesis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors (prothrombin and factors VII, IX, and X). Dicumarol inhibits vitamin K reductase, resulting in depletion of the reduced form of vitamin K (vitamin KH2). The synthesis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X and anticoagulant proteins C and S is inhibited. Depression of three of the four vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors (factors II, VII, and X) results in decresed prothrombin levels and a decrease in the amount of thrombin generated and bound to fibrin. This reduces the thrombogenicity of clots."
199,DB00267,"Used to treat female gynecologic and obstetric infections caused by susceptible aerobic (including the gonococcus) and anaerobic bacteria.Cefmenoxime is a novel broad-spectrum and third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic that is typically used in the treatment of female gynecologic and obstetric infections. It is reported to exhibit high activity against a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.Cefmenoxime is a semisynthetic beta-lactam cephalosporin antibiotic with activity similar to that of cefotaxime. It has broad spectrum activity against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria.The bactericidal activity of cefmenoxime results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Cefmenoxime is stable in the presence of a variety of b-lactamases, including penicillinases and some cephalosporinases."
200,DB00268,"For the treatment of the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease and for the treatment of primary moderate-severe restless legs syndrome .Ropinirole, also known as _ReQuip_, is a non-ergoline dopamine agonist used in Parkinson's disease and restless legs syndrome , . **Effects on Parkinson's and restless leg syndrome**    This drug promotes the relief or improvement of symptoms of Parkinson's or restless leg syndrome by stimulatory actions on dopamine receptors, which regulate movement. **Effects on QT interval**    Ropinirole had no dose- or exposure-related effect on average QT intervals in healthy male and female volunteers at doses up to 4 mg/day. The exact mechanism of action of ropinirole as a treatment for Parkinsonâs disease is unknown, however, it is believed to be related to its ability to selectively stimulate dopamine D2 receptors within the caudate-putamen system in the brain. Ropinirole has no affinity at the D1-like receptors, benzodiazepine or GABA receptors ."
201,DB00270,"Isradipine binds to calcium channels with high affinity and specificity and inhibits calcium flux into cardiac and arterial smooth muscle cells. It exhibits greater selectivity towards arterial smooth muscle cells owing to alternative splicing of the alpha-1 subunit of the channel and increased prevalence of inactive channels in smooth muscle cells. Isradipine may be used to treat mild to moderate essential hypertension.Isradipine decreases arterial smooth muscle contractility and subsequent vasoconstriction by inhibiting the influx of calcium ions through L-type calcium channels. Isradipine belongs to the dihydropyridine (DHP) class of calcium channel blockers (CCBs), the most widely used class of CCBs. Since arterial smooth muscle depolarizations are longer in duration than cardiac muscle depolarizations, inactive channels are more prevalent in smooth muscle cells."
202,DB00271,"It can be used for imaging the gastrointestinal tract in patients allergic to barium.A commonly used x-ray contrast medium. As diatrizoate meglumine and as Diatrizoate sodium, it is used for gastrointestinal studies, angiography, and urography.Diatrizoate is the most commonly used water-soluble, iodinated, radiopaque x-ray contrast medium. They contain iodine, which blocks x-rays. The resulting high level of iodine allows the x-rays to make a ""picture"" of the area. The areas of the body in which the radiopaque agent localizes will appear white on the x-ray film."
203,DB00273,"Topiramate is indicated  for the following conditions: 1)Monotherapy for partial onset or primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures for patients 2 years of age and above 2)Adjunctive therapy for partial onset seizures or primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures for both adult and pediatric patients above 2 years old 3)Adjunctive therapy for seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in patients above 2 years of age 4)Prophylaxis of migraine in children 12 years of age and older and adults. Topiramate is also used off-label as an adjunct therapy for weight management and for mood disorders.Topiramate is a anti-epileptic drug used to manage seizures and prevent migraines. In 2004, topiramate was approved for the prevention of migraine in adults. A seizure is an abnormal and unregulated electrical discharge occurring in the brain. Topiramate has been observed to exert actions on voltage-dependent sodium channels, GABA receptors, and glutamate receptors."
204,DB00274,"For the treatment of infections caused by susceptible organisms.A semisynthetic cephamycin antibiotic with a broad spectrum of activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. It has a high rate of efficacy in many types of infection and to date no severe side effects have been noted.Cefmetazole is a second-generation cephalosporin. The cephalosporins are bactericidal drugs with both gram-positive and gram-negative activity. They inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis in a way similar to the penicillins. Cefmetazole is more active than 1st-generation cephalosporins against indole-positive Proteus,Serratia, anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (including B. fragilis), and some E. coli, Klebsiella, and P. mirabilis, but is less active than cefoxitin or cefotetan against most gram-negative bacilli.The bactericidal activity of cefmetazole results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs)."
205,DB00275,"ARBs selectively bind to angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1) and prevent the protein angiotensin II from binding and exerting its hypertensive effects, which include vasoconstriction, stimulation and synthesis of aldosterone and ADH, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium, among others. **Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients**    In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, such as volume-and/or salt-depleted patients (e.g., those being treated with high doses of diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may be anticipated after initiation of treatment with olmesartan. In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system (e.g., patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and rarely with acute renal failure and/or death. There has been no long-term use of olmesartan medoxomil in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but similar results may be expected. ARBs selectively bind to angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1) and prevent the protein angiotensin II from binding and exerting its hypertensive effects."

207,DB00277,"For the treatment of the symptoms and reversible airflow obstruction associated with chronic asthma and other chronic lung diseases, such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis.A methylxanthine derivative from tea with diuretic, smooth muscle relaxant, bronchial dilation, cardiac and central nervous system stimulant activities. Mechanistically, theophylline acts as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, adenosine receptor blocker, and histone deacetylase activator. Theophylline is marketed under several brand names such as Uniphyl and Theochron, and it is indicated mainly for asthma, bronchospasm, and COPD.Theophylline, an xanthine derivative chemically similar to caffeine and theobromine, is used to treat asthma and bronchospasm. Theophylline has two distinct actions in the airways of patients with reversible (asthmatic) obstruction; smooth muscle relaxation (i.e., bronchodilation) and suppression of the response of the airways to stimuli (i.e., non-bronchodilator prophylactic effects).Theophylline relaxes the smooth muscle of the bronchial airways and pulmonary blood vessels and reduces airway responsiveness to histamine, methacholine, adenosine, and allergen. Theophylline competitively inhibits type III and type IV phosphodiesterase (PDE), the enzyme responsible for breaking down cyclic AMP in smooth muscle cells, possibly resulting in bronchodilation."
208,DB00278,"It is also indicated for use in patients with, or at risk for, HIT who are undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.Argatroban is a direct, selective thrombin inhibitor. Parental anticoagulants must be stopped and a baseline activated partial thromboplastin time must be obtained prior to administering argatroban.Argatroban is a synthetic direct thrombin inhibitor derived from L-arginine indicated as an anticoagulant for prophylaxis or treatment of thrombosis in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Argatroban does not require the co-factor antithrombin III for antithrombotic activity. Argatroban is highly selective for thrombin with an inhibitory constant (K<sub>i</sub>) of 0.04 &micro;M. At therapeutic concentrations, Argatroban has little or no effect on related serine proteases (trypsin, factor Xa, plasmin, and kallikrein). Argatroban is capable of inhibiting the action of both free and clot-associated thrombin.Argatroban exerts its anticoagulant effects by inhibiting thrombin-catalyzed or -induced reactions, including fibrin formation; activation of coagulation factors V, VIII, and XIII; protein C; and platelet aggregation."
209,DB00279,"- As an adjunct therapy to surgery and radioiodine in the management of thyroid cancer. - As a diagnostic agent in suppression tests for mild hyperthyroidism or thyroid gland autonomy. In general terms, exogenous liothyronine is used to replace insufficient hormonal production and restore T3 plasma levels. Liothyronine should never be used in the suppression of benign nodules and nontoxic diffuse goiter in iodine-sufficient patients nor in the treatment of hyperthyroidism during the recovery phase of subacute thyroiditis.Liothyronine is a thyroidal hormone T3 which is normally produced by the thyroid gland in a ratio 4:1 when compared with T4: T3. Treatment with liothyronine has been shown to produce normal plasma levels of T3 hormone but to have no effect on the T4 plasma concentration.Liothyronine replaces endogenous thyroid hormone and then exerts its physiologic effects by controlling DNA transcription and protein synthesis."
210,DB00280,"For the treatment of documented ventricular arrhythmias, such as sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular pre-excitation and cardiac dysrhythmias. It is a Class Ia antiarrhythmic drug.A class I anti-arrhythmic agent (one that interferes directly with the depolarization of the cardiac membrane and thus serves as a membrane-stabilizing agent) with a depressant action on the heart similar to that of guanidine. It also possesses some anticholinergic and local anesthetic properties.Disopyramide is an anti-arrhythmic drug indicated for the treatment of documented ventricular arrhythmias, such as sustained ventricular tachycardia that are life-threatening. At therapeutic plasma levels, disopyramide shortens the sinus node recovery time, lengthens the effective refractory period of the atrium, and has a minimal effect on the effective refractory period of the AV node. Little effect has been shown on AV-nodal and His-Purkinje conduction times or QRS duration."
211,DB00281,"In particular, lidocaine's principal mode of action in acting as a local anesthetic that numbs the sensations of tissues means the agent is indicated for facilitating local anesthesia for a large variety of surgical procedures . As a result, lidocaine is also considered a class Ib anti-arrhythmic agent . With central neural blockade these changes may be attributable to the block of autonomic fibers, a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system, and/or the beta-adrenergic receptor stimulating action of epinephrine when present . In particular, such cardiac effects are likely associated with the principal effect that lidocaine elicits when it binds and blocks sodium channels, inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of electrical action potential impulses necessary to facilitate muscle contraction . Subsequently, in cardiac myocytes, lidocaine can potentially block or otherwise slow the rise of cardiac action potentials and their associated cardiac myocyte contractions, resulting in possible effects like hypotension, bradycardia, myocardial depression, cardiac arrhythmias, and perhaps cardiac arrest or circulatory collapse ."
212,DB00282,"Pamidronic acid was first described in the literature in 1977. Pamidronic acid was granted FDA approval on 31 October 1991.Pamidronic acid is a second generation, nitrogen containing bisphosphonate that inhibits osteoclast mediated bone loss It has a wide therapeutic index and a long duration of action as it can be given every 3-4 weeks for certain indications. Bone resorption by osteoclasts causes local acidification, releasing the bisphosphonate, which is taken into the osteoclast by fluid-phase endocytosis. Disruption of the podosomes causes osteoclasts to detach from bones, preventing bone resorption. The lack of prenylation of these proteins interferes with their function, and in the case of Rap1, leads to apoptosis."
213,DB00283,"Used as self-medication for temporary relief of symptoms associated with the common cold.An ethanolamine-derivative, first generation histamine H1 antagonist used in hay fever, rhinitis, allergic skin conditions, and pruritus. It causes drowsiness.Clemastine is an antihistamine that also induces anticholinergic and sedative effects. Antihistamines competitively antagonize various physiological effects of histamine including increased capillary permeability and dilatation, the formation of edema, the ""flare"" and ""itch"" response, and gastrointestinal and respiratory smooth muscle constriction. Within the vascular tree, H1- receptor antagonists inhibit both the vasoconstrictor and vasodilator effects of histamine. Depending on the dose, H1- receptor antagonists can produce CNS stimulation or depression."
214,DB00284,"Acarbose is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.Acarbose is a complex oligosaccharide that acts as an inhibitor of several enzymes responsible for the breakdown of complex carbohydrates in the intestines. It inhibits both pancreatic alpha-amylase and membrane-bound alpha-glucosidases - including intestinal glucoamylase, sucrase, maltase, and isomaltase - which are responsible for the metabolism of complex starches and oligo-, tri-, and disaccharides into absorbable simple sugars. Acarbose is one of only two approved alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (the other being ), receiving its first FDA approval in 1995 under the brand name Precose (since discontinued). This class of antidiabetic therapy is not widely used due to their relatively modest impact on A1c, their requirement for thrice-daily dosing, and the potential for significant gastrointestinal adverse effects.Acarbose is a complex oligosaccharide that competitively inhibits the ability of brush-border alpha-glucosidase enzymes to break down ingested carbohydrates into absorbable monosaccharides, reducing carbohydrate absorption and subsequent postprandial insulin levels. There have been rare post-marketing reports of the development of pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis following treatment with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors - patients experiencing significant diarrhea/constipation, mucus discharge, and/or rectal bleeding should be investigated and, if pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis is suspected, should discontinue therapy.Alpha-glucosidase enzymes are located in the brush-border of the intestinal mucosa and serve to metabolize oligo-, tri-, and disaccharides (e.g. sucrose) into smaller monosaccharides (e.g. glucose, fructose) which are more readily absorbed."

Its active metabolite, , works by blocking the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, which are key neurotransmitters in mood regulation. The immediate formulation of the drug, marketed as Effexor, was first approved by the FDA in 1993 and the extended-release formulation, Effexor XR, was later introduced in 1997. Venlafaxine was also investigated in off-label uses for the prophylaxis of migraine headaches, for reduction of vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause, and for the management of neuropathic pain (although there is only minimal evidence of efficacy for this condition).Venlafaxine is an antidepressant agent that works to ameliorate the symptoms of various psychiatric disorders by increasing the level of neurotransmitters in the synapse. Venlafaxine does not mediate muscarinic, histaminergic, or adrenergic effects.The exact mechanism of action of venlafaxine in the treatment of various psychiatric conditions has not been fully elucidated; however, it is understood that venlafaxine and its active metabolite O-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV) potently and selectively inhibits the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine at the presynaptic terminal."
216,DB00286,"- Treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy due to menopause. The conjugated estrogens are noncrystalline mixtures of purified female sex hormones obtained either by its isolation from the urine of pregnant mares or by synthetic generation from vegetal material. The currently approved product of conjugated estrogens was developed by Wyeth Ayerst and FDA approved in 2003.The binding of estrogens to the estrogen receptor produces the activation of nuclear receptors in order to bind to estrogen response elements in certain target genes. It has also been tested and confirmed that conjugated estrogens present a selective estrogen receptor modulator profile which allows it to have a large beneficial effect on the bone and cardiovascular system. In the hormonal area, it is shown to inhibit luteinizing hormone and decrease the serum concentration of testosterone.The conjugated estrogens, equally to the normal physiological estrogen, work by agonistically binding to the estrogen receptors alpha and beta."
217,DB00287,"Travoprost is indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Unlike other prostaglandin analogues, travoprost demonstrates full agonism and high selectivity at the prostanoid receptor, reporting a higher efficacy in reducing intraocular pressure and a reduced risk for developing off-target side effects.Travoprost demonstrates preferential affinity and full agonist activity for the prostaglandin FP receptor in the nanomolar range. Significant lowering of intraocular pressure can be maintained for periods exceeding 24 hours with a single dose.Travoprost is a prodrug. Upon administration, travoprost is absorbed through the cornea and hydrolyzed to its active metabolite, travoprost free acid. By binding to the FP receptor, travoprost free acid increases the outflow of aqueous humour via the trabecular meshwork and uveoscleral pathways, thereby reducing the intraocular pressure."
218,DB00288,"The topical corticosteroids constitute a class of primarily synthetic steroids used as anti-inflammatory and antipruritic agents. Amcinonide reduces or inhibits the actions of chemicals in the body that cause inflammation, redness, and swelling. There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in man. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2."
219,DB00289,"This is beneficial in the treatment of ADHD as DA activation in the subcortical NA and striatum is associated with many stimulant-associated side effects and an increase in abuse potential, which is a limiting factor associated with the use of stimulant medications such as , , and . Concerns about abuse potential have spurred research into medications with fewer effects on DA and the use of non-stimulant ADHD medications including atomoxetine,  and . The non-stimulant norepinephrine/dopamine reuptake inhibitor  (commonly used for the treatment of depression and for smoking cessation) has also been shown to be effective in the treatment of ADHD.Atomoxetine is a selective norepinephrine (NE) reuptake inhibitor used for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Atomoxetine should be used with caution in patients whose underlying medical conditions could be worsened by increases in blood pressure or heart rate such as certain patients with hypertension, tachycardia, or cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. Atomoxetine should be discontinued in patients with jaundice or laboratory evidence of liver injury, and should not be restarted."

It inhibits DNA metabolism and is used as an antineoplastic, especially for solid tumors. Bleomycin A2 is used as the representative structure for Bleomycin.Bleomycin is an antibiotic which has been shown to have antitumor activity. The guanine and cytosine content correlates with the degree of mitomycin-induced cross-linking. The antibiotic antitumor drugs are cell cycle-nonspecific except for Bleomycin (which has major effects in G2 and M phases).Although the exact mechanism of action of bleomycin is unknown, available evidence would seem to indicate that the main mode of action is the inhibition of DNA synthesis with some evidence of lesser inhibition of RNA and protein synthesis."

Although it is less toxic than most other nitrogen mustards, it has been listed as a known carcinogen in the Fourth Annual Report on Carcinogens (NTP 85-002, 1985). (Merck Index, 11th ed)Chlorambucil is an antineoplastic in the class of alkylating agents that is used to treat various forms of cancer. Alkylating agents are so named because of their ability to add alkyl groups to many electronegative groups under conditions present in cells. Alkylating agents work by three different mechanisms all of which achieve the same end result - disruption of DNA function and cell death.Alkylating agents work by three different mechanisms: 1) attachment of alkyl groups to DNA bases, resulting in the DNA being fragmented by repair enzymes in their attempts to replace the alkylated bases, preventing DNA synthesis and RNA transcription from the affected DNA, 2) DNA damage via the formation of cross-links (bonds between atoms in the DNA) which prevents DNA from being separated for synthesis or transcription, and 3) the induction of mispairing of the nucleotides leading to mutations."

The first product including etonogestrel was developed by the Merck subsidiary Organon and FDA approved in 2001.Etonogestrel attains its therapeutic effect inhibiting fertility by impairing the release of the luteinizing hormone which is one of the most important reproductive hormones for ovulation. Fertility was established quickly with 20 reported pregnancies within 3 months of implant removal. The implants of etonogestrel release 40 mcg of etonogestrel daily and they usually provide a continuous contraception effect for 3 years. When the implant is administered, the failure rate is reported to be 0.1%."
225,DB00295,"Morphine is used for the management of chronic, moderate to severe pain. Opiods, including morphine, are effective for the short term management of pain. Patients taking opioids long term may need to be monitored for the development of physical dependence, addiction disorder, and drug abuse.Morphine, the main alkaloid of opium, was first obtained from poppy seeds in 1805. It is a potent analgesic, though its use is limited due to tolerance, withdrawal, and the risk of abuse. Morphine was granted FDA approval in 1941.Morphine binding to opioid receptors blocks transmission of nociceptive signals, signals pain-modulating neurons in the spinal cord, and inhibits primary afferent nociceptors to the dorsal horn sensory projection cells."

It exists as a racemate of its S- and R-enantiomers, although the marketed form is supplied only as the purified S-enantiomer.In contrast to most other local anesthetics, the presence of  does not affect the time of onset, duration of action, or the systemic absorption of ropivacaine.Local anesthetics like ropivacaine block the generation and conduction of nerve impulses, presumably by increasing the threshold for electrical excitation in the nerve, by slowing the propagation of the nerve impulse, and by reducing the rate of rise of the action potential. Specifically, they block the sodium channel and decrease chances of depolarization and consequent action potentials. In general, the progression of anesthesia is related to the diameter, myelination, and conduction velocity of affected nerve fibers."
227,DB00297,"Bupivacaine is indicated for postsurgical analgesia in adult patients for up to 72 hours following foot and ankle, small-to-medium open abdominal, and lower extremity total joint arthroplasty surgical procedures. Bupivacaine, alone or in combination with , is indicated in adults for the production of local or regional anesthesia or analgesia for surgery, dental and oral surgery procedures, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, and for obstetrical procedures. In comparison to other local anesthetics it has a long duration of action. This problem has led to the use of other long-acting local anaesthetics:ropivacaine and levobupivacaine. Following systemic absorption, local anesthetics can produce central nervous system stimulation, depression or both.Like , bupivacaine is an amide local anesthetic that provides local anesthesia through blockade of nerve impulse generation and conduction."
228,DB00298,"Used in the treatment of iatrogenically induced mydriasis produced by adrenergic (phenylephrine) or parasympatholytic (tropicamide) agents used in certain eye examinations.Dapiprazole (U.S. trade name Rev-Eyes) is an alpha blocker. It is found in ophthalmic solutions used to reverse mydriasis after an eye examination.Dapiprazole is an alpha-adrenergic blocking agent. It produces miosis by blocking the alpha-adrenergic receptors on the dilator muscle of the iris. The rate of pupillary constriction may be slightly slower in clients with brown irises than in clients with blue or green irises.Dapiprazole acts through blocking the alpha1-adrenergic receptors in smooth muscle. It produces miosis through an effect on the dilator muscle of the iris and does not have any significant activity on ciliary muscle contraction and, therefore does not induce a significant change in the anterior chamber depth or the thickness of the lens."
229,DB00299,"The activated drug inhibits the viral DNA polymerase. In cells infected with HSV-1 or HSV-2, viral thymidine kinase phosphorylates penciclovir to a monophosphate form. The intracellular triphosphate of penciclovir is retained <i>in vitro</i> inside HSV-infected cells for 10-20 hours, compared with 0.7-1 hour for acyclovir. <i>in vitro</i> studies show that penciclovir triphosphate selectively inhibits viral DNA polymerase by competing with deoxyguanosine triphosphate. Resistant mutants of HSV can occur from qualitative changes in viral thymidine kinase or DNA polymerase."

231,DB00301,"Used to treat bacterial infection by susceptible microorganisms.Antibiotic analog of .Flucloxacillin is a penicillin beta-lactam antibiotic used in the treatment of bacterial infections caused by susceptible, usually gram-positive, organisms. The name ""penicillin"" can either refer to several variants of penicillin available, or to the group of antibiotics derived from the penicillins. Flucloxacillin has <i>in vitro</i> activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The bactericidal activity of Flucloxacillin results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis and is mediated through flucloxacillin binding to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). Flucloxacillin is stable against hydrolysis by a variety of beta-lactamases, including penicillinases, and cephalosporinases and extended spectrum beta-lactamases.By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, flucloxacillin inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis."
232,DB00302,"Taken orally, tranexamic acid is indicated for the treatment of hereditary angioedema, cyclic heavy menstrual bleeding in premenopausal females, and other instances of significant bleeding in the context of hyperfibrinolysis. It possesses a similar mechanism of action to  but is approximately 10-fold more potent. At much higher concentrations it behaves as a noncompetitive inhibitor of plasmin similar to , a similar antifibrinolytic which is 10-fold less potent. Tranexamic acid binds more strongly than aminocaproic acid to both the strong and weak receptor sites of the plasminogen molecule in a ratio corresponding to the difference in potency between the compounds. Consider EEG monitoring of patients with a history of seizure.Tranexamic acid competitively and reversibly inhibits the activation of plasminogen via binding at several distinct sites, including four or five low-affinity sites and one high-affinity site, the latter of which is involved in its binding to fibrin."

238,DB00308,"Indicated for the rapid conversion of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter of recent onset to sinus rhythm.Ibutilide is a Class III antiarrhythmic agent available in intravenous formulations. It is indicated for the conversion of acute atrial flutter and recent onset atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm (NSR).Ibutilide prolongs the action potential duration and increases both atrial and ventricular refractoriness in vivo, i.e., class III electrophysiologic effects. Voltage clamp studies indicate that ibutilide, at nanomolar concentrations, delays repolarization by activation of a slow, inward current (predominantly sodium), rather than by blocking outward potassium currents, which is the mechanism by which most other class III antiarrhythmics act.Ibutilide is a 'pure' class III antiarrhythmic drug, used intravenously against atrial flutter and fibrillation. At a cellular level it exerts two main actions: induction of a persistent Na+ current sensitive to dihydropyridine Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blockers and potent inhibition of the cardiac rapid delayed rectifier K<sup>+</sup> current, by binding within potassium channel pores. In other words, Ibutilide binds to and alters the activity of hERG potassium channels, delayed inward rectifier potassium (IKr) channels and L-type (dihydropyridine sensitive) calcium channels"

Major side effects are myelosuppression and neurotoxicity. Vindesine is used extensively in chemotherapy protocols (antineoplastic combined chemotherapy protocols).Vindesine is indicated for the treatment of acute lymphocytic leukemia of childhood that is resistant to vincristine and non-oat cell lung cancer. Vindesine causes the arrest of cells in metaphase mitosis. Unlike vinblastine, vindesine produces very few postmetaphase cells."
240,DB00310,"Chlorthalidone has also been found useful in edema due to various forms of renal dysfunction, such as nephrotic syndrome, acute glomerulonephritis, and chronic renal failure.Chlorthalidone is a thiazide-like diuretic used for the treatment of hypertension and for management of edema caused by conditions such as heart failure or renal impairment. Chlorthalidone is considered first-line therapy for management of uncomplicated hypertension as there is strong evidence from meta-analyses that thiazide diuretics such as chlorthalidone reduce the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and cardiovascular all-cause mortality in patients with hypertension. Chlorthalidone has been shown to have a number of pleiotropic effects that differentiate it from other diuretics such as . These pathways may play a role in chlorthalidone's cardiovascular risk reduction effects.Chlorthalidone prevents reabsorption of sodium and chloride through inhibition of the Na+/Cl- symporter in the cortical diluting segment of the ascending limb of the loop of Henle. Reduction of sodium reabsorption subsequently reduces extracellular fluid and plasma volume via an osmotic, sodium-driven diuresis."
241,DB00312,"For the short-term treatment of insomnia.A short-acting barbiturate that is effective as a sedative and hypnotic (but not as an anti-anxiety) agent and is usually given orally. It is prescribed more frequently for sleep induction than for sedation but, like similar agents, may lose its effectiveness by the second week of continued administration. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1994, p236)Pentobarbital, a barbiturate, is used for the treatment of short term insomnia. It belongs to a group of medicines called central nervous system (CNS) depressants that induce drowsiness and relieve tension or nervousness. Little analgesia is conferred by barbiturates; their use in the presence of pain may result in excitation.Pentobarbital binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl- ionopore at the GABAA receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl- ionopore is open."

It is also thought that valproate exerts a neuroprotective effect preventing damage and neural degeneration in epilepsy, migraines, and bipolar disorder. The FDA labeling contains a warning regarding HIV reactivation during valproate use..The exact mechanisms by which valproate exerts it's effects on epilepsy, migraine headaches, and bipolar disorder are unknown however several pathways exist which may contribute to the drug's action. The inhibition of the PKC pathway may also be a contributor to migraine prophylaxis. Histone hyperacetylation at the BDNF gene, increasing BDNF expression, post-seizure is known to occur and is thought to be a neuroprotective mechanism which valproate may strengthen or prolong."
243,DB00314,"Used in the treatment of tuberculosis in combination with other drugs.Cyclic peptide antibiotic similar to viomycin. It is produced by Streptomyces capreolus.Capreomycin is a member of the aminoglycoside family of antibiotics. These antibiotics have the ability to kill a wide variety of bacteria, including bacteria responsible for causing tuberculosis (TB).Little is known about capreomycin's exact mechanism of action, but it is thought to inhibit protein synthesis by binding to the 70S ribosomal unit. Capreomycin also binds to components in the bacterial cell which result in the production of abnormal proteins. Therefore the production of these abnormal proteins is ultimately fatal to the bacteria."
244,DB00315,"Zolmitriptan is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without auras in patients aged 18 and over.Zolmitriptan is a member of the triptan class of 5-hydroxytryptamine(5-HT)1B/1D/(1F) receptor agonists used to treat acute migraine. It is through the downstream effects of 5-HT1B/1D activation that triptans are proposed to provide acute relief of migraines. In addition, neurological deficits, collectively termed migraine aura, may precede the headache phase. The head pain associated with migraine is thought to be a consequence of activation of the nociceptive nerves comprising the trigeminocervical complex (TCC). Although triptans are classically described solely in terms of their effects on 5-HT1B/1D receptors, they also act as 5-HT1F agonists as well."
245,DB00316,"In general, acetaminophen is used for the treatment of mild to moderate pain and reduction of fever. It is available over the counter in various forms, the most common being oral forms. As opposed to the _salicylate_ drug class, acetaminophen does not disrupt tubular secretion of uric acid and does not affect acid-base balance if taken at the recommended doses. According to its FDA labeling, acetaminophen's exact mechanism of action has not been fully established - despite this, it is often categorized alongside NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) due to its ability to inhibit the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathways. Acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, therefore, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory effects."
246,DB00317,"For the continued treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after failure of either platinum-based or docetaxel chemotherapies.Gefitinib (originally coded ZD1839) is a drug used in the treatment of certain types of cancer. Acting in a similar manner to erlotinib (marketed as Tarceva), gefitinib selectively targets the mutant proteins in malignant cells. EGFR is expressed on the cell surface of many normal cells and cancer cells.Gefitinib is an inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase that binds to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding site of the enzyme. EGFR is often shown to be overexpressed in certain human carcinoma cells, such as lung and breast cancer cells. By inhibiting EGFR tyrosine kinase, the downstream signaling cascades are also inhibited, resulting in inhibited malignant cell proliferation."
247,DB00318,"Codeine, an opioid analgesic, was originally approved in the US in 1950 and is a drug used to decrease pain by increasing the threshold for pain without impairing consciousness or altering other sensory functions. **Effects on intestinal motility**    Codeine may reduce intestinal motility through both a local and possibly central mechanism of action . **Effects on the central nervous system**    Codeine phosphate is an opioid analgesic with uses similar to those of morphine, but is much less potent as an analgesic. **Effects on chronic cancer pain and other types of pain**    Codeine is an opioid analgesic with similar indications to those of morphine, however, is much less potent in its pain alleviating properties. Other hypotheses also postulate that codeine-6-glucuronide, the main metabolite of codeine, mediates the analgesic effect of codeine as it not only has an affinity to the mu receptors as codeine but also can be metabolized to morphine-6-glucuronide, which was observed to be more potent than morphine."
248,DB00319,"For the treatment of polymicrobial infections.Semisynthetic, broad-spectrum, ampicillin derived ureidopenicillin antibiotic proposed for pseudomonas infections. Piperacillin has <i>in vitro</i> activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The bactericidal activity of Piperacillin results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis and is mediated through Piperacillin binding to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). Piperacillin is stable against hydrolysis by a variety of beta-lactamases, including penicillinases, and cephalosporinases and extended spectrum beta-lactamases.By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, Piperacillin inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that Piperacillin interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."
249,DB00320,"The recently approved Precision Olfactory Delivery technology developed by Impel Neuropharma technology has correlated with an increase of 3-fold in Cmax and 4-fold in AUC despite the solution formulated at 75% of the strength of the existing intranasal product.DHE is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine headaches with or without aura and the acute treatment of cluster headache episodes. It is thought to exert its therapeutic effect through both neurological and vascular mechanisms. The same serotonin agonist activity also contributes to vasoconstriction, producing both the characteristic side effect of chest tightness and potentially contributing to a therapeutic effect by counteracting the vasodilation due to calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) release in migraine attacks.DHE has several proposed mechanisms which may contribute to its therapeutic efficacy as an abortive therapy in migraines. Further action on 5-HT1b and 5-HT1d receptors with the addition of agonist activity on 5-HT1f in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis decreases afferent signalling to trigeminal sensory neurons which contributes to central sensitization. Lastly, action at 5-HT1d receptors on trigeminal nerve terminals inhibits the release of vasoactive neuropeptides thought to contribute to pain and inflammation during a migraine attack."
250,DB00321,"This product should only be prescribed by a healthcare professional with expertise in the management of persistent enuresis     Off-label uses: irritable bowel syndrome, sleep disorders, diabetic neuropathy, agitation, fibromyalgia, and insomnia Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that has been used to treat depression for decades. Amitriptyline has been investigated in the treatment of pain-related conditions, attributed to its analgesic properties. **Effects in pain and depression**    Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant and an analgesic. **Cardiovascular and Anticholinergic Effects**    Amitriptyline has strong anticholinergic properties and may cause ECG changes and quinidine-like effects on the heart . This drug counteracts these mechanisms, and this may be the mechanism of amitriptyline in improving depressive symptoms."
251,DB00322,"For palliative management of gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma metastatic to the liver, when given by continuous regional intra-arterial infusion in carefully selected patients who are considered incurable by surgery or other means. When administered by slow, continuous, intra-arterial infusion, it is converted to floxuridine monophosphate. Floxuridine rapidly undergoes catabolism to form 5-fluorouracil, which is the active component of the drug. 5-Fluorouracil primarily works by interfering with DNA synthesis; however, it may also inhibit the formation of fraudulent RNA via physical incorporation into the RNA. Floxuridine can also form 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-phosphate (FUDR-MP), which is the monophosphate of floxuridine that inhibits thymidylate synthetase that plays a role in the methylation of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid during DNA synthesis."
252,DB00323,"This drug is generally reserved for patients with parkinsonian syndrome receiving levodopa/carbidopa who are experiencing symptom fluctuations and are not responding adequately to or are not candidates for other adjunctive therapies.Tolcapone is a drug that inhibits the enzyme catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT). It is a yellow, odorless, non-hygroscopic, crystalline compound. In humans, COMT is distributed throughout various organs. When tolcapone is given in conjunction with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbidopa, plasma levels of levodopa are more sustained than after administration of levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor alone. It is believed that these sustained plasma levels of levodopa result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, leading to greater effects on the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease in patients as well as increased levodopa adverse effects, sometimes requiring a decrease in the dose of levodopa.The precise mechanism of action of tolcapone is unknown, but it is believed to be related to its ability to inhibit COMT and alter the plasma pharmacokinetics of levodopa, resulting in an increase in plasma levodopa concentrations."
253,DB00324,"For the ophthalmic treatment of corticosteroid-responsive inflammation of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea and anterior segment of the globe.A glucocorticoid employed, usually as eye drops, in the treatment of allergic and inflammatory conditions of the eye. It has also been used topically in the treatment of various skin disorders. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p732)Corticosteroids such as fluorometholone inhibit the inflammatory response to a variety of inciting agents and probably delay or slow healing. They inhibit the edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation associated with inflammation.There is no generally accepted explanation for the mechanism of action of ocular corticosteroids. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2."
254,DB00325,"For immediate reduction of blood pressure of patients in hypertensive crises, reduce bleeding during surgery, and for the treatment of acute congestive heart failureNitroprusside serves as a source of nitric oxide, a potent peripheral vasodilator that affects both arterioles and venules (venules more than arterioles). Nitroprusside is often administered intravenously to patients who are experiencing a hypertensive emergency.Nitroprusside a powerful vasodilator relaxes the vascular smooth muscle and produce consequent dilatation of peripheral arteries and veins. Other smooth muscle (e.g., uterus, duodenum) is not affected. Cyanide binds avidly (but reversibly) to ferric ion (Fe+++), most body stores of which are found in erythrocyte methemoglobin (metHgb) and in mitochondrial cytochromes. When CN is infused or generated within the bloodstream, essentially all of it is bound to methemoglobin until intraerythrocytic methemoglobin has been saturated."

Calcium is also needed for the heart, muscles, and nervous system to work properly.Calcium supplements such as calcium gluceptate are taken by individuals who are unable to get enough calcium in their regular diet or who have a need for more calcium. The body needs calcium to make strong bones. They are continuously giving up calcium to the bloodstream and then replacing it as the body's need for calcium changes from day to day. When there is not enough calcium in the blood to be used by the heart and other organs, your body will take the needed calcium from the bones."
256,DB00327,"Due to its addictive potential and overdose risk, hydromorphone is only prescribed when other first-line treatments have failed. Structurally, hydromorphone derived from  in the modification of the hydroxyl group in the carbon 6 to a carbonyl and the absence of a double bond between the carbon 7 and 8. Due to these modifications, it presents a very high potency and comparable side effect profile to the parent compound. Some of the observed effects of the consumption of hydromorphone for acute pain are complete and longlasting pain relief when compared to other pain relief agents such as , , , , , and . The respiratory depression is known to be caused by the effect on the brain stem respiratory centers as well as to a reduction in the responsiveness of this brain stems to increase carbon dioxide tension.Hydromorphone is an opioid agonist that can bind to different types of opioid receptors."
257,DB00328,"The pharmacological effect of indometacin is not fully understood, however, it is thought to be mediated through potent and nonselective inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), which is the main enzyme responsible for catalyzes the rate-limiting step in prostaglandin and thromboxane biosynthesis via the arachidonic acid (AA) pathway. Since then, indometacin has been extensively studied in clinical trials as one of the most potent NSAIDs in blocking prostaglandin synthesis and was among the first NSAIDs to be used in the symptomatic treatment of migraine and for headaches that eventually became known as âindomethacin-responsiveï¿½?headache disorders. Most commonly used in rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritis, acute shoulder pains, and acute gouty arthritis, indometacin is currently available as oral capsules as well as other methods of administration, including rectal and intravenous formulations. Although deemed effective in reducing ocular inflammation in clinical studies, topical NSAIDs were also associated with a potential reduction in corneal sensitivity accompanied by an increased risk of superficial punctate keratitis and subjective symptoms of discomfort, including pain, burning or pricking, or a tingling sensation after instillation into the culâdeâsac.Indometacin is an NSAID with analgesic and antipyretic properties that exerts its pharmacological effects by inhibiting the synthesis of factors involved in pain, fever, and inflammation. The exact mechanism of action of indometacin in inducing closure of a patent ductus arteriosus is not fully understood; however, it is thought to be through inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis."
258,DB00330,"Ethambutol was first described in the literature in 1961. It has a long duration of action as it is administered daily, and a moderate therapeutic window. Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of optic neuritis and hepatic toxicity.Ethambutol diffuses into _Mycobacterium_ cells. Once inside the cell, ethambutol inhibits the arabinosyltransferases (embA, embB, and embC), preventing formation of the cell wall components arabinogalactan and lipoarabinomannan, and preventing cell division. Lipoarabinomannan is a component of a cell surface molecule involved in the interaction with host cells."
259,DB00331,"Fasting plasma glucose is also a useful and important measure of glycemic control. Metformin decreases blood glucose levels by decreasing hepatic glucose production (also called gluconeogenesis), decreasing the intestinal absorption of glucose, and increasing insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. It is well established that metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I activity, and it has since been generally postulated that its potent antidiabetic effects occur through this mechanism. The above processes lead to a decrease in blood glucose, managing type II diabetes and exerting positive effects on glycemic control. In addition to the above pathway, the mechanism of action of metformin may be explained by other ways, and its exact mechanism of action has been under extensive study in recent years."
260,DB00332,"Asthma exacerbations are characterized by a progressive increase in one or more of asthma symptoms accompanied by a decrease in expiratory flow. As a single agent, ipratropium was indicated for the symptomatic relief of rhinorrhea associated with the common cold or seasonal allergic rhinitis for patients 5 years or older. The chronic obstructive pulmonary disease includes a large number of conditions characterized by breathlessness. Sialorrhea is a common symptom that accompanies different neurologic conditions and it is characterized by drooling or excessive salivation.Ipratropium is a quaternary ammonium derivative of  that acts as an anticholinergic agent. Ipratropium as a therapeutic agent was developed by Boehringer Ingelheim and its first monotherapy product was FDA approved in 1986, while the combination product of ipratropium and  was approved in 1996.Ipratropium is a short-acting agent that inhibits the parasympathetic nervous system at the level of the airway which then produces bronchodilatation."
261,DB00333,"Methadone is also indicated for detoxification treatment of opioid addiction (heroin or other morphine-like drugs), and for maintenance substitution treatment for opioid dependence in adults in conjunction with appropriate social and medical services.Methadone is a potent synthetic analgesic that works as a full Âµ-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. Methadone shares similar effects and risks of other opioids such as , , , and . These effects make methadone a good option for the treatment of severe pain and addiction as fewer doses are needed to maintain analgesia and prevent opioid withdrawal symptoms. Deaths have been reported during conversion from chronic, high-dose treatment with other opioid agonists. While agonism of the Âµ-opioid receptor is the primary mechanism of action for the treatment of pain, methadone also acts as an agonist of Îº- and Ï-opioid receptors within the central and peripheral nervous systems."
262,DB00334,"Olanzapine is also approved for the management of psychomotor agitation associated with schizophrenia and bipolar I mania. This characteristic significantly reduces the presence of side effects. Clinical trials for the original use of olanzapine demonstrated significant effectiveness in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in adults and acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar disorder in adolescents. In a high-level study of the effect of olanzapine for this condition, a complete response on the delay phase was observed in 84% of the individual and control of emesis of over 80% despite the phase.The activity of olanzapine is achieved by the antagonism of multiple neuronal receptors including the dopamine receptor D1, D2, D3 and D4 in the brain, the serotonin receptors 5HT2A, 5HT2C, 5HT3 and 5HT6, the alpha-1 adrenergic receptor, the histamine receptor H1 and multiple muscarinic receptors. The binding of olanzapine to the dopamine D2 receptors is easily dissociable and hence, it allows for a certain degree of dopamine neurotransmission."
263,DB00335,"2) Management of heart failure. The use of atenolol may need to be based on more patient factors than hypertension alone.Atenolol is a cardio-selective beta-blocker and as such exerts most of its effects on the heart. It acts as an antagonist to sympathetic innervation and prevents increases in heart rate, electrical conductivity, and contractility in the heart due to increased release of norepinephrine from the peripheral nervous system. The effects of atenolol on blood pressure have been established, although it is less effective than alternative beta-blockers, but the mechanism has not yet been characterized. Unlike some other beta-blocker drugs, atenolol does not have intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilizing activity nor does it produce changes in glycemic control.Atenolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker, called such because it selectively binds to the Î²1-adrenergic receptor as an antagonist up to a reported 26 fold more than Î²2 receptors."

It is currently available as a topic cream used in the treatment of atopic dermatitis (eczema).Pimecrolimus is a chemical that is used to treat atopic dermatitis (eczema). Scientists do not know exactly how pimecrolimus reduces the manifestations of atopic dermatitis, but pimecrolimus reduces the action of T-cells and mast cells which are part of the immune system and contribute to responses of the immune system. As a consequence, it inhibits T cell activation by blocking the transcription of early cytokines. Also, pimecrolimus prevents the release of inflammatory cytokines and mediators from mast cells in vitro after stimulation by antigen/lgE."
265,DB00338,"Omeprazole, according to the FDA label  is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) used for the following purposes:    ï¿½?Treatment of active duodenal ulcer in adults     ï¿½?Eradication of Helicobacter pylori to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer  recurrence in adults     ï¿½?Treatment of active benign gastric ulcer in adults     ï¿½?Reduction of risk of upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding in critically ill adult patients. **Effects on gastric acid secretion**    This drug decreases gastric acid secretion . **Effects on serum gastrin**    In studies of 200 or more patients, serum gastrin levels increased during the first 1-2 weeks of daily administration of therapeutic doses of omeprazole. Omeprazole is a member of a class of antisecretory compounds, the substituted _benzimidazoles_, that stop gastric acid secretion by selective inhibition of the _H+/K+ ATPase_ enzyme system. The treatment of H. pylori infection may include the addition of omeprazole or other proton pump inhibitors as part of the treatment regimen , ."
266,DB00339,"In vitro and in vivo, the drug is active only at a slightly acid pH. This interferes with the bacteriums ability to synthesize new fatty acids, required for growth and replication.Pyrazinamide diffuses into active _M. Pyrazinoic acid was thought to inhibit the enzyme fatty acid synthase (FAS) I, which is required by the bacterium to synthesise fatty acids. However, further studies reproduced the results of FAS I inhibition as the putative mechanism first in whole cell assay of replicating M. tuberculosis bacilli which have shown that pyrazinoic acid and its ester inhibit the synthesis of fatty acids. This study was followed by in vitro assay of tuberculous FAS I enzyme that tested the activity with pyrazinamide, pyrazinoic acid and several classes of pyrazinamide analogs."
267,DB00340,"Used for the symptomatic treatment of parkinsonism.Metixene (or methixene) is a anticholinergic used as an antiparkinsonian agent.Metixene is a tertiary antimuscarinic with actions similar to those of atropine; it also has antihistaminic and direct antispasmodic properties. It is used for the symptomatic treatment of parkinsonism, including the alleviation of the extrapyramidal syndrome induced by other drugs such as phenothiazines, but, like other antimuscarinics, it is of no value against tardive dyskinesias. Metixene has been discontinued.Parkinsonism is thought to result from an imbalance between the excitatory (cholinergic) and inhibitory (dopaminergic) systems in the corpus striatum. The mechanism of action of centrally active anticholinergic drugs such as metixene is considered to relate to competitive antagonism of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors in the corpus striatum, which then restores the balance."
268,DB00341,"**Perennial allergic rhinitis**: This drug is indicated for the relief of symptoms associated with perennial allergic rhinitis due to allergens including dust mites, animal dander, and molds in adults and children 6 months of age and older. It markedly reduces the occurrence, severity, and duration of hives and significantly reduces pruritus .Cetirizine, also commonly known as _Zyrtec_, is an orally active second-generation histamine H1 antagonist proven effective in the treatment of various allergic symptoms, such as sneezing, coughing, nasal congestion, hives, and other symptoms , . Furthermore, some antihistamine agents that are used to treat this condition cause undesirable, sedating effects . **General effects and respiratory effects**    Cetirizine, the active metabolite of the piperazine H1-receptor antagonist hydroxyzine, minimizes or eliminates the symptoms of chronic idiopathic urticaria, perennial allergic rhinitis, seasonal allergic rhinitis, allergic asthma, physical urticaria, and atopic dermatitis. In vitro receptor binding studies have demonstrated no detectable affinity of cetirizine for histamine receptors  other than the H1 receptors."
269,DB00342,"For the treatment of allergic rhinitis, hay fever, and allergic skin disorders.In the U.S., Terfenadine was superseded by fexofenadine in the 1990s due to the risk of cardiac arrhythmia caused by QT interval prolongation.Terfenadine, an H1-receptor antagonist antihistamine, is similar in structure to astemizole and haloperidol, a butyrophenone antipsychotic. The active metabolite of terfenadine is fexofenadine.Terfenadine competes with histamine for binding at H1-receptor sites in the GI tract, uterus, large blood vessels, and bronchial muscle. This reversible binding of terfenadine to H1-receptors suppresses the formation of edema, flare, and pruritus resulting from histaminic activity. As the drug does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier, CNS depression is minimal."
270,DB00343,"Being a potent vasodilator, diltiazem is used clinically as an antihypertensive, anti-arrhythmic, and as an anti-anginal agent  for the management of cardiovascular conditions such as hypertension, chronic stable angina, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter. As the magnitude of blood pressure reduction is related to the degree of hypertension, the antihypertensive effect of diltiazem is most pronounced in individuals with hypertension. It is proposed that this cation influx may also trigger the release of additional calcium ions from intracellular storage sites. Through its actions on reducing calcium levels in cardiac and vascular smooth muscles, diltiazem causes a reduction in the contractile processes of the myocardial smooth muscle cells and vasodilation of the coronary and systemic arteries, including epicardial and subendocardial. Diltiazem lowers myocardial oxygen demand through a reduction in heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac contractility; this leads to a therapeutic effect in improving exercise tolerance in chronic stable angina."
271,DB00344,"In depressed individuals, protriptyline exerts a positive effect on mood. TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. The antidepressant effects of TCAs are thought to be due to an overall increase in serotonergic neurotransmission. TCAs also block histamine H1 receptors, alpha1-adrenergic receptors and muscarinic receptors, which accounts for their sedative, hypotensive and anticholinergic effects (e.g. blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention), respectively.Protriptyline may be used for the treatment of depression.Protriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant. The effectiveness of antidepressants appear after approximately two weeks following recommended adminsitration schedule."
272,DB00345,"Used to measure effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) and to determine the functional capacity of the tubular excretory mechanism.The glycine amide of 4-aminobenzoic acid. Its sodium salt is used as a diagnostic aid to measure effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) and excretory capacity. It is filtered by the glomeruli and is actively secreted by the proximal tubules. At low plasma concentrations (1.0 to 2.0 mg/100 mL), an average of 90 percent of aminohippurate is cleared by the kidneys from the renal blood stream in a single circulation. It is ideally suited for measurement of ERPF since it has a high clearance, is essentially nontoxic at the plasma concentrations reached with recommended doses, and its analytical determination is relatively simple and accurate."
273,DB00346,"Alfuzosin is used to treat the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The prevalence of BPH is as high as 50%-60% for males in their 60's, and this prevalence increases to 80%-90% of those over 70. It was initially approved by the FDA in 2003 and is marketed by several pharmaceutical companies.By selectively inhibiting alpha adrenergic receptors in the lower urinary tract, alfuzosin causes smooth muscle relaxation in the bladder neck and prostate, improving urine flow, thereby reducing BPH symptoms. Additionally, alfuzosin reduces the vasoconstrictor effect of catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine), leading to peripheral vasodilation. This leads to the relaxation of smooth muscle in both the prostate and bladder neck, resulting in the improvement in urine flow and a reduction of urinary symptoms."
274,DB00347,"Used in the control of absence (petit mal) seizures that are refractory to treatment with other medications.An anticonvulsant effective in absence seizures, but generally reserved for refractory cases because of its toxicity. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1994, p378)Paramethadione and trimethadione are anticonvulsants indicated in the control of absence (petit mal) seizures that are refractory to treatment with other medications. Dione anticonvulsants are used in the treatment of epilepsy. They act on the central nervous system (CNS) to reduce the number of seizures.Dione anticonvulsants reduce T-type calcium currents in thalamic neurons, including thalamic relay neurons. It does so via the inhibition of voltage dependent T-type calcium channels."
275,DB00349,"Clobazam is indicated for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients 2 years of age or older. Clobazam belongs to the 1,5-benzodiazepine class of drugs and is marketed under different names, Onfi, Frisium, Urbanyl, and others.. Clobazam was first synthesized in 1966 and first published in 1969, following the incidental synthesis and discovery of the first benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide in the 1950s. Unlike older 1,4-benzodiazepines, clobazam has a better side-effects profile, particularly less sedative and amnesic effects. Specifically, clobazam binds to the interface of the Î±<sub>2</sub> and Î³<sub>2</sub>-subunit of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor. It has a great affinity for the Î±<sub>2</sub> subunit than the Î±<sub>1</sub> subunit compared to other 1,4âbenzodiazepines.Binding of clobazam to the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor causes chloride channels to open, resulting in an influx of chloride and thus hyperpolarization of neurons."
276,DB00350,"For the treatment of severe hypertension and in the topical treatment (regrowth) of androgenic alopecia in males and females and stabilisation of hair loss in patients with androgenic alopecia.A potent direct-acting peripheral vasodilator (vasodilator agents) that reduces peripheral resistance and produces a fall in blood pressure.Minoxidil is an orally effective direct acting peripheral vasodilator that reduces elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure by decreasing peripheral vascular resistance. Minoxidil is also used topically to treat androgenetic alopecia. In man, forearm and renal vascular resistance decline; forearm blood flow increases while renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate are preserved. The predominant site of minoxidil action is arterial. The antihypertensive activity of minoxidil is due to its sulphate metabolite, minoxidil sulfate.Minoxidil is thought to promote the survival of human dermal papillary cells (DPCs) or hair cells by activating both extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt and by preventing cell death by increasing the ratio of BCl-2/Bax."
277,DB00351,"As the acetate, it is more potent than progesterone both as a progestagen and as an ovulation inhibitor. It has also been used in the palliative treatment of breast cancer.Megestrol is a synthetic progestin and has the same physiologic effects as natural progesterone. Mestrogel has slight glucocorticoid activity and very slight mineralocorticoid activity. Initially developed as a contraceptive, it was first evaluated in breast cancer treatment in 1967.The precise mechanism by which megestrol acetate produces effects in anorexia and cachexia is unknown at the present time, but its progestin antitumour activity may involve suppression of luteinizing hormone by inhibition of pituitary function. It has also been suggested that megestrol may alter metabolic pathyways via interferences with the production or action of mediators such as cachectin, a hormone that inhibits adipocyte lipogenic enzymes."
278,DB00352,"For remission induction and remission consolidation treatment of acute nonlymphocytic leukemias.An antineoplastic compound which also has antimetabolite action. TGMP interferes with the synthesis of guanine nucleotides by its inhibition of purine biosynthesis by pseudofeedback inhibition of glutamine-5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase, the first enzyme unique to the de novo pathway of purine ribonucleotide synthesis. Thioguanine nucleotides are incorporated into both the DNA and the RNA by phosphodiester linkages, and some studies have shown that incorporation of such false bases contributes to the cytotoxicity of thioguanine. Its tumor inhibitory properties may be due to one or more of its effects on feedback inhibition of de novo purine synthesis; inhibition of purine nucleotide interconversions; or incorporation into the DNA and RNA. The overall result of its action is a sequential blockade of the utilization and synthesis of the purine nucleotides."
279,DB00353,"For the prevention and control of excessive bleeding following vaginal childbirthA homolog of ergonovine containing one more CH2 group. (Merck Index, 11th ed)Methylergometrine is a semisynthetic ergot alkaloid and a derivative of ergonovine and is used for the prevention and control of postpartum and post-abortion hemorrhage. In general, the effects of all the ergot alkaloids appear to results from their actions as partial agonists or antagonists at adrenergic, dopaminergic, and tryptaminergic receptors. The spectrum of effects depends on the agent, dosage, species, tissue, and experimental or physiological conditions. All of the alkaloids of ergot significantly increase the motor activity of the uterus."
280,DB00354,"For prevention and treatment of nausea, vomiting, and dizziness associated with motion sickness and vertigo (dizziness caused by other medical problems).Buclizine is an antihistamine medication with both antiemetic and anticholinergic effects , belonging to the _piperazine derivative_ family of drugs. Buclizine is used in the prevention and treatment of nausea, vomiting, and dizziness associated with motion sickness. The vomiting centre possesses neurons which are rich in muscarinic cholinergic and histamine containing synapses. These types of neurons are especially involved in transmission from the vestibular apparatus to the vomiting centre. Hence the action of buclizine which acts to block the histamine receptors in the vomiting centre and thus reduce activity along these pathways."
281,DB00355,"Aztreonam exhibits potent and specific activity in vitro against a wide spectrum of gram-negative aerobic pathogens including <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. It has no useful activity against gram-positive bacteria or anaerobes, but has very broad spectrum against gram-negative aerobes, including <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. Aztreonam, unlike the majority of beta-lactam antibiotics, does not induce beta-lactamase activity and its molecular structure confers a high degree of resistance to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases (such as penicillinases and cephalosporinases) produced by most gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens; it is, therefore, usually active against gram-negative aerobic microorganisms that are resistant to antibiotics hydrolyzed by beta-lactamases. Aztreonam maintains its antimicrobial activity over a pH range of 6 to 8 in vitro, as well as in the presence of human serum and under anaerobic conditions.The bactericidal action of aztreonam results from the inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis due to a high affinity of aztreonam for penicillin binding protein 3 (PBP3). It is possible that aztreonam interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."
282,DB00356,"For the relief of discomfort associated with acute painful musculoskeletal conditions.A centrally acting central muscle relaxant with sedative properties. It is claimed to inhibit muscle spasm by exerting an effect primarily at the level of the spinal cord and subcortical areas of the brain. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoea, 30th ed, p1202)Chlorzoxazone is a centrally-acting agent for painful musculoskeletal conditions. The clinical result is a reduction of the skeletal muscle spasm with relief of pain and increased mobility of the involved muscles.Chlorzoxazone inhibits degranulation of mast cells, subsequently preventing the release of histamine and slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A), mediators of type I allergic reactions. Chlorzoxazone also may reduce the release of inflammatory leukotrienes."
283,DB00357,"It also blocks the conversion of androgens to estrogens. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p454)Aminoglutethimide inhibits the enzymatic conversion of cholesterol to D5-pregnenolone, resulting in a decrease in the production of adrenal glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, estrogens, and androgens.Aminoglutethimide reduces the production of D5-pregnenolone and blocks several other steps in steroid synthesis, including the C-11, C-18, and C-21 hydroxylations and the hydroxylations required for the aromatization of androgens to estrogens, mediated through the binding of aminoglutethimide to cytochrome P-450 complexes. A decrease in adrenal secretion of cortisol is followed by an increased secretion of pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which will overcome the blockade of adrenocortical steroid synthesis by aminoglutethimide. Since aminoglutethimide increases the rate of metabolism of dexamethasone but not that of hydrocortisone, the latter is preferred as the adrenal glucocorticoid replacement. In spite of an increase in TSH, aminoglutethimide has not been associated with increased prolactin secretion."
284,DB00358,"Mefloquine is also indicated for the prophylaxis of malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, including chloroquine-resistant forms of Plasmodium falciparum. Malaria is a protozoan disease that places an enormous burden on human health in endemic areas around the world. The 2020 World Health Organization malaria report indicates a 60% decrease in the global malaria fatality rate between 2000 to 2019. Despite this, malaria remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality; 90% of deaths from malaria occur in Africa. Mefloquine, commonly known as Lariam, is an antimalarial drug used for the prevention and treatment of malaria caused by infection with Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum."
285,DB00359,"The sulfonamides are synthetic bacteriostatic antibiotics with a wide spectrum against most gram-positive and many gram-negative organisms. However, many strains of an individual species may be resistant. Bacterial sensitivity is the same for the various sulfonamides, and resistance to one sulfonamide indicates resistance to all. Most sulfonamides are readily absorbed orally. Their antibacterial action is inhibited by pus.Sulfadiazine is a competitive inhibitor of the bacterial enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase."
286,DB00360,"For the treatment of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency.Sapropterin (tetrahydrobiopterin or BH4) is a cofactor in the synthesis of nitric oxide. It is also essential in the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine by the enzyme phenylalanine-4-hydroxylase; the conversion of tyrosine to L-dopa by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase; and conversion of tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophan via tryptophan hydroxylase.Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is used to convert several amino acids, including phenylalanine, to other essential molecules in the body including neurotransmitters. Tetrahydrobiopterin is also a natural co-factor for nitrate oxide synthase. As a co-factor for PAH, tetrahydrobiopterin allows the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine and reduces the level of phenylalanine in the bloodstream, thereby reducing the toxic effects of of this amino acid. Normal serum concentrations of phenylalanine are 100 micomolar, while elevated (toxic) levels are typically >1200 micromolar."
287,DB00361,"Vinorelbine tartrate is indicated for adults in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as a single therapy or in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs . Vinorelbine is an anti-mitotic chemotherapy drug that is used in the treatment of several types of malignancies, including breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) . This structural modification contributes to unique pharmacologic properties.The antitumor activity of vinorelbine tartrate is believed to be owed to the inhibition of mitosis at metaphase via its interaction with tubulin . Vinorelbine is a mitotic spindle poison that interferes with chromosomal segregation during mitosis, also known as cell division. Microtubules, which are derived from polymers of tubulin, are the main target of vinorelbine."
288,DB00362,"For use in the treatment of the following fungal infections: Candidemia and other forms of Candida infections (intra-abdominal abscess, and peritonitis), Aspergillus infections, and esophageal candidiasis. Also considered an alternative treatment for oropharyngeal canaidiasis.Anidulafungin or Eraxis is an anti-fungal drug manufactured by Pfizer that gained approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 21, 2006; it was previously known as LY303366. Anidulafungin is an echinocandin, a class of antifungal drugs that inhibits the synthesis of 1,3-&beta;-D-glucan, an essential component of fungal cell walls. Like other echinocandins, anidulafungin is not active against Cryptococcus neoformans, Trichosporon, Fusarium, or zygomycetes.Anidulafungin is a semi-synthetic echinocandin with antifungal activity. This results in inhibition of the formation of 1,3-&beta;-D-glucan, an essential component of the fungal cell wall, ultimately leading to osmotic instability and cell death."
289,DB00363,"Due to its severe adverse effects profile, clozapine is only available through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Clozapine REMS Program.Clozapine is a psychotropic agent belonging to the chemical class of benzisoxazole derivatives that is universally regarded as the treatment of choice for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Although it is thought to mediate its pharmacological effect through antagonism of the dopamine type 2 (D<sub>2) and the serotonin type 2A (5-HT2A>) receptors, research have shown that clozapine can act on various types of receptors. Testing is initially completed at one-week intervals but is expanded to two-week intervals at six months, and then four-week intervals at twelve months if lab results have been within an appropriate range. If myocarditis occurs, the patient should not be re-challenged with clozapine. Antagonism at receptors other than dopamine and 5HT2 with similar receptor affinities may explain some of the other therapeutic and side effects of clozapine."
290,DB00364,"The sucralfate suspension  and tablet  are used for the treatment of active duodenal ulcer for up to 8 weeks. The tablet form may be used at a lower dose for healed duodenal ulcers, for the purpose of maintaining healing and preventing recurrence . It is considered a _cytoprotective agent_, protecting cells in the gastrointestinal tract from damage caused by agents such as gastric acid, bile salts, alcohol, and acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), among other substances . It was approved by the FDA  1982 in tablet form, and in 1994 for the suspension form .This drug aids in the healing of duodenal ulcers, relieving painful inflammation by creating a protective mechanical barrier between the lining or skin of the gastrointestinal tract and damaging substances . Sucralfate has also been shown to adsorb bile salts in the laboratory, setting, which could further contribute to its beneficial effects in ulcer healing ."
291,DB00365,"For treatment of adults with mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Moraxella catarrhalis.Grepafloxacin is an oral broad-spectrum quinoline antibacterial agent used to treat bacterial infections. Due to the QTc-prolonging potential, as indicated by the changes in the QT interval on the electrocardiogram, and the risk for cardiovascular adverse events, grepafloxacin was withdrawn in the United States.Grepafloxacin has in vitro activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic microorganisms, as well as some atypical microorganisms.Grepafloxacin exerts its antibacterial activity by inhibiting bacterial topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV, essential enzymes for duplication, transcription, and repair of bacterial DNA."
292,DB00366,"Histamine H1 antagonist with pronounced sedative properties. Doxylamine has also been administered in veterinary applications and was formerly used in parkinsonism.Doxylamine is an antihistamine commonly used as a sleep aid. Doxylamine is a member of the ethanolamine class of antihistamines and has anti-allergy power far superior to virtually every other antihistamine on the market, with the exception of diphenhydramine (Benadryl). Doxylamine is also a potent anticholinergic.Like other antihistamines, doxylamine acts by competitively inhibiting histamine at H1&nbsp;receptors. It also has substantial sedative and anticholinergic effects."
293,DB00367,"This levonorgestrel-only form of contraception is not indicated for regular contraception and must be taken as soon as possible within 72 hours after intercourse. Also known as Plan B, it is used as a single agent in emergency contraception, and as a hormonal contraceptive released from an intrauterine device, commonly referred to as an IUD. The levonorgestrel-only containing emergency contraceptive tablet is 89% effective if it is used according to prescribing information within 72 hours after intercourse. Levonorgestrel has been proven to be more effective when administered before ovulation. Interestingly, recent evidence has refuted the commonly believed notion that levonorgestrel changes the consistency of cervical mucus when it is taken over a short-term period, as in emergency contraception."
294,DB00368,Mainly used to treat patients in vasodilatory shock states such as septic shock and neurogenic shock and has shown a survival benefit over dopamine. Also used as a vasopressor medication for patients with critical hypotension.Precursor of epinephrine that is secreted by the adrenal medulla and is a widespread central and autonomic neurotransmitter. Norepinephrine is the principal transmitter of most postganglionic sympathetic fibers and of the diffuse projection system in the brain arising from the locus ceruleus. It is also found in plants and is used pharmacologically as a sympathomimetic.Noradrenaline acts on both alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors to cause vasoconstriction. Its effect in-vitro is often limited to the increasing of blood pressure through antagonising alpha-1 and alpha-2 receptors and causing a resultant increase in systemic vascular resistance.Norepinephrine functions as a peripheral vasoconstrictor by acting on alpha-adrenergic receptors.
295,DB00369,"For the treatment of CMV retinitis in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)Cidofovir is an injectable antiviral medication employed in the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in patients diagnosed with AIDS. It suppresses CMV replication through selective inhibition of viral DNA synthesis. It is classified as a nucleotide analogue and is active against herpes cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis infection. Cidofovir diphosphate inhibits herpesvirus polymerases at concentrations that are 8- to 600-fold lower than those needed to inhibit human cellular DNA polymerase alpha, beta, and gamma(1,2,3). Incorporation of cidofovir into the growing viral DNA chain results in reductions in the rate of viral DNA synthesis."
296,DB00370,"In addition to its beneficial effects in depression, mirtazapine has been reported to be efficacious in the off-label management of various other conditions. In a clinical trial, women with depression experienced a clinically significant mean increase in body weight, fat mass, and concentrations of leptin when treated with mirtazapine for a 6-week period, with a lack of effect on glucose homeostasis. **Summary**    The mechanism of action of mirtazapine is not fully understood but may be explained by its effects on central adrenergic and serotonergic activity. **Effects on various receptors**    It has been shown that both noradrenergic and serotonergic activity increase following mirtazapine administration. The pain-relieving effects of mirtazapine may be explained by its effects on opioid receptors."
297,DB00371,"It is used in the treatment of anxiety disorders, and also for the short-term management of insomnia but has largely been superseded by the benzodiazepines. Meprobamate has most of the pharmacological effects and dangers of the barbiturates (though it was marketed as being safer) but it is less sedating at effective doses. Meprobamate exhibits some anticonvulsant effects in absence seizures; however, it is reported to potentially exacerbate generalized tonic-clonic seizures. However, its is currently only licensed as an anxiolytic and it is a third or fourth-order choice.Meprobamate's mechanism of action is not fully understood; in animal studies, meprobamate is reported to act at multiple sites in the central nervous system, such as the thalamus and limbic system. It binds to the GABAA receptors, leading to inhibitory effects on the neurons transmitting signals in the reticular formation and spinal cord."
298,DB00372,"For the treatment or relief of nausea and vomiting.A dopamine antagonist that is particularly useful in treating the nausea and vomiting associated with anesthesia, mildly emetic cancer chemotherapy agents, radiation therapy, and toxins. This piperazine phenothiazine does not prevent vertigo or motion sickness. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1994, p457)Thiethylperazine, an atypical antipsychotic agent, is used to treat both negative and positive symptoms of schizophrenia, acute mania with bipolar disorder, agitation, and psychotic symptoms in dementia. Future uses may include the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder and severe behavioral disorders in autism. Structurally and pharmacologically similar to clozapine, Thiethylperazine binds to alpha(1), dopamine, histamine H1, muscarinic, and serotonin type 2 (5-HT2) receptors.Thiethylperazine is an antagonist at types 1, 2, and 4 dopamine receptors, 5-HT receptor types 2A and 2C, muscarinic receptors 1 through 5, alpha(1)-receptors, and histamine H1-receptors."
299,DB00373,"It is also used in tablet form as a drug to treat hypertension. This drug is marketed by several manufacturers  and is an effective agent for the management of conditions such as open-angle glaucoma and hypertension.Timolol, when administered by the ophthalmic route, rapidly reduces intraocular pressure. When administered in the tablet form, it reduces blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output, and decreases sympathetic activity.. This leads to diminished actions of catecholamines, which normally bind to adrenergic receptors and exert sympathetic effects leading to an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. Beta(1)-receptor blockade by timolol leads to a decrease in both heart rate and cardiac output during rest and exercise, and a decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure."
300,DB00374,"It reduces symptoms in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease. Treprostinil was approved by the FDA in 2002 for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. The effect of oral treprostinil on QTc has not been evaluated. Due to its ability to inhibit platelet aggregation, treprostinil can increase the risk of bleeding, and patients with low systemic arterial pressure taking treprostinil may experience symptomatic hypotension. When given intravenously, treprostinil can lead to infusion complications and increase the risk of bloodstream infections.Treprostinil is a stable analogue of prostacyclin, a prostaglandin that acts as an anti-thrombotic agent and a potent vasodilator."
301,DB00375,"Colestipol is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet for the reduction of elevated serum total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (a condition that features elevated LDL-C) who do not respond adequately to dietary changes . Therapy with lipid-altering agents like colestipol should be a component of multiple risk factor intervention in those individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia . And even though such an agent may very well be useful in reducing elevated cholesterol levels and decreasing the risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia, colestipol is still generally only employed as an adjunct therapy and the relatively physical nature of its pharmacological activity sometimes limits its usefulness. A major portion of the bile acids secreted is reabsorbed from the intestines and returned via the portal circulation to the liver, thus completing the enterohepatic cycle . This results in an increase in the number of hepatic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, and consequently an increased uptake of LDL and a decrease in serum/plasma beta lipoprotein or total and LDL cholesterol levels ."
302,DB00376,"Tihexyphenidyl is indicated as an adjunct in the treatment of parkinsonism, an adjuvant in the treatment of parkinsonism with levodopa, and in the control of extrapyramidal disorders caused by central nervous system drugs.Trihexyphenidyl is a centrally acting muscarinic antagonist used for treatment of parkinsonism and drug-induced extrapyramidal disorders. Its discovery was published in 1949 in a study looking for drugs with antispasmodic activity. Trihexyphenidyl was granted FDA approval on 13 May 1949.Trihexyphenidyl is an antimuscarinic indicated as an adjunct in the treatment of parkinsonism or as a treatment for drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms. It has a long duration of action as it does not need to be given every day. Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of anhidrosis and hyperthermia.Trihexyphenidyl is a non-selective muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist but binds with higher affinity to the M1 subtype."
303,DB00377,"For the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, as well as prevention of acute nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy. It is the most effective of the 5-HT3 antagonists in controlling delayed CINV nausea and vomiting that appear more than 24 hours after the first dose of a course of chemotherapy and is the only drug of its class approved for this use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The serotonin then stimulates the vagal and splanchnic nerve receptors that project to the medullary vomiting center, as well as the 5-HT3 receptors in the area postrema, thus initiating the vomiting reflex, causing nausea and vomiting.Palonosetron is a selective serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. The antiemetic activity of the drug is brought about through the inhibition of 5-HT3 receptors present both centrally (medullary chemoreceptor zone) and peripherally (GI tract). It has been hypothesized that palonosetron's potency and long plasma half-life may contribute to its observed efficacy in preventing delayed nausea and vomiting caused by moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy."
304,DB00378,"Also used to prevent natural abortion in patients who have a history of habitual abortions.A synthetic progestational hormone with no androgenic or estrogenic properties. Unlike many other progestational compounds, dydrogesterone produces no increase in temperature and does not inhibit ovulation.Dydrogesterone is an orally active progestogen which acts directly on the uterus, producing a complete secretory endometrium in an estrogen-primed uterus. At therapeutic levels, dydrogesterone has no contraceptive effect as it does not inhibit or interfere with ovulation or the corpus luteum. Furthermore, dydrogesterone is non-androgenic, non-estrogenic, non-corticoid, non-anabolic and is not excreted as pregnanediol. Therefore, it may be useful in the treatment of menstrual disorders such as absent, irregular or painful menstrual periods, infertility, premenstrual syndrome and endometriosis.Dydrogesterone is a progestogen that works by regulating the healthy growth and normal shedding of the womb lining by acting on progesterone receptors in the uterus."
305,DB00379,"For the treatment of ventricular tachycardia and symptomatic premature ventricular beats, and prevention of ventricular fibrillation.Antiarrhythmic agent pharmacologically similar to lidocaine. Mexiletine has fast onset and offset kinetics, meaning that they have little or no effect at slower heart rates, and more effects at faster heart rates. It shortens the action potential duration, reduces refractoriness, and decreases Vmax in partially depolarized cells with fast response action potentials. Mexiletine either does not change the action potential duration, or decreases the action potential duration.Mexiletine, like lidocaine, inhibits the inward sodium current required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thus reducing the rate of rise of the action potential, Phase 0. The decrease in ERP is of lesser magnitude than the decrease in action potential duration (APD), which results in an increase in the ERP/APD ratio."
306,DB00380,"The Food and Drug Administration has designated dexrazoxane as an orphan drug for use in the prevention or reduction in the incidence and severity of anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy.Dexrazoxane is a cardioprotective agent for use in conjunction with doxorubicin indicated for reducing the incidence and severity of cardiomyopathy associated with doxorubicin administration in women with metastatic breast cancer who have received a cumulative doxorubicin dose. Although the exact mechanism of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is not known, it has shown to exert a variety of actions that may result in the development of cardiotoxicity. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the main cause of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is associated with free-radical damage to DNA. Chelation of metal ions, particularly iron, by anthracyclines results in an anthracycline-metal complex that catalyzes the generation of reactive oxygen free radicals. Results of laboratory studies suggest that dexrazoxane (a prodrug) is converted intracellularly to a ring-opened bidentate chelating agent that chelates to free iron and interferes with iron-mediated free radical generation thought to be responsible, in part, for anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy."
307,DB00381,"The option for single daily dosing of amlodipine is an attractive feature of this drug . Acute intravenous administration of amlodipine reduces arterial blood pressure and increases heart rate in patients with chronic stable angina, however, chronic oral administration of amlodipine in clinical studies did not cause clinically significant alterations in heart rate or blood pressures in patients diagnosed with angina and normal blood pressure. In clinical trials in which amlodipine was given in combination with beta-blockers to patients diagnosed with hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic parameters were noted. **Mechanism of action on blood pressure**    Amlodipine is considered a peripheral arterial vasodilator that exerts its action directly on vascular smooth muscle to lead to a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance, causing a decrease in blood pressure. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (calcium ion antagonist or slow-channel blocker) that inhibits the influx of calcium ions into both vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle."
308,DB00382,"For the palliative treatment of mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer's type.A centerally active cholinesterase inhibitor that has been used to counter the effects of muscle relaxants, as a respiratory stimulant, and in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other central nervous system disorders. An early pathophysiological feature of Alzheimer's disease that is associated with memory loss and cognitive deficits is a deficiency of acetylcholine as a result of selective loss of cholinergic neurons in the cerebral cortex, nucleus basalis, and hippocampus. This is accomplished by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses through reversible inhibition of its hydrolysis by acetylcholinesterase. If this proposed mechanism of action is correct, tacrine's effect may lessen as the disease progresses and fewer cholinergic neurons remain functionally intact. There is no evidence that tacrine alters the course of the underlying dementing process.The mechanism of tacrine is not fully known, but it is suggested that the drug is an anticholinesterase agent which reversibly binds with and inactivates cholinesterases."
309,DB00383,"For the treatment of peptic ulcer disease and the relief of smooth muscle spasms in gastrointestinal disorders.Oxyphencyclimine is an anticholinergic drug (trade name Daricon) used in treating peptic ulcers.Oxyphencyclimine is a synthetic anticholinergic agent which has been shown in experimental and clinical studies to have a pronounced antispasmodic and antisecretory effect on the gastrointestinal tract. Oxyphencyclimine is an antimuscarinic, anticholinergic drug.Oxyphencyclimine binds the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. It may block all three types of muscarinic receptors including M-1 receptors in the CNS and ganglia, M-2 receptors in the heart (vagus) and M-3 receptors at the parasympathetic NEJ system. The muscarinic acetylcholine receptors mediate various cellular responses, including inhibition of adenylate cyclase, breakdown of phosphoinositides and modulation of potassium channels through the action of G proteins. Oxphencyclimine inhibits vagally mediated reflexes by antagonizing the action of acetylcholine."
310,DB00384,"It works by promoting the excretion of sodium ions and water while decreasing the potassium excretion in the distal part of the nephron in the kidneys by working on the lumenal side. Currently, triamterene is used in the treatment of edema associated with various conditions as monotherapy and is approved for use with other diuretics to enhance diuretic and potassium-sparing effects. It is also found in a combination product with hydrochlorothiazide that is used for the management of hypertension or treatment of edema in patients who develop hypokalemia on hydrochlorothiazide alone.Triamterene, a relatively weak, potassium-sparing diuretic and antihypertensive, is used in the management of hypertension and edema. Triamterene exerts a diuretic effect on the distal renal tubule to inhibit the reabsorption of sodium ions in exchange for potassium and hydrogen ions and its natriuretic activity is limited by the amount of sodium reaching its site of action. Triamterene maintains or increases sodium excretion, thereby increasing the excretion of water, and reducing the excess loss of potassium, hydrogen, and chloride ions by inhibiting the distal tubular exchange mechanism."

It is a semisynthetic analog of the , which is an anthracycline drug. Used in the treatment of the bladder cancer, valrubicin is administered by direct infusion into the bladder.Valrubicin is an anticancer agent. Valrubicin is an anthracycline that affects a variety of inter-related biological functions, most of which involve nucleic acid metabolism. It readily penetrates into cells, where after DNA intercalation, it inhibits the incorporation of nucleosides into nucleic acids, causes extensive chromosomal damage, and arrests cell cycle in G2."
312,DB00387,"For the treatment of all forms of Parkinson's Disease, as well as control of extrapyramidal reactions induced by antipsychotic agents.A muscarinic antagonist that crosses the blood-brain barrier and is used in the treatment of drug-induced extrapyramidal disorders and in parkinsonism.Procyclidine has an atropine-like action on parasympathetic-innervated peripheral structures including smooth muscle. It's antispasmodic effects are thought to be related to the blockage of central cholinergic receptors M1, M2 and M4. It is used to treat symptomatic Parkinsonism and extrapyramidal dysfunction caused by antipsychotic agents.The mechanism of action is unknown. It is thought that Procyclidine acts by blocking central cholinergic receptors, and thus balancing cholinergic and dopaminergic activity in the basal ganglia. Procyclidine exerts an antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle, and may produce mydriasis and reduction in salivation."
313,DB00388,"The ophthalmic formulation is indicated to induce mydriasis  and conjunctival vasoconstriction. Off-label uses include priapism and induction of local vasoconstriction.Phenylephrine is an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonist used to treat hypotension, dilate the pupil, and induce local vasoconstriction. The action of phenylephrine, or neo-synephrine, was first described in literature in the 1930s. Phenylephrine was granted FDA approval in 1939.Phenylephrine is an alpha-1 adrenergic agonist that raises blood pressure, dilates the pupils, and causes local vasoconstriction. Patients taking an intravenous formulation should be counselled regarding the risk of bradycardia, allergic reactions, extravasation causing necrosis or tissue sloughing, and the concomitant use of oxytocic drugs.Phenylephrine is an alpha-1 adrenergic agonist that mediates vasoconstriction and mydriasis depending on the route and location of administration."

It is a common agent used to manage atrial fibrillation and the symptoms of heart failure. They were one of the first to prescribe cardiac glycosides, according to ancient literature dating as early as the 1250s.Digoxin is a positive inotropic and negative chronotropic drug, meaning that it increases the force of the heartbeat and decreases the heart rate. Cardiac arrest as a result of ventricular fibrillation is fatal. Digoxin exerts hemodynamic, electrophysiologic, and neurohormonal effects on the cardiovascular system."
316,DB00391,"Sulpiride is indicated for the treatment of acute and chronic schizophrenia.Sulpiride first appeared in published literature in 1967. Clinical studies show a greater effect on treating the negative symptoms of schizophrenia rather than positive symptoms at low doses, though the effects are more equal at higher doses. It has a short duration of action as it is given twice daily, and a wide therapeutic window as patients have survived single doses as high as 16g. Patients should be counselled regarding increased motor agitation, extrapyramidal reactions, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome.Sulpiride is a selective dopamine D2 and D3 receptor antagonist. It is estimated that D2 receptors should be 65-80% occupied for optimal treatment and minimal adverse effects."
317,DB00392,"It is sold under the trade name Parsitan in Canada. In the US, the marketing of profenamine has been discontinued.Profenamine, a phenothiazine and antidyskinetic, is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Profenamine also has a slight antihistaminic and local anesthetic effect.Profenamine's anti-Parkinson action can be attributed to its anticholinergic properties. Profenamine's local anesthetic effect is due to its antagonism of the NMDA glutamate receptor. Glutamate is recognized as an important transmitter in nociceptive pathways, and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of the glutamate receptor, in particular, has been implicated in the mediation of neuropathic pain."
318,DB00393,"For use as an adjunct to improve neurologic outcome following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) from ruptured intracranial berry aneurysms by reducing the incidence and severity of ischemic deficits.Nimodipine is a 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. By inhibiting the influx of calcium in smooth muscle cells, nimodipine prevents calcium-dependent smooth muscle contraction and subsequent vasoconstriction. Nimodipine inhibits calcium ion transfer into these cells and thus inhibits contractions of vascular smooth muscle. In animal experiments, nimodipine had a greater effect on cerebral arteries than on arteries elsewhere in the body perhaps because it is highly lipophilic, allowing it to cross the blood brain barrier. By specifically binding to L-type voltage-gated calcium channels, nimodipine inhibits the calcium ion transfer, resulting in the inhibition of vascular smooth muscle contraction."
319,DB00394,"Indicated for the relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses in patients 13 years of age and older. Formulations for oral inhalation, intranasal, and topical use are available for beclomethasone dipropionate. When inhaled, it is proposed that beclomethasone dipropionate remains active locally in the lung without causing significant side effects associated with systemic corticosteroids. Although inhaled corticosteroids, including beclomethasone dipropionate, are reported to mainly act locally in the lungs, systemic effects such as disruption of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function, bone turnover, osteoporosis, and growth suppression may still be observed with chronic use or high dose administration. Corticosteroids were also shown to inhibit the expression of multiple genes that encode pro-inflammatory factors, such as cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules, that are activated during the chronic inflammatory process."

Progesterone is used in various contraceptive preparations to prevent ovulation and fertilization ,  as well as in other formulations to promote and support pregnancy. It acts on the uterus by changing the proliferative phase to the secretory phase of the endometrium (inner mucous lining of the uterus). This hormone, stimulated by a hormone called _luteinizing hormone_ (LH) is the main hormone during the secretory phase to prepare the corpus luteum and the endometrium for implantation of a fertilized ovum."
322,DB00397,"For the treatment of nasal congestion, control of urinary incontinence, priapism and obesity.Phenylpropanolamine is a sympathomimetic agent that acts as a nonselective adrenergic receptor agonist and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. It has been used as a decongestant and appetite suppressant. Currently, it is withdrawn from the market in Canada and the United States due to the risk for hemorrahgic strokes.Phenylpropanolamine (PPA), a sympathomimetic agent structurally similar to pseudoephedrine, is used to treat nasal congestion. Phenylpropanolamine is found in appetite suppressant formulations and with guaifenesinin in cough-cold formulations. In 2000, the FDA requested that all drug companies discontinue marketing products containing phenylpropanolamine, due to an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke in women who used phenylpropanolamine.Phenylpropanolamine acts directly on alpha- and, to a lesser degree, beta-adrenergic receptors in the mucosa of the respiratory tract."
323,DB00398,"Sorafenib is indicated for the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and advanced renal cell carcinoma. It targets cell surface tyrosine kinase receptors and downstream intracellular kinases that are implicated in tumour cell proliferation and tumour angiogenesis. First approved by the FDA and European Commission in 2007 for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, sorafenib is also indicated to treat renal carcinoma and differentiated thyroid carcinoma.Sorafenib decreases tumour cell proliferation _in vitro_. It attenuated tumour growth of human tumour xenografts in immunocompromised mice, reduced tumour angiogenesis, and increased tumour apoptosis in models of hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, and differentiated thyroid carcinoma.

Zoledronic acid was granted FDA approval on 20 August 2001.Zoledronic acid is a third generation, nitrogen containing bisphosphonate that inhibits osteoclast function and prevents bone resorption. Bone resorption by osteoclasts causes local acidification, releasing the bisphosphonate, which is taken into the osteoclast by fluid-phase endocytosis. Endocytic vesicles become acidified, releasing bisphosphonates into the cytosol of osteoclasts where they act. Disruption of the podosomes causes osteoclasts to detach from bones, preventing bone resorption."

Griseofulvin is fungistatic with in vitro activity against various species of Microsporum Epidermophyton, and Trichophyton. It has no effect on bacteria or on other genera of fungi. Once the keratin-Griseofulvin complex reaches the skin site of action, it binds to fungal microtubules (tubulin) thus altering fungal mitosis.Griseofulvin is fungistatic, however the exact mechanism by which it inhibits the growth of dermatophytes is not clear. It binds to keratin in human cells, then once it reaches the fungal site of action, it binds to fungal microtubes thus altering the fungal process of mitosis."
326,DB00401,"For the treatment of hypertension.Nisoldipine is a 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. It acts primarily on vascular smooth muscle cells by stabilizing voltage-gated L-type calcium channels in their inactive conformation. Nisoldipine may be used in alone or in combination with other agents in the management of hypertension.Nisoldipine, a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker, is used alone or with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, to treat hypertension, chronic stable angina pectoris, and Prinzmetal's variant angina. Nisoldipine is similar to other peripheral vasodilators. Nisoldipine inhibits the influx of extra cellular calcium across the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes possibly by deforming the channel, inhibiting ion-control gating mechanisms, and/or interfering with the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum."
327,DB00402,"One major benefit of eszopiclone is that it is approved by the FDA for the long-term treatment of insomnia. Eszopiclone was initially approved by the FDA in 2004.Eszopiclone rapidly induces sleep and decreases sleep latency. These include changes in alertness and motor coordination and the risk of next morning impairment, increasing with the amount of eszopiclone administered. Use the smallest dose of eszopiclone as possible, especially in elderly patients, who may experience exaggerated drug effects. Though the potential for dependence and abuse with eszopiclone is lower than for other hypnotic drugs, this drug has been abused and is known to cause dependence.The exact mechanism of action of eszopiclone is unknown at this time but is thought to occur via binding with the GABA receptor complexes at binding sites located near benzodiazepine receptors, possibly explaining its hypnotic and sedative effects."
328,DB00404,"Alprazolam was given FDA approval on October 16, 1981.Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine that binds Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type-A receptors (GABAARs) to enhance their inhibitory effect on neurotransmission, specifically in the brain; Patients with pre-existing impaired respiratory function are at increased risk of adverse effects including death during treatment with benzodiazepines. As CYP3A is required for the initial step in alprazolam metabolism, alprazolam is contraindicated in patients taking strong CYP3A inhibitors, such as ketoconazole and itraconazole; milder CYP3A inhibitors still necessitate alprazolam dosage adjustments. The most prevalent GABAARs _in vivo_ are the Î±1Î²2Î³2 receptors, which contain both GABA (Î²+/Î±-) and benzodiazepine (BZD, Î±+/Î³-) binding sites in the intersubunit interfaces of the relevant subunits. The binding of alprazolam in the high-affinity BZD site stabilizes the Î±+/Î³- interface and facilitates the conformational changes that lead to pore opening, hence functioning as a positive allosteric modulator. Earlier studies suggested that the primary factor was the Î± subunit composition, with Î±1-containing receptors mediating the sedative effects, Î±2/3-containing receptors the anxiolytic effects, and Î±5-containing receptors the memory effects of benzodiazepines."
329,DB00405,"Once the mast cell-antibody-antigen complex is formed, a complex series of events occurs that eventually leads to cell-degranulation and the release of histamine (and other chemical mediators) from the mast cell or basophil. Once released, histamine can react with local or widespread tissues through histamine receptors. Histamine, acting on H<sub>1</sub>-receptors, produces pruritis, vasodilatation, hypotension, flushing, headache, tachycardia, and bronchoconstriction. Histamine also increases vascular permeability and potentiates pain. It provides effective, temporary relief of sneezing, watery and itchy eyes, and runny nose due to hay fever and other upper respiratory allergies.Dexbrompheniramine competitively binds to the histamine H<sub>1</sub>-receptor."

Ardeparin is derived via peroxide degradation of heparin extracted from porcine intestinal mucosa. Its molecular weight ranges from 2000 to 15,000 with an average molecular weight of 5500 to 6500. It acts at multiple sites in the normal coagulation system to inhibit reactions that lead to the clotting of blood and the formation of fibrin clots both in vitro and in vivo.Ardeparin binds to antithrombin III, accelerating its activity in inactivating factor Xa and thrombin, thereby inhibiting thrombosis. Ardeparin does not effect prothrombin time (PT) assays and may prolong activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT)."
331,DB00408,"For the management of the manifestations of psychotic disorders such as schizophreniaAn antipsychotic agent used in schizophrenia. Loxapine, a dibenzoxazepine compound, represents a subclass of tricyclic antipsychotic agents, chemically distinct from the thioxanthenes, butyrophenones, and phenothiazines. Pharmacologically, Loxapine is a tranquilizer for which the exact mode of action has not been established, however, it is believed that by antagonising dopamine and serotonin receptors, there is a marked cortical inhibition which can manifest as tranquilization and suppression of aggression.Loxapine is a dopamine antagonist, and also a serotonin 5-HT2 blocker. The exact mode of action of Loxapine has not been established, however changes in the level of excitability of subcortical inhibitory areas have been observed in several animal species in association with such manifestations of tranquilization as calming effects and suppression of aggressive behavior."
332,DB00409,"Remoxipride is an atypical antipsychotic once used for the treatment of schizophrenia.Remoxipride is an atypical antipsychotic agent that is specific for dopamine D2 receptors. It gained approval in the UK in 1989 but was withdrawn in 1993 after it was found to be associated with an increased incidence of aplastic anemia.Remoxipride is a weak selective dopamine D2 receptor antagonist that was once used in the treatment of schizophrenia. It has a moderate therapeutic index and duration of action. This weaker binding is thought to account for the reduced incidence of Parkinsonism. Remoxipride also increases expression of the protein _Fos_ in the nucleus accumbens but not the dorsolateral striatum, which may be responsible for a reduced incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms."

Carbamoylcholine was initially used as a treatment for migraines, induction of diuresis, and other parasympathetic effects. Carbamoylcholine was granted FDA approval on 28 September 1972.Carbamoylcholine is a parasympathomimetic that acts as an agonist of muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. It is more resistant to hydrolysis by acetylcholinesterase than other choline esters leading to a longer duration of action, with significant effects 24 hours after administration. Data regarding the therapeutic index of carbamoylcholine is not readily available."
335,DB00412,"Like other thiazolidinediones, the mechanism of action of rosiglitazone is by activation of the intracellular receptor class of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), specifically PPARÎ³. Rosiglitazone is a selective ligand of PPARÎ³, and has no PPARÎ±-binding action. This is the subject of a clinical trial currently underway.When rosiglitazone is used as monotherapy, it is associated with increases in total cholesterol, LDL, and HDL. As a result, the LDL/HDL ratio peaked after 2 months of therapy and then appeared to decrease over time. Rosiglitazone acts as a highly selective and potent agonist at peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPAR) in target tissues for insulin action such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver."
336,DB00413,"This drug can be administered as monotherapy or in conjunction with levodopa. In addition to the above FDA approval for Parkinson's Disease, pramipexole was also approved by the FDA in 2006 for the treatment of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) . The motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease occur partly due to a reduction of dopamine in the substantia nigra of the brain . The exact mechanism of action of pramipexole as a treatment for Parkinson's disease is unknown at this time. Pramipexole is considered a non-ergot dopamine agonist that shows specificity and strong activity at the D2 subfamily of dopamine receptors in vitro, binding selectively and dopamine D2 receptors and showing a preference for the dopamine D3 receptor subtype rather than other subtypes ."
337,DB00414,"Acetohexamide has been discontinued in the US market.Acetohexamide is an intermediate-acting, first-generation oral sulfonylurea. It lowers blood sugar by stimulating the pancreatic beta cells to secrete insulin and by helping the body use insulin efficiently. Due to its primary action on the pancreatic beta cells, the drug is only effective when there are functional pancreatic beta cells that can produce insulin granules. Acetohexamide has one-third the potency of chlorpropamide, and twice the potency of tolbutamide; however, similar hypoglycemic efficacy occurs with equipotent dosage of sulfonylureas.Sulfonylureas such as acetohexamide bind to an ATP-dependent K+ channel on the cell membrane of pancreatic beta cells. This inhibits a tonic, hyperpolarizing outflux of potassium, which causes the electric potential over the membrane to become more positive."

The name ""penicillin"" can either refer to several variants of penicillin available, or to the group of antibiotics derived from the penicillins. Ampicillin has <i>in vitro</i> activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The bactericidal activity of Ampicillin results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis and is mediated through Ampicillin binding to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). Ampicillin is stable against hydrolysis by a variety of beta-lactamases, including penicillinases, and cephalosporinases and extended spectrum beta-lactamases.By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, Ampicillin inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis."
339,DB00416,"For use as an anesthesia adjunct to induce skeletal muscle relaxation and to reduce the intensity of muscle contractions in convulsive therapy.Metocurine iodide is a benzylisoquinolinium competitive nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent. It is used as an anesthesia adjunct to induce skeletal muscle relaxation and to reduce the intensity of muscle contractions in convulsive therapy Metocurine iodide has a moderate risk of inducing histamine release and has some ganglion blocking activity. As with other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers, the time to onset of paralysis decreases and the duration of maximum effect increases with increasing doses of metocurine iodide. Repeated administration of maintenance doses of metocurine iodide has no cumulative effect on the duration of neuromuscular block if recovery is allowed to begin prior to repeat dosing.

341,DB00418,"For the Short-term treatment of intractable insomnia for patients habituated to barbituratesSecobarbital (marketed by Eli Lilly and Company under the brand names Seconal and Tuinal) is a barbiturate derivative drug with anaesthetic, anticonvulsant, sedative and hypnotic properties. It is commonly known as quinalbarbitone in the United Kingdom.Secobarbital, a barbiturate, is used for the induction of anesthesia prior to the use of other general anesthetic agents and for induction of anesthesia for short surgical, diagnostic, or therapeutic procedures associated with minimal painful stimuli. Little analgesia is conferred by barbiturates; their use in the presence of pain may result in excitation.Secobarbital binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl- ionopore at the GABAAreceptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl- ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged."
342,DB00420,"Also used to treat agitation or restlessness in the elderly.A phenothiazine with actions similar to chlorpromazine but with less antipsychotic activity. When there is an excess amount of dopamine in the brain it causes over-stimulation of dopamine receptors. Promazine has weak extrapyramidal and autonomic side effects which lead to its use in the elderly, for restless or psychotic patients. Its anti-psychotic effect is also weaker and it is not useful in general psychiatry.Promazine is an antagonist at types 1, 2, and 4 dopamine receptors, 5-HT receptor types 2A and 2C, muscarinic receptors 1 through 5, alpha(1)-receptors, and histamine H1-receptors. Promazine's antipsychotic effect is due to antagonism at dopamine and serotonin type 2 receptors, with greater activity at serotonin 5-HT2 receptors than at dopamine type-2 receptors."

It is aimed for use in patients with difficulties initiating sleep. Due to the above effects, the FDA has recommended an initial dose of zolpidem (immediate-acting) is a single dose of 5 mg for women and a single dose of 5 or 10 mg for men, immediately before bedtime with at least 7-8 hours remaining before the planned time of awakening . The main regulatory site of the GABAA receptor complex can be found on its _alpha (Î±) subunit_ and is called the _benzodiazepine_ (BZ) or _omega (Ï)_ receptor."
348,DB00426,"For the treatment of acute herpes zoster (shingles). Also for the treatment or suppression of recurrent genital herpes in immunocompetent patients and treatment of recurrent mucocutaneous herpes simplex infections in HIV infected patients.Famciclovir, marketed as Famvir by Novartis, is a guanine analogue used to treat herpes virus infections. It is most commonly used to treat herpes zoster (shingles). Therefore, herpes viral DNA synthesis and replication are selectively inhibited.Famciclovir undergoes rapid biotransformation to the active antiviral compound penciclovir, which has inhibitory activity against herpes simplex virus types 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2) and varicella zoster virus (VZV). In cells infected with HSV-1, HSV-2 or VZV, viral thymidine kinase phosphorylates penciclovir to a monophosphate form that, in turn, is converted to penciclovir triphosphate by cellular kinases."
349,DB00427,"Also used in combination with other agents for the symptomatic relief of symptoms associated with the common cold.First generation histamine H1 antagonist used in allergic rhinitis; asthma; and urticaria. It is a component of cough and cold medicines. It may cause drowsiness.In allergic reactions an allergen interacts with and cross-links surface IgE antibodies on mast cells and basophils. Once released, histamine can react with local or widespread tissues through histamine receptors. Triprolidine, is a histamine H1 antagonist that competes with histamine for the normal H1-receptor sites on effector cells of the gastrointestinal tract, blood vessels and respiratory tract."
350,DB00428,"It is used as an antineoplastic agent and to induce diabetes in experimental animals.Streptozocin is an antitumour antibiotic consisting of a nitrosourea moiety interposed between a methyl group and a glucosamine. Streptozocin is indicated in the treatment of metastatic islet cell carcinoma of the pancreas. Streptozocin inhibits DNA synthesis in bacterial and mammalian cells. Although streptozocin inhibits the progression of cells into mitosis, no specific phase of the cell cycle is particularly sensitive to its lethal effects.Although its mechanism of action is not completely clear, streptozocin is known to inhibit DNA synthesis, interfere with biochemical reactions of NAD and NADH, and inhibit some enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis. Its activity appears to occur as a result of formation of methylcarbonium ions, which alkylate or bind with many intracellular molecular structures including nucleic acids."
351,DB00429,Inadvertent or spontaneous rupture of membranes in the presence of a previable fetus and absence of adequate activity for expulsion. Also for the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony which has not responded to conventional methods of management.A nonsteroidal abortifacient agent that is effective in both the first and second trimesters of pregnancy.Carboprost tromethamine administered intramuscularly stimulates in the gravid uterus myometrial contractions similar to labor contractions at the end of a full term pregnancy. This activity may produce the vomiting or diarrhea or both that is common when carbo-prost tromethamine is used to terminate pregnancy and for use postpartum. In laboratory animals and also in humans carboprost tromethamine can elevate body temperature. In laboratory animals and also in humans carboprost tromethamine can elevate body temperature.
352,DB00430,"For treatment of severe infections caused by susceptible bacteria such as P. aeruginosa.Cefpiramide is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic.Cefpiramide is a cephalosporin active against <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. It has a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. Cefpiramide works by inhibiting bacterial cell wall biosynthesis. The plasma half-lives of cefpiramide in rabbits, dogs, and rhesus monkeys were much longer than those of cefoperazone and cefazolin.The bactericidal activity of cefpiramide results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs)."
353,DB00431,"For the treatment of patients infested with Sarcoptes scabiei or pediculosis capitis who have either failed to respond to adequate doses, or are intolerant of other approved therapies.An organochlorine insecticide that has been used as a pediculicide and a scabicide. In Canada, Lindane is not recommmended as a first-line therapy due to reports of resistance, neurotoxicity, and bone marrow suppression, but has been approved by the FDA as a second-line therapy for topical treatment of pediculosis capitis (head lice), pediculosis pubis (pubic lice), or scabies in patients greater than two years of age who cannot tolerate or have failed first-line treatment. It is a very contagious condition with specific lesions, such as burrows, and nonspecific lesions, such as papules, vesicles and excoriations. The typical areas of the body it affects are finger webs, scalp (hair), wrists, axillary folds, abdomen, buttocks, inframammary folds and genitalia (males). It is characterized by intense night-time itching."
354,DB00432,"In the anticancer therapy, trifluridine acts as a thymidine-based nucleoside metabolic inhibitor that gets incorporated into DNA of cancer cells following cell uptake to aberrate DNA function during cell replication .Trifluridine exhibits an antiviral effect against herpes simplex virus, types 1 and 2 and vacciniavirus both in vitro and in vivo . The cytotoxic activity of trifluridine and tipiracil against several human tumour xenografts show high correlation with the amount of trifluridine incorporated into DNA, indicating that the primary mechanism of action of trifluridine involves the direct incorporation into the cancer cell DNA . In clinical studies comprised of patients with previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer, treatment of trifluridine in combination with tipiracil in addition to best supportive care over a 5- or 7-month period resulted in increased progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) compared to placebo . The mechanism of action of trifluridine as an antiviral agent has not been fully elucidated, but appears to involve the inhibition of viral replication. Trifluridine monophosphate also reversibly inhibits thymidylate synthetase (TS), an enzyme that is necessary for DNA synthesis and which levels are shown to be elevated different cancer cell lines ."
355,DB00433,"The use of prochlorperazine for the management of generalized non-psychotic anxiety is typically not a first-line therapy and should be limited to doses of less than 20 mg per day or for shorter than 12 weeks. Prochlorperazine, also known as compazine, is a piperazine phenothiazine and first-generation antipsychotic drug that is used for the treatment of severe nausea and vomiting, as well as short-term management of psychotic disorders such as generalized non-psychotic anxiety and schizophrenia. It also exerts its anti-emetic actions via anti-dopaminergic effects, where it displays similar efficacy as ondansteron, a 5HT-3 receptor antagonist and anti-emetic, in preventing delayed nausea and vomiting. Inhibition of D2 receptor signaling results in the blockade of postsynaptic dopamine receptors in the mesolimbic system  and an increased dopamine turnover. Prochlorperazine exerts antiemetic effects and was shown to inhibit apomorphine-induced vomiting by blocking D2 dopamine receptors in the CTZ.."
356,DB00434,"In the US, prescription cyproheptadine is indicated for the treatment of various allergic symptomatologies - including dermatographia, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and urticaria - as well as adjunctive therapy in the management of anaphylaxis following treatment with epinephrine. In Canada, cyproheptadine is available over-the-counter and is indicated for the treatment of pruritus and for appetite stimulation. In Australia, cyproheptadine is additionally indicated for the treatment vascular headaches. Cyproheptadine is also used off-label for the treatment of serotonin syndrome.Cyproheptadine is a potent competitive antagonist of both serotonin and histamine receptors. It is used primarily to treat allergic symptoms, though it is perhaps more notable for its use in appetite stimulation and its off-label use in the treatment of serotonin syndrome.Cyproheptadine has been observed to antagonize several pharmacodynamic effects of serotonin in laboratory animals, including bronchoconstriction and vasodepression, and has demonstrated similar efficacy in antagonizing histamine-mediated effects."
357,DB00435,"This gas is an important signaling molecule in the body of mammals including humans and is an extremely important intermediate in the chemical industry. Nitric oxide (NO) should not be confused with nitrous oxide (N2O), a general anaesthetic, or with nitrogen dioxide (NO2) which is another poisonous air pollutant. The nitric oxide molecule is a free radical, which is relevant to understanding its high reactivity. It reacts with the ozone in air to form nitrogen dioxide, signalled by the appearance of the reddish-brown color.Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) occurs as a primary developmental defect or as a condition secondary to other diseases such as meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS), pneumonia, sepsis, hyaline membrane disease, congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), and pulmonary hypoplasia. In these states, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is high, which results in hypoxemia secondary to right-to-left shunting of blood through the patent ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale."
358,DB00436,"For the treatment of high blood pressure and management of edema related to heart failure.A thiazide diuretic with actions and uses similar to those of hydrochlorothiazide. Thiazides are often used to treat hypertension, but their hypotensive effects are not necessarily due to their diuretic activity. Thiazides cause vasodilation by activating calcium-activated potassium channels (large conductance) in vascular smooth muscles and inhibiting various carbonic anhydrases in vascular tissue.As a diuretic, bendroflumethiazide inhibits active chloride reabsorption at the early distal tubule via the Na-Cl cotransporter, resulting in an increase in the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water. Thiazides like bendroflumethiazide also inhibit sodium ion transport across the renal tubular epithelium through binding to the thiazide sensitive sodium-chloride transporter. The antihypertensive mechanism of bendroflumethiazide is less well understood although it may be mediated through its action on carbonic anhydrases in the smooth muscle or through its action on the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (KCa) channel, also found in the smooth muscle."
359,DB00437,"Allopurinol is indicated in :    1) the management of patients with signs and symptoms of primary or secondary gout (acute attacks, tophi, joint destruction, uric acid lithiasis, and/or nephropathy). 2) the management of patients with leukemia, lymphoma and malignancies who are receiving cancer therapy which causes elevations of serum and urinary uric acid levels. Allopurinol and its active metabolite inhibit xanthine oxidase, the enzyme that converts hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid. Accompanying the reduction of serum uric acid by allopurinol is an increase in the serum and urine concentrations of hypoxanthine and xanthine (due to inhibition of xanthine oxidase). Although the levels of hypoxanthine and xanthine are found to be increased after allopurinol ingestion, the risk of deposition in renal tissues is less than that of uric acid, as they become more soluble and are rapidly excreted by the kidney ."
360,DB00438,"In all cases, to mitigate the risk of bacterial resistance and preserve clinical efficacy, ceftazidime should only be used for infections that are confirmed or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacterial strains.Bacteria possess a cell wall comprising a glycopeptide polymer commonly known as peptidoglycan, which is synthesized and remodelled through the action of a family of enzymes known as ""penicillin-binding proteins"" (PBPs). Î²-lactam antibiotics, including cephalosporins, are PBP inhibitors that, through inhibition of essential PBPs, result in impaired cell wall homeostasis, loss of cell integrity, and ultimately bacterial cell death. Ceftazidime has confirmed activity against clinically relevant Gram-negative bacteria including _Citrobacter_ spp., _Enterobacter_ spp., _Klebsiella_ spp., _Proteus_ spp., _Serratia spp., _Escherichia coli_, _Haemophilus influenzae_, _Neisseria meningitidis_, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, and some Gram-positive bacteria including _Staphylococcus_ spp. There are also _in vitro_ data for ceftazidime efficacy against a wide variety of other bacteria, such as _Acinetobacter baumannii_ and _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_, but no clear clinical studies to support the use of ceftazidime for infections caused by these bacteria. _In vitro_ experiments in Gram-negative bacteria such as _Escherichia coli_, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, _Acinetobacter baumannii_, and _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ suggest that ceftazidime primarily binds to PBP3, with weaker binding to PBP1a/1b and PBP2 as well; although binding to other PBPs, such as PBP4, is detectable, the concentrations required are much greater than those achieved clinically."
361,DB00439,"Used as an adjunct to diet for the reduction of elevated total and LDL cholesterol levels in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb) when the response to dietary restriction of saturated fat and cholesterol and other non-pharmacological measures alone has been inadequate.On August 8, 2001 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that Bayer Pharmaceutical Division voluntarily withdrew Baycol from the U.S. market, due to reports of fatal rhabdomyolysis, a severe adverse reaction from this cholesterol-lowering (lipid-lowering) product. It has also been withdrawn from the Canadian market.Cerivastatin, a competitive HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor effective in lowering LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, is used to treat primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia (Fredrickson types IIa and IIb).Cerivastatin competitively inhibits hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the hepatic enzyme responsible for converting HMG-CoA to mevalonate. As mevalonate is a precursor of sterols such as cholesterol, this results in a decrease in cholesterol in hepatic cells, upregulation of LDL-receptors, and an increase in hepatic uptake of LDL-cholesterol from the circulation."

Trimethoprim is available as an ophthalmic solution  for the treatment of acute bacterial conjunctivitis, blepharitis, and blepharoconjunctivitis caused by susceptible bacteria.Trimethoprim is an antifolate antibacterial agent that inhibits bacterial dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), a critical enzyme that catalyzes the formation of tetrahydrofolic acid (THF) - in doing so, it prevents the synthesis of bacterial DNA and ultimately continued bacterial survival.  Trimethoprim is often given  which inhibits the preceding step in bacterial protein synthesis - given together, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim inhibit two consecutive steps in the biosynthesis of bacterial nucleic acids and proteins. As a monotherapy trimethoprim is considered bacteriostatic, but in combination with sulfamethoxazole is thought to exert bactericidal activity."
363,DB00441,"Gemcitabine is indicated for patients previously treated with .Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analog and a chemotherapeutic agent. As a prodrug, gemcitabine is transformed into its active metabolites that work by replacing the building blocks of nucleic acids during DNA elongation, arresting tumour growth and promoting apoptosis of malignant cells. It is also being investigated in other cancer and tumour types.Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analog that mediates its antitumour effects by promoting apoptosis of malignant cells undergoing DNA synthesis. In patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, objective response rates in patients ranged from 5.to 12%, with a median survival duration of 3.9 to 6.3 months. In Phase II trials involving patients with metastatic breast cancer, treatment with gemcitabine alone or with adjuvant chemotherapies resulted in response rate ranging from 13 to 42% and median survival duration ranging from 11.5 to 17.8 months."
364,DB00442,"It is marketed under the trade name Baraclude (BMS). Entecavir is a guanine analogue that inhibits all three steps in the viral replication process, and the manufacturer claims that it is more efficacious than previous agents used to treat hepatitis B (lamivudine and adefovir). It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2005.Entecavir is a guanosine nucleoside analogue with selective activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV). It is designed to selectively inhibit the Hepatitis B virus, blocking all three steps in the replication process. Entecavir is more efficient than an older Hepatitis B drug, lamivudine.By competing with the natural substrate deoxyguanosine triphosphate, entecavir functionally inhibits all three activities of the HBV polymerase (reverse transcriptase, rt): (1) base priming, (2) reverse transcription of the negative strand from the pregenomic messenger RNA, and (3) synthesis of the positive strand of HBV DNA."
365,DB00443,"As a member of the corticosteroid family, betamethasone is indicated for the treatment of several inflammatory conditions. Betamethasone has potent glucocorticoid activity and negligible mineralocorticoid activity.Corticosteroids bind to the glucocorticoid receptor inhibiting pro-inflammatory signals, while promoting anti-inflammatory signals. Corticosteroids have a wide therapeutic window as patients may require doses that are multiples of what the body naturally produces. In addition, glucocorticoids promote anti-inflammatory genes like interleukin-10. Corticosteroids like betamethasone can act through nongenomic and genomic pathways."
366,DB00444,"Teniposide is used for the treatment of refractory acute lymphoblastic leukaemiaTeniposide is a semisynthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin that exhibits antitumor activity. Teniposide inhibits DNA synthesis by forming a complex with topoisomerase II and DNA. This complex induces breaks in double stranded DNA and prevents repair by topoisomerase II binding. Accumulated breaks in DNA prevent cells from entering into the mitotic phase of the cell cycle, and lead to cell death. Teniposide acts primarily in the G2 and S phases of the cycle.Teniposide is a phase-specific cytotoxic drug, acting in the late S or early G 2 phase of the cell cycle."
367,DB00445,"For use as a component of adjuvant therapy in patients with evidence of axillary node tumor involvement following resection of primary breast cancer.An anthracycline which is the 4&#39;-epi-isomer of doxorubicin. The compound exerts its antitumor effects by interference with the synthesis and function of DNA.Epirubicin is an antineoplastic in the anthracycline class. General properties of drugs in this class include: interaction with DNA in a variety of different ways including intercalation (squeezing between the base pairs), DNA strand breakage and inhibition with the enzyme topoisomerase II. Most of these compounds have been isolated from natural sources and antibiotics. It also interferes with DNA replication and transcription by inhibiting DNA helicase activity."

It is also used in eye drops or ointment to treat bacterial conjunctivitis.An antibiotic first isolated from cultures of _Streptomyces venezuelae_ in 1947 but now produced synthetically. It acts by interfering with bacterial protein synthesis and is mainly bacteriostatic. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 29th ed, p106)    The FDA has withdrawn all oral drug products containing chloramphenicol, due to the high risk of fatal aplastic anemia associated with this specific route of administration.Chloramphenicol is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that was derived from the bacterium Streptomyces venezuelae and is now produced synthetically. Chloramphenicol stops bacterial growth by binding to the bacterial ribosome (blocking peptidyl transferase) and inhibiting protein synthesis.Chloramphenicol is lipid-soluble, allowing it to diffuse through the bacterial cell membrane."

It is marketed under the trade name Lorabid.Loracarbef is considered a second generation cephalosporin antibiotic. Loracarbef has a spectrum of activity similar to that of the second generation cephalosporins. It is structurally identical to cefaclor except for a sulfur atom that has been replaced by a methylene group."
370,DB00448,"Lansoprazole is used to reduce gastric acid secretion and is approved for short term treatment of active gastric ulcers, active duodenal ulcers, erosive reflux oesophagitis, symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) induced gastric and duodenal ulcers. It may be used in the maintenance and healing of several gastric conditions including duodenal ulcers, NSAID related gastric ulcers, and erosive esophagitis. Lansoprazole is effective at eradicating H. pylori when used in conjunction with amoxicillin and clarithromycin (triple therapy) or with amoxicillin alone (dual therapy). Conveniently, lansoprazole administered any time of day is able to inhibit both daytime and nocturnal acid secretion. The result is that lansoprazole is effective at healing duodenal ulcers, reduces ulcer-related pain, and offers relief from symptoms of heartburn   Lansoprazole also reduces pepsin secretion, making it a useful treatment option for hypersecretory conditions such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.As a PPI, lansoprazole is a prodrug and requires protonation via an acidic environment to become activated."
371,DB00449,"Dipivefrin is a prodrug which is used as initial therapy for the control of intraocular pressure in chronic open-angle glaucoma.Dipivefrin is a prodrug of adrenaline, which is used to treat glaucoma. It is available as ophthalmic solution (eye drops).Dipivefrin is a member of a class of drugs known as prodrugs. Prodrugs are usually not active in themselves and require biotransformation to the parent compound before therapeutic activity is seen. The addition of pivaloyl groups to the epinephrine molecule enhances its lipophilic character and, as a consequence, its penetration into the anterior chamber.Dipivefrin is a prodrug with little or no pharmacologically activity until it is hydrolyzed into epinephrine inside the human eye. The dipivefrin prodrug delivery system is a more efficient way of delivering the therapeutic effects of epinephrine, with fewer side effects than are associated with conventional epinephrine therapy."
372,DB00450,"Droperidol is used to produce tranquilization and to reduce the incidence of nausea and vomiting in surgical and diagnostic procedures.A butyrophenone with general properties similar to those of haloperidol. It is used in conjunction with an opioid analgesic such as fentanyl to maintain the patient in a calm state of neuroleptanalgesia with indifference to surroundings but still able to cooperate with the surgeon. (From Martindale, The Extra  Pharmacopoeia, 29th ed, p593)Droperidol produces marked tranquilization and sedation. Droperidol potentiates other CNS depressants. It can produce hypotension and decreased peripheral vascular resistance and may decrease pulmonary arterial pressure (particularly if it is abnormally high)."
373,DB00451,"While T4 is the major product secreted by the thyroid gland,  T3 exerts the majority of the physiological effects of the thyroid hormones; T4and T3 have a relative potency of ~1:4 (T4:T3). TSH levels should be monitored at least yearly to avoid over-treating with levothyroxine which can result in hyperthyroidism (TSH <0.1mIU/L) and symptoms of increased heart rate, diarrhea, tremor, hypercalcemia, and weakness to name a few. As many cardiac functions including heart rate, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance are closely linked to thyroid status, over-treatment with levothyroxine may result in increases in heart rate, cardiac wall thickness, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease and in elderly patients. In populations with any cardiac concerns, levothyroxine should be initiated at lower doses than those recommended in younger individuals or in patients without cardiac disease. Thyroxine is released from its precursor protein thyroglobulin through proteolysis and secreted into the blood where is it then peripherally deiodinated to form triiodothyronine (T3ï¼which exerts a broad spectrum of stimulatory effects on cell metabolism."

For the prophylaxis of ocular infections following foreign body removalA component of neomycin that is produced by Streptomyces fradiae. On hydrolysis it yields neamine and neobiosamine B. Framycetin works by binding to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit, causing misreading of t-RNA, leaving the bacterium unable to synthesize proteins vital to its growth. This interferes with decoding site in the vicinity of nucleotide 1400 in 16S rRNA of 30S subunit."
375,DB00454,"Meperidine is recommended for relief of moderate to severe acute pain and has the unique ability to interrupt postoperative shivering and shaking chills induced by amphotericin B. Meperidine has also been used for intravenous regional anesthesia, peripheral nerve blocks and intraarticular, epidural and spinal analgesia. Meperidine is considered a second-line agent for the treatment of acute pain.Meperidine is primarily a kappa-opiate receptor agonist and also has local anesthetic effects. Meperidine has more affinity for the kappa-receptor than morphine. Opiate receptors are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as both positive and negative regulators of synaptic transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex."
376,DB00455,"A lack of sedative and CNS adverse effects make loratadine, along with other second generation antihistamines, preferable over their 1st generation counterparts in many clinical situations.Like other 2nd generation antihistamines, loratadine is selective for peripheral H1 receptors. Loratadine does not penetrate effectively into the central nervous system and has poor affinity for CNS H1-receptors. As a result, loratadine exerts it's effect by targeting H1 histamine receptors. Loratadine binds to H1 histamine receptors found on the surface of epithelial cells, endothelial cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, airway cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells among others. Histamine binding to the H1-receptor facilitates cross linking between transmembrane domains III and V, stabilizing the active form of the receptor."

The PBPs are transpeptidases which are vital in peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Therefore, their inhibition prevents this vital cell wall compenent from being properly synthesized."
378,DB00457,"**Effects on blood pressure**    The pharmacodynamic and therapeutic effect of this drug includes is a decrease in blood pressure as well as clinically significant decreases in cardiac output, heart rate, blood flow to the kidney, and glomerular filtration rate. Many of the above effects are due to vasodilation of blood vessels caused by prazosin, resulting in decreased peripheral resistance , . As the blood vessels constrict (narrow), the resistance increases and as they dilate (widen), and peripheral resistance decreases, lowering blood pressure . Alpha-1 receptors are postsynaptic (located after the nerve junction, or space between a nerve fiber and target tissue). Through blood vessel constriction by adrenergic receptor activation, epinephrine and norepinephrine normally act to increase blood pressure ."
379,DB00458,"May also be used off-label to manage panic disorders with or without agoraphobia, as a second line agent for ADHD in children and adolescents, to manage bulimia nervosa, for short-term management of acute depressive episodes in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, for the treatment of acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder, and for symptomatic treatment of postherpetic neuralgia and painful diabetic neuropathy . TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Unlabeled indications include chronic and neuropathic pain (including diabetic neuropathy), panic disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) .Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant with general pharmacological properties similar to those of structurally related tricyclic antidepressant drugs such as amitriptyline and doxepin. Serotonin reuptake targeting agents may also produce a down-regulation in Î²-adrenergic receptors in the brain .Imipramine works by inhibiting the neuronal reuptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin . Slowing the reuptake of these neurotransmitters increases their concentration in the synaptic cleft, producing knock-on effects in protein kinase signalling which is thought to contribute to changes in neurotransmission and brain physiology which relieves symptoms of depression ."
380,DB00459,"For the treatment of severe psoriasis in adults.An oral retinoid effective in the treatment of psoriasis. It is the major metabolite of etretinate with the advantage of a much shorter half-life when compared with etretinate.Acitretin is a retinoid. Retinoids have a structure similar to vitamin A and are involved in the normal growth of skin cells. Acitretin works by inhibiting the excessive cell growth and keratinisation (process by which skin cells become thickened due to the deposition of a protein within them) seen in psoriasis. It therefore reduces the thickening of the skin, plaque formation and scaling.The mechanism of action of acitretin is unknown, however it is believed to work by targeting specific receptors (retinoid receptors such as RXR and RAR) in the skin which help normalize the growth cycle of skin cells."
381,DB00460,"Verteporfin accumulates in these abnormal blood vessels and, when stimulated by nonthermal red light with a wavelength of 693 nm in the presence of oxygen, produces highly reactive short-lived singlet oxygen and other reactive oxygen radicals, resulting in local damage to the endothelium and blockage of the vessels.Verteporfin, otherwise known as benzoporphyrin derivative, is a medication used in conjunction with laser treatment to eliminate the abnormal blood vessels in the eye associated with conditions such as the wet form of macular degeneration. Verteporfin accumulates in these abnormal blood vessels and, when stimulated by nonthermal red light with a wavelength of 693 nm in the presence of oxygen, produces highly reactive short-lived singlet oxygen and other reactive oxygen radicals, resulting in local damage to the endothelium and blockage of the vessels.Verteporfin is transported in the plasma primarily by lipoproteins. Verteporfin appears to somewhat preferentially accumulate in neovasculature, including choroidal neovasculature. However, animal models indicate that the drug is also present in the retina. As singlet oxygen and reactive oxygen radicals are cytotoxic, Verteporfin can also be used to destroy tumor cells."
382,DB00461,"This sensitization occurs through reducing the action potential threshold in peripheral neurons, reducing the intensity of painful stimuli needed to produce a painful sensation. PGE<sub>2</sub> activates the G<sub>q</sub>-coupled EP<sub>1</sub> receptor leading to increased activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C pathway. Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EP<sub>2</sub> receptor which couples to G<sub>s</sub>. PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation through IP, EP<sub>2</sub>, and EP<sub>4</sub> receptors which is believed to be an important activity in the pathology of arthritic conditions. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation."
383,DB00462,"Also used to treat nausea and vomiting due to motion sickness.A muscarinic antagonist used to study binding characteristics of muscarinic cholinergic receptors.Methscopolamine is a muscarinic antagonist structurally similar to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and acts by blocking the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and is thus classified as an anticholinergic. It is not clear how Methscopolamine prevents nausea and vomiting due to motion sickness. When a person becomes disoriented due to motion, the vestibule sends a signal through nerves to the vomiting center in the brain, and vomiting occurs. It is believe that Methscopolamine prevents communication between the nerves of the vestibule and the vomiting center in the brain by blocking the action of acetylcholine. Methscopolamine also may work directly on the vomiting center."
384,DB00465,"It is indicated for short term management of acute pain that requires the calibre of pain management offered by opioids. It's analgesic properties make it a useful pain management tool across many settings including postoperative pain, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, menstrual disorders, headaches, spinal and soft tissue pain, and ankylosing spondylitis. Impressively, ketorolac has a similar efficacy to standard doses of morphine and meperidine making it a useful opioid sparing agent.Ketorolac is a non-selective NSAID and acts by inhibiting both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes which are normally responsible for converting arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. As a result, inhibition of the COX-1 enzyme is linked to an increased risk of bleeding and risk of gastric ulceration, while the desired anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties are linked to inhibition of the COX-2 enzyme. The COX-2 enzyme is inducible and is responsible for converting arachidonic acid to prostaglandins that mediate inflammation and pain."
385,DB00467,"For the treatment of adults (&ge;18 years of age) with the following infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms: (1) uncomplicated urethral or cervical gonorrhea due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae, (2) uncomplicated urinary tract infections (cystitis) due to Escherichia coli,Staphylococcus epidermidis, or Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and (3) complicated urinary tract infections due to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis,Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, or Enterobacter cloacae.A broad-spectrum 6-fluoronaphthyridinone antibacterial agent (fluoroquinolones) structurally related to nalidixic acid.Enoxacin is a quinolone/fluoroquinolone antibiotic. Enoxacin is bactericidal and its mode of action depends on blocking of bacterial DNA replication by binding itself to an enzyme called DNA gyrase, which allows the untwisting required to replicate one DNA double helix into two. Enoxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Enoxacin may be active against pathogens resistant to drugs that act by different mechanisms.Enoxacin exerts its bactericidal action via the inhibition of the essential bacterial enzyme DNA gyrase (DNA Topoisomerase II)."
386,DB00468,"Quinine is also a mild antipyretic and analgesic and has been used in common cold preparations for that purpose. It was used commonly and as a bitter and flavoring agent, and is still useful for the treatment of babesiosis. Quinine is also useful in some muscular disorders, especially nocturnal leg cramps and myotonia congenita, because of its direct effects on muscle membrane and sodium channels. However, it has a special place in the management of severe falciparum malaria in areas with known resistance to chloroquine.The theorized mechanism of action for quinine and related anti-malarial drugs is that these drugs are toxic to the malaria parasite. Specifically, the drugs interfere with the parasite's ability to break down and digest hemoglobin."
387,DB00469,"For the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, backache, and pain.Tenoxicam, an antiinflammatory agent with analgesic and antipyretic properties, is used to treat osteoarthritis and control acute pain.Tenoxicam, an antiinflammatory agent with analgesic and antipyretic properties, is used to treat osteoarthritis and control acute pain.The antiinflammatory effects of tenoxicam may result from the inhibition of the enzyme cycooxygenase and the subsequent peripheral inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. As prostaglandins sensitize pain receptors, their inhibition accounts for the peripheral analgesic effects of tenoxicam. Antipyresis may occur by central action on the hypothalamus, resulting in peripheral dilation, increased cutaneous blood flow, and subsequent heat loss."
388,DB00470,"Due to its evidence as an appetite stimulant and an anti-nauseant, Dronabinol is approved for use in anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS and for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments . Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are the two most abundant cannabinoids found naturally in the resin of the marijuana plant, both of which are pharmacologically active due to their interaction with cannabinoid receptors that are found throughout the body . CB1 receptors are found in both the central and peripheral nervous system, and are most abundant in the hippocampus and amygdala, which are the areas of the brain responsible for short-term memory storage and emotional regulation. A decrease in supine blood pressure, made worse by standing, was also observed initially. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance do not appear to develop to the appetite stimulant effect of dronabinol."
389,DB00471,"Montelukast is indicated for:    (a) the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma in adults and pediatric patients who are 12 months of age and older, although other regional health authorities specifically note this indication for adults and adolescents who are 15 years and older and also include indications for preventing day and night-time symptoms, and the treatment of acetylsalicylic acid-sensitive asthma;    (b) the prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) in patients who are 6 years of age and older, although other regional health authorities specifically note this indication for adults and adolescents who are 15 years and older; and    (c) the relief of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis in patients 2 years of age and older and perennial allergic rhinitis in patients 6 months of age and older, although other regional health authorities specifically note the relief of seasonal allergic rhinitis symptoms for adults and adolescents who are 15 years and older. For instance, montelukast and inhaled corticosteroids can be used concomitantly to demonstrate additive effects to control asthma or to decrease the necessary inhaled corticosteroid dose while still maintaining clinical stability. As a consequence, the agent can elicit substantial blockage of LTD4 leukotriene-mediated bronchoconstriction with doses as low as 5 mg. At the same time, in patients aged 15 years and older who were experiencing seasonal allergic rhinitis, the use of montelukast caused a median reduction of 13% in peripheral blood eosinophil counts when compared to placebo as well.Cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLT) like LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4, among others, are eicosanoids released by a variety of cells like mast cells and eosinophils. Alternatively, in allergic rhinitis, CysLTs are released by the nasal mucosa when exposed to allergens during both early and late phase reactions and participate in eliciting symptoms of allergic rhinitis like a congested nose and airway."
390,DB00472,"Fluoxetine is additionally indicated for the treatment of female patients with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).Fluoxetine is a 2nd generation antidepressant categorized as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). It gained FDA approval in 1987 and although it was initially intended for the treatment of depression, today it is commonly prescribed to manage depression in addition to various other pathologies.Fluoxetine blocks the serotonin reuptake transporter in the presynaptic terminal, which ultimately results in sustained levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in certain brain areas. The monoaminergic hypothesis of depression emerged in 1965 and linked depression with dysfunction of neurotransmitters such as noradrenaline and serotonin. As a result of this hypothesis, drugs that modulate levels of serotonin such as fluoxetine were developed. Fluoxetine interacts to a degree with the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor and it has been suggested that through this mechanism, it is able to increase noradrenaline and dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex."
391,DB00474,"Methohexital is indicated for use as an intravenous anaesthetic. It has also been commonly used to induce deep sedation.An intravenous anesthetic with a short duration of action that may be used for induction of anesthesia.Methohexital, a barbiturate, is used for the induction of anesthesia prior to the use of other general anesthetic agents and for induction of anesthesia for short surgical, diagnostic, or therapeutic procedures associated with minimal painful stimuli. Little analgesia is conferred by barbiturates; their use in the presence of pain may result in excitation.Methohexital binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl- ionopore at the GABAA receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl- ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged."
392,DB00475,"Chlordiazepoxide is indicated for the management of anxiety disorders or for the short-term relief of symptoms of anxiety, withdrawal symptoms of acute alcoholism, and preoperative apprehension and anxiety.An anxiolytic benzodiazepine derivative with anticonvulsant, sedative, and amnesic properties. The drug has been studied extensively in many species of animals and these studies are suggestive of action on the limbic system of the brain, which recent evidence indicates is involved in emotional responses. The taming effect of chlordiazepoxide was further demonstrated in rats made vicious by lesions in the septal area of the brain. The drug dosage which effectively blocked the vicious reaction was well below the dose which caused sedation in these animals.Chlordiazepoxide binds to stereospecific benzodiazepine (BZD) binding sites on GABA (A) receptor complexes at several sites within the central nervous system, including the limbic system and reticular formation. This results in an increased binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA to the GABA(A) receptor."
393,DB00476,"4) Management of fibromyalgia. It has since received approval for a variety of indications including the treatment of neuropathic pain, Generalized Anxiety disorder, osteoarthritis, and stress incontinence. It has also been shown to reduce the median incontinence episode frequency at doses of 40 and 80 mg.    Action at the dorsal horn of the spinal cord allows duloxetine to strengthen the the serotonergic and adrenergic pathways involved in descending inhibition of pain. Increased serotonin and norepinephrine concentrations in Onuf's nucleus leads to increased activation of 5-HT2, 5-HT3, and Î±1 adrenergic receptors. Dysfunctional serotonin and norepinephrine signaling are thought to be involved and increases in the availability of these neurotransmitters at the synaptic cleft thought to mediate a therapeutic effect."
394,DB00477,"For the treatment of schizophrenia; to control nausea and vomiting; for relief of restlessness and apprehension before surgery; for acute intermittent porphyria; as an adjunct in the treatment of tetanus; to control the manifestations of the manic type of manic-depressive illness; for relief of intractable hiccups; for the treatment of severe behavioral problems in children (1 to 12 years of age) marked by combativeness and/or explosive hyperexcitable behavior (out of proportion to immediate provocations), and in the short-term treatment of hyperactive children who show excessive motor activity with accompanying conduct disorders consisting of some or all of the following symptoms: impulsivity, difficulty sustaining attention, aggressivity, mood lability, and poor frustration tolerance.The prototypical phenothiazine antipsychotic drug. It also exerts sedative and antiemetic activity. Chlorpromazine has actions at all levels of the central nervous system-primarily at subcortical levels-as well as on multiple organ systems. Chlorpromazine has strong antiadrenergic and weaker peripheral anticholinergic activity; ganglionic blocking action is relatively slight. It also possesses slight antihistaminic and antiserotonin activity.Chlorpromazine acts as an antagonist (blocking agent) on different postsysnaptic receptors -on dopaminergic-receptors (subtypes D1, D2, D3 and D4 - different antipsychotic properties on productive and unproductive symptoms), on serotonergic-receptors (5-HT1 and 5-HT2, with anxiolytic, antidepressive and antiaggressive properties as well as an attenuation of extrapypramidal side-effects, but also leading to weight gain, fall in blood pressure, sedation and ejaculation difficulties), on histaminergic-receptors (H1-receptors, sedation, antiemesis, vertigo, fall in blood pressure and weight gain), alpha1/alpha2-receptors (antisympathomimetic properties, lowering of blood pressure, reflex tachycardia, vertigo, sedation, hypersalivation and incontinence as well as sexual dysfunction, but may also attenuate pseudoparkinsonism - controversial) and finally on muscarinic (cholinergic) M1/M2-receptors (causing anticholinergic symptoms like dry mouth, blurred vision, obstipation, difficulty/inability to urinate, sinus tachycardia, ECG-changes and loss of memory, but the anticholinergic action may attenuate extrapyramidal side-effects)."
395,DB00478,"For the prophylaxis and treatment of illness caused by various strains of influenza A virus in adults.An RNA synthesis inhibitor that is used as an antiviral agent in the prophylaxis and treatment of influenza.Rimantadine, a cyclic amine, is a synthetic antiviral drug and a derivate of adamantane, like a similar drug amantadine. Rimantadine is inhibitory to the in vitro replication of influenza A virus isolates from each of the three antigenic subtypes (H1N1, H2H2 and H3N2) that have been isolated from man. Rimantadine has little or no activity against influenza B virus. Rimantadine does not appear to interfere with the immunogenicity of inactivated influenza A vaccine.The mechanism of action of rimantadine is not fully understood. Rimantadine appears to exert its inhibitory effect early in the viral replicative cycle, possibly inhibiting the uncoating of the virus."
396,DB00479,"The use of amikacin in the treatment of staphylococcal infections should be restricted only to second-line therapy, and should be limited to only those patients suffering from severe infections caused by susceptible strains of staphylococcus species who have failed to show sensitivity to other available antibiotics. Bacteriologic studies should be performed to identify causative organisms and their susceptibilities to amikacin. Amikacin may be used as initial therapy in suspected gram-negative infections and therapy may be initiated before obtaining the results of susceptibility testing.Amikacin is a semi-synthetic aminoglycoside antibiotic that is derived from kanamycin A. Amikacin is synthesized by acylation with the l-(-)-Î³-amino-Î±-hydroxybutyryl side chain at the C-1 amino group of the deoxystreptamine moiety of kanamycin A.    Amikacin's unique property is that it exerts activity against more resistant gram-negative bacilli such as Acinetobacter baumanii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In September 2018, a liposomal inhalation suspension of this drug was approved by the FDA for the treatment of lung disease caused by Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) bacteria in a small population of patients with the disease who do not respond to traditional treatment.Amikacin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic. Amikacin, as well as the rest of the aminoglycosides, are generally bacteriocidal against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria."
397,DB00480,"Lenalidomide is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma (MM) in combination with dexamethasone. In combination with a rituximab product, lenalidomide is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously treated follicular lymphoma (FL) or previously treated marginal zone lymphoma (MZL).Lenalidomide (previously referred to as CC-5013) is an immunomodulatory drug with potent antineoplastic, anti-angiogenic, and anti-inflammatory properties. Lenalidomide also mediates indirect antitumour effects via its immunomodulatory actions: it inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are implicated in various hematologic malignancies. Lenalidomide enhances the host immunity by stimulating T cell proliferation and enhancing the activity of natural killer (NK) cells. Lenalidomide directly exerts antitumour effects by inhibiting the proliferation and inducing apoptosis of tumour cells."
398,DB00481,"Indicated for the reduction in the risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis or postmenopausal women with a high risk for invasive breast cancer.Raloxifene is a second generation selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that mediates anti-estrogenic effects on breast and uterine tissues, and estrogenic effects on bone, lipid metabolism, and blood coagulation. In a eight-week study evaluating short-term effects of raloxifene in healthy postmenopausal women, there was a decrease in the bone turnover markers, such as serum alkaline phosphatase level, serum osteocalcin level and urinary calcium excretion. Raloxifene was shown to inhibit estrogen-dependent proliferation of human breast cancer cells _in vitro_ and development of induced mammary tumors in rats _in vivo_. Study findings demonstrated that compared to placebo, the risk of invasive breast cancer was decreased by 76% among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that acts as both an estrogen agonist and antagonist via differential effects on the tissue-specific estrogen receptors."
399,DB00482,"It may be also be used to treat acute pain from various sources, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in children over 2, ankylosing spondylitis, and primary dysmenorrhea.Celecoxib, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) which is known for its decreased risk of causing gastrointestinal bleeding compared to other NSAIDS. , another member of the COX-2 inhibitor drug class, also known as Vioxx, was withdrawn from the market due to prothrombotic cardiovascular risks. Following an FDA Advisory Committee meeting in 2005, in which data from large clinical outcome trials were evaluated, the FDA concluded that the risk for cardiovascular thrombotic events for both COX-2 selective NSAIDs and nonselective NSAIDs was evident. It is not advisable to administer NSAIDS to these groups of patients. Celecoxib poses less of an ulceration risk than other NSAIDS, owing to its decreased effect on gastric mucosal prostaglandin synthesis when compared to placebo."
400,DB00483,"For use as adjuncts to anesthesia to induce skeletal muscle relaxation and to facilitate the management of patients undergoing mechanical ventilationA synthetic nondepolarizing blocking drug. The actions of gallamine triethiodide are similar to those of tubocurarine, but this agent blocks the cardiac vagus and may cause sinus tachycardia and, occasionally, hypertension and increased cardiac output. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1992, p198)Gallamine Triethiodide is a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drug (NDMRD) used as an adjunct to anesthesia to induce skeletal muscle relaxation. The actions of gallamine triethiodide are similar to those of tubocurarine, but this agent blocks the cardiac vagus and may cause sinus tachycardia and, occasionally, hypertension and increased cardiac output. Muscle groups differ in their sensitivity to these types of relaxants with ocular muscles (controlling eyelids) being most sensitive, followed by the muscles of the neck, jaw, limbs and then abdomen."
401,DB00484,"Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists are members of the ocular hypotensive agent drug class that are used in the chronic treatment of glaucoma. Brimonidine is the first topical treatment approved for facial erythema of rosacea.Brimonidine is a highly selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist that is 1000-fold more selective for the alpha2-adrenergic receptor than the alpha1-adrenergic receptor. In comparative studies consisting of patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, the ocular hypotensive effect of brimonidine was maintained during treatment periods of up to 1 year. It is proposed that initial dosing of the drug causes a reduction in aqueous humour production and chronic dosing leads to an increase in uveoscleral outflow. As brimonidine mediates a potent peripheral vasoconstrictive activity by selectively working on the alpha-2 adrenoceptors, the use of brimonidine is thought to be efficacious for the treatment of facial erythema of rosacea, which is thought to arise from vasomotor instability and abnormal vasodilation of the superficial cutaneous vasculature of the face."
402,DB00485,"Used to treat infections caused by penicillinase-producing staphylococci which have demonstrated susceptibility to the drug.One of the penicillins which is resistant to penicillinase.Dicloxacillin is a beta-lactamase resistant penicillin similar to oxacillin. Dicloxacillin has <i>in vitro</i> activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Dicloxacillin is stable against hydrolysis by a variety of beta-lactamases, including penicillinases, and cephalosporinases and extended spectrum beta-lactamases.Dicloxacillin exerts a bactericidal action against penicillin-susceptible microorganisms during the state of active multiplication. By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, dicloxacillin inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that dicloxacillin interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."
403,DB00486,"This restriction is required because a substantial proportion of any group of patients treated with Nabilone can be expected to experience disturbing psychotomimetic reactions not observed with other antiemetic agents.Nabilone (marketed as Cesamet) is a synthetic form of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Îï¿½?THC), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis (marijuana). Nabilone is approved by the FDA for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments . Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are the two most abundant cannabinoids found naturally in the resin of the marijuana plant, both of which are pharmacologically active due to their interaction with cannabinoid receptors that are found throughout the body . It was approved in 1985 by the United States FDA for treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting that has not responded to conventional antiemetics. It has been suggested that the antiemetic effect of nabilone is caused by interaction with the cannabinoid receptor system, i.e., the CB (1) receptor, which is a component of the endocannabinoid system of the body."
404,DB00487,"For the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in males and for gram-negative-bacterial infections in the gastrointestinal system and the genitourinary tract.A synthetic broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent active against most gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.Pefloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic. Flouroquinolones such as pefloxacin possess excellent activity against gram-negative aerobic bacteria such as E.coli and Neisseria gonorrhoea as well as gram-positive bacteria including S. pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. They also posses effective activity against shigella, salmonella, campylobacter, gonococcal organisms, and multi drug resistant pseudomonas and enterobacter.The bactericidal action of pefloxacin results from interference with the activity of the bacterial enzymes DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, which are needed for the transcription and replication of bacterial DNA. Topoisomerase IV appears to be the preferential target in gram-positive organisms. As a result DNA replication and transcription is inhibited."
405,DB00488,"For use as a single agent in the palliative treatment of patients with persistent or recurrent ovarian cancer following first-line therapy with a cisplatin and/or alkylating agent-based combination.An alkylating agent proposed as an antineoplastic. Altretamine has been demonstrated to be efficacious for certain ovarian tumors resistant to classical alkylating agents. Synthetic monohydroxymethylmelamines, and products of altretamine metabolism, in vitro and in vivo, can form covalent adducts with tissue macromolecules including DNA, but the relevance of these reactions to antitumor activity is unknown.The precise mechanism by which altretamine exerts its cytotoxic effect is unknown although it is classified as an alkylating anti-neoplastic agent. Through this mechanism, the drug is metabolized into alkylating agents by N-demethylation. These alkylating species consequently damage tumor cells."
406,DB00489,"There are also oral solutions and intravenous injections indicated for patients requiring sotalol, but for whom a tablet would not be appropriate.Sotalol is a methanesulfonanilide developed in 1960. D-sotalol does not have beta blocking activity but also reduces a patient's heart rate while standing or exercising. Beta blockers inhibit insulin secretion which may cause hyperglycemia in type II diabetes mellitus. Beta blockers decrease secretion of insulin, which may mask hypoglycemia in an insulin dependant patient. Further information regarding adverse reactions can be found here.Sotalol inhibits beta-1 adrenoceptors in the myocardium as well as rapid potassium channels to slow repolarization, lengthen the QT interval, and slow and shorten conduction of action potentials through the atria."
407,DB00490,"Buspirone was first approved in 1986 by the FDA  and has been used to treat anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and relieve symptoms of anxiety. The delayed onset of action of buspirone suggests that the therapeutic effectiveness in generalized anxiety may involved more than its molecular mechanism of action at the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors, or buspirone may induce adaptations of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors. Unlike benzodiazepines and barbiturates used in anxiety disorders, buspirone is not associated with a risk for developing physical dependence or withdrawal, or any significant interaction with central nervous system depressants such as ethanol. Buspirone acts as a full agonist at presynaptic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors, or 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> autoreceptors, expressed at dorsal raphe while acting as a partial agonist at the postsynaptic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors expressed on hippocampus and cortex. Buspirone also displays a weak affinity for serotonin 5HT2 receptors and acts as a weak antagonist on dopamine D2 autoreceptors, although there is not much evidence that the action at these receptors contribute to the anxiolytic effect of buspirone."
408,DB00491,"For use as an adjunct to diet to improve glycemic control in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) whose hyperglycemia cannot be managed with diet alone.Miglitol inhibits the breakdown complex carbohydrates into glucose. It is primarily used in diabetes mellitus type 2 for establishing greater glycemic control by preventing the digestion of carbohydrates (such as disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides) into monosaccharides which can be absorbed by the body. Because its mechanism of action is different, the effect of miglitol to enhance glycemic control is additive to that of sulfonylureas when used in combination. In addition, miglitol diminishes the insulinotropic and weight-increasing effects of sulfonylureas. In diabetic patients, this enzyme inhibition results in delayed glucose absorption and lowering of postprandial hyperglycemia."
409,DB00492,"Fosinoprilat is a competitive inhibitor of ACE, a peptidyl dipeptidase that is part of the RAAS. ATII increases blood pressure using a number of mechanisms. ACE inhibitors inhibit the rapid conversion of ATI to ATII and antagonize RAAS-induced increases in blood pressure. ACE (also known as kininase II) is also involved in the enzymatic deactivation of bradykinin, a vasodilator. Fosinoprilat, the active metabolite of fosinopril, competes with ATI for binding to ACE and inhibits and enzymatic proteolysis of ATI to ATII."
410,DB00493,"Also used before an operation to prevent infection after surgery.Cefotaxime is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic. Like other third-generation cephalosporins, it has broad spectrum activity against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. Cefotaxime sodium is marketed under various trade names including Claforan (Sanofi-Aventis).Cefotaxime is a third generation intravenous cephalosporin antibiotic. It has broad spectrum activity against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. A positive feature of cefotaxime is that it display a resistance to penicillinases and is useful to treat infections that are resistant to penicillin derivatives.The bactericidal activity of cefotaxime results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs)."
411,DB00494,"It is a member of the class of nitrocatechols. When administered concomittantly with levodopa and a decarboxylase inhibitor (e.g., carbidopa), increased and more sustained plasma levodopa concentrations are reached as compared to the administration of levodopa and a decarboxylase inhibitor.Entacapone is structurally and pharmacologically related to tolcapone, but unlike tolcapone, is not associated with hepatotoxicity. Entacapone selectively and reversiblly inhibits catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). In mammals, COMT is distributed throughout various organs with the highest activities in the liver and kidney. When entacapone is given in conjunction with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbidopa, plasma levels of levodopa are greater and more sustained than after administration of levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor alone."
412,DB00495,"Used in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of human immunovirus (HIV) infections.A dideoxynucleoside compound in which the 3&#39;-hydroxy group on the sugar moiety has been replaced by an azido group. The compound is a potent inhibitor of HIV replication, acting as a chain-terminator of viral DNA during reverse transcription. It improves immunologic function, partially reverses the HIV-induced neurological dysfunction, and improves certain other clinical abnormalities associated with AIDS. Zidovudine is phosphorylated to active metabolites that compete for incorporation into viral DNA. The lack of a 3'-OH group in the incorporated nucleoside analogue prevents the formation of the 5' to 3' phosphodiester linkage essential for DNA chain elongation, and therefore, the viral DNA growth is terminated.Zidovudine, a structural analog of thymidine, is a prodrug that must be phosphorylated to its active 5ï¿½?triphosphate metabolite, zidovudine triphosphate (ZDV-TP)."
413,DB00496,"For the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency and frequency.Darifenacin (EnablexÂ®, Novartis) is a medication used to treat urinary incontinence. Darifenacin blocks M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, which mediate bladder muscle contractions. <i>In vitro</i> studies using human recombinant muscarinic receptor subtypes show that darifenacin has greater affinity for the M3 receptor than for the other known muscarinic receptors (9 and 12-fold greater affinity for M3 compared to M1 and M5, respectively, and 59-fold greater affinity for M3 compared to both M2 and M4). Muscarinic receptors play an important role in several major cholinergically mediated functions, including contractions of the urinary bladder smooth muscle and stimulation of salivary secretion. Adverse drug effects such as dry mouth, constipation and abnormal vision may be mediated through effects on M3 receptors in these organs.Darifenacin selectively antagonizes the muscarinic M3 receptor."
414,DB00497,"Oxycodone is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. There is also an extended release formulation indicated for chronic moderate to severe pain requiring continuous opioid analgesics for an extended period.Oxycodone is a semisynthetic opioid analgesic derived from thebaine in Germany in 1917. These tissues include the respiratory centre in the brain stem, the cough centre in the medulla, muscles of the pupils, gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular system, endocrine system, and immune system. Oxycodone's effect on the respiratory centre is dose dependant respiratory depression. In the cardiovascular system histamine may be released leading to pruritis, red eyes, flushing, sweating, and decreased blood pressure."
415,DB00498,"For the treatment of pulmonary embolism, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation and flutter, cerebral embolism, mural thrombosis, and thrombophili. Also used for anticoagulant prophylaxis.An indandione that has been used as an anticoagulant. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p234)Phenindione thins the blood by antagonizing vitamin K which is required for the production of clotting factors in the liver. Phenindione has actions similar to warfarin, but it is now rarely employed because of its higer incidence of severe adverse effects.Phenindione inhibits vitamin K reductase, resulting in depletion of the reduced form of vitamin K (vitamin KH2). The synthesis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X and anticoagulant proteins C and S is inhibited."
416,DB00499,"For the management of locally confined Stage B2-C and Stage D2 metastatic carcinoma of the prostateAn antiandrogen with about the same potency as cyproterone in rodent and canine species.Flutamide is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen. In animal studies, flutamide demonstrates potent antiandrogenic effects. It exerts its antiandrogenic action by inhibiting androgen uptake and/or by inhibiting nuclear binding of androgen in target tissues or both. Elevations of plasma testosterone and estradiol levels have been noted following flutamide administration.Flutamide is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen that blocks the action of both endogenous and exogenous testosterone by binding to the androgen receptor. In addition Flutamide is a potent inhibitor of testosterone-stimulated prostatic DNA synthesis."
417,DB00500,"Also for treatment of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent (anti-inflammatory agents, NON-steroidal) similar in mode of action to indomethacin.Tolmetin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent. In patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, tolmetin is as effective as aspirin in controlling disease activity, with a similar incidence of adverse reactions. The mode of action of tolmetin is not known. However, studies in laboratory animals and man have demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory action of tolmetin is not due to pituitary-adrenal stimulation. This reduction in prostaglandin synthesis may be responsible for the anti-inflammatory action."
418,DB00501,"It is indicated for prophylaxis of recurrent gastric or duodenal ulcers, as adjunctive therapy in the management of cystic fibrosis in children, and to treat NSAID induced lesions and gastrointestinal symptoms.A histamine congener, it competitively inhibits histamine binding to histamine H2 receptors. Cimetidine has a range of pharmacological actions. It inhibits gastric acid secretion, as well as pepsin and gastrins output. It also blocks the activity of cytochrome P-450 which might explain proposals for use in neoadjuvant therapy.Cimetidine is a histamine H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonist. It reduces basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion and a reduction in gastric volume, acidity, and amount of gastric acid released in response to stimuli including food, caffeine, insulin, betazole, or pentagastrin."
419,DB00502,"While haloperidol has demonstrated pharmacologic activity at a number of receptors in the brain, it exerts its antipsychotic effect through its strong antagonism of the dopamine receptor (mainly D2), particularly within the mesolimbic and mesocortical systems of the brain. Dopamine-antagonizing medications such as haloperidol are though to improve psychotic symptoms and states that are caused by an over-production of dopamine, such as schizophrenia, which is theorized to be caused by a hyperdopaminergic state within the limbic system of the brain. Traditional antipsychotics, such as haloperidol, bind more tightly than dopamine itself to the dopamine D2 receptor, with dissociation constants that are lower than that for dopamine. Due to the risk of unpleasant and sometimes lifelong extrapyramidal symptoms, newer antipsychotic medications than haloperidol have been discovered and formulated. This is also consistent with the theory of a lower affinity for D2 receptors for these drugs."
420,DB00503,"It is now more commonly used as a booster of other protease inhibitors and is available in both liquid formulations and as capsules. Ritonavir is a potent CYP3A inhibitor that increases peak and trough plasma drug concentrations of other protease inhibitors such as  and overall drug exposure. Ritonavir is combined with other drugs to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients at risk for progressing into a severe form of the disease, such as .Ritonavir is a protease inhibitor with activity against Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1). Ritonavir binds to the protease active site and inhibits the activity of the enzyme. Ritonavic inhibits the HIV viral proteinase enzyme that normally cleaves the structural and replicative proteins that arise from major HIV genes, such as *gag* and *pol*."
421,DB00504,"For the complete or partial reversal of narcotic depression, including respiratory depression, induced by opioids.An opioid antagonist with properties similar to those of naloxone; in addition it also possesses some agonist properties. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p683)Levallorphan, an opioid antagonist similar to naloxone, is used to treat drug overdoses. It is used especially in the treatment of respiratory depression due to narcotic overdoses. Levallorphan prevents or reverses the effects of opioids including respiratory depression, sedation and hypotension. Also, it can reverse the psychotomimetic and dysphoric effects of agonist-antagonists such as pentazocine.Levallorphan antagonizes opioid effects by competing for the same receptor sites."
422,DB00508,"Also used to control nausea and vomiting.A phenothiazine used as an antipsychotic agent and as an antiemetic.Triflupromazine is a member of a class of drugs called phenthiazines, which are dopamine D1/D2 receptor antagonists. Phenothiazines are used to treat serious mental and emotional disorders, including schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. It reduces anxiety, emotional withdrawal, hallucinations, disorganized thoughts, blunted mood, and suspiciousness. Triflupromazine is used particularly to control violent behavior during acute episodes of psychotic disorders. The mechanism of the anti-emetic effect is due predominantly to blockage of the dopamine D2 neurotransmitter receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) and vomiting centre."
423,DB00511,"Used for fast digitalization in congestive heart failure.Cardioactive derivative of lanatoside A or of digitoxin used for fast digitalization in congestive heart failure.The main pharmacological effects of acetyldigitoxin are on the heart. Its main cardiac effects are 1) a decrease of conduction of electrical impulses through the AV node, making it a commonly used drug in controlling the heart rate during atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, and 2) an increase of force of contraction via inhibition of the Na+/K+ ATPase pump.Acetyldigitoxin binds to a site on the extracellular aspect of the &alpha;-subunit of the Na+/K+ATPase pump in the membranes of heart cells (myocytes). Increased amounts of Ca2+ are then stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and released by each action potential, which is unchanged by acetyldigitoxin. This is a different mechanism from that of catecholamines. This is important for its clinical use in different arrhythmias."
424,DB00512,"Administered orally, vancomycin is indicated in adult and pediatric patients for the treatment of _Clostridium difficile_-associated diarrhea and for enterocolitis caused by _Staphylococcus aureus_ (including methicillin-resistant strains).Antibacterial obtained from Streptomyces orientalis. It is a glycopeptide related to ristocetin that inhibits bacterial cell wall assembly and is toxic to kidneys and the inner ear. As of January 29 2018, CutisPharma's Firvanq is the only FDA approved vancomycin oral liquid treatment option available for the the treatment of _Clostridium difficile_ associated diarrhea and enterocolitis caused by _Staphylococcus aureus_, including methicillin-resistant strains . Vancomycin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections: <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>, <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i>, <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> (including penicillin-resistant strains), <i>Streptococcus agalactiae</i>, <i>Actinomyces</i> species, and <i>Lactobacillus</i> species. The combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside acts synergistically in vitro against many strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus bovis, enterococci, and the viridans group streptococci .The bactericidal action of vancomycin results primarily from inhibition of cell-wall biosynthesis."
425,DB00513,"For use in the treatment of excessive postoperative bleeding.An antifibrinolytic agent that acts by inhibiting plasminogen activators which have fibrinolytic properties.Aminocaproic acid works as an antifibrinolytic. Aminocaproic acid may be a possible prophylactic for vascular disease, as it may prevent formation of lipoprotein (a), a risk factor for vascular disease. Aminocaproic acid binds reversibly to the kringle domain of plasminogen and blocks the binding of plasminogen to fibrin and its activation to plasmin. With NO activation of plasmin, there is a reduction in fibrinolysis. This consequently will reduce the amount of bleeding post surgery."
426,DB00514,"Dextromethorphan in combination with  is indicated in the treatment of pseudobulbar affect.Dextromethorphan is a levorphanol derivative and codeine analog commonly used as a cough suppressant and also a drug of abuse. It has a moderate therapeutic window, as intoxication can occur at higher doses. Dextromethorphan has a moderate duration of action. It is also an antagonist of Î±3/Î²4 nicotinic receptors. However, the mechanism by which dextromethorphan's receptor agonism and antagonism translates to a clinical effect is not well understood."
427,DB00515,"For the treatment of metastatic testicular tumors, metastatic ovarian tumors and advanced bladder cancer.Cisplatin, cisplatinum or cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (CDDP) is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug used to treat various types of cancers, including sarcomas, some carcinomas (e.g. small cell lung cancer, and ovarian cancer), lymphomas and germ cell tumors. It was the first member of its class, which now also includes carboplatin and oxaliplatin.Cisplatin is an antineoplastic in the class of alkylating agents and is used to treat various forms of cancer. Alkylating agents are so named because of their ability to add alkyl groups to many electronegative groups under conditions present in cells. This makes the strands unable to uncoil and separate. Alkylating agents work by three different mechanisms all of which achieve the same end result - disruption of DNA function and cell death.Alkylating agents work by three different mechanisms: 1) attachment of alkyl groups to DNA bases, resulting in the DNA being fragmented by repair enzymes in their attempts to replace the alkylated bases, preventing DNA synthesis and RNA transcription from the affected DNA, 2) DNA damage via the formation of cross-links (bonds between atoms in the DNA) which prevents DNA from being separated for synthesis or transcription, and 3) the induction of mispairing of the nucleotides leading to mutations."
428,DB00516,"Used to prevent or reduce the severity of allergic contact dermatitis due to urushiol, the allergenic resin of poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac.Bentoquatam is a topical medication intended to act as a shield against exposure to the irritating substance urushiol, found in plants such as poison ivy or poison oak. Bentoquatam contains bentonite, a clay, and is only effective as long as the film is visible on the skin.Bentoquatam protects the skin like a shield against poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac by physically blocking skin contact with their resin. The best protection against getting these conditions is to avoid contact with these plants. This medicine does not dry oozing and weeping caused by the rash of poison ivy, poison oak, or poison sumac.The mechanism of action is unknown. It is thought topically applied bentoquatam acts as a physical barrier that interferes with the adsorption of antigens onto the skin and reduces absorption of antigens into the skin."
429,DB00517,"For use in conjunction with antacids or histamine H2-receptor antagonists in the treatment of peptic ulcer, to reduce further gastric acid secretion and delay gastric emptying.Anisotropine methylbromide is a quaternary ammonium compound. Depending on the dose, anisotropine methylbromide may reduce the motility and secretory activity of the gastrointestinal system, and the tone of the ureter and urinary bladder and may have a slight relaxant action on the bile ducts and gallbladder. In general, smaller doses of anisotropine methylbromide inhibit salivary and bronchial secretions, sweating, and accommodation; cause dilatation of the pupil; and increase the heart rate. Larger doses are required to decrease motility of the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts and to inhibit gastric acid secretion.Anisotropine methylbromide is a quaternary ammonium compound. Depending on the dose, anisotropine methylbromide may reduce the motility and secretory activity of the gastrointestinal system, and the tone of the ureter and urinary bladder and may have a slight relaxant action on the bile ducts and gallbladder."
430,DB00518,"For the treatment of parenchymal neurocysticercosis due to active lesions caused by larval forms of the pork tapeworm, <i>Taenia solium</i> and for the treatment of cystic hydatid disease of the liver, lung, and peritoneum, caused by the larval form of the dog tapeworm, <i>Echinococcus granulosus</i>.A benzimidazole broad-spectrum anthelmintic structurally related to mebendazole that is effective against many diseases. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p38)Albendazole is a broad-spectrum anthelmintic. The principal mode of action for albendazole is by its inhibitory effect on tubulin polymerization which results in the loss of cytoplasmic microtubules.Albendazole causes degenerative alterations in the tegument and intestinal cells of the worm by diminishing its energy production, ultimately leading to immobilization and death of the parasite. It works by binding to the colchicine-sensitive site of tubulin, thus inhibiting its polymerization or assembly into microtubules. As cytoplasmic microtubules are critical in promoting glucose uptake in larval and adult stages of the susceptible parasites, the glycogen stores of the parasites are depleted."
431,DB00519,"Trandolapril may be used to treat mild to moderate hypertension, to improve survival following myocardial infarction in clinically stable patients with left ventricular dysfunction, as an adjunct treatment for congestive heart failure, and to slow the rate of progression of renal disease in hypertensive individuals with diabetes mellitus and microalbuminuria or overt nephropathy.Trandolapril is the ethyl ester prodrug of a nonsulfhydryl ACE inhibitor, trandolaprilat. Trandolapril is deesterified in the liver to the diacid metabolite, trandolaprilat, which is approximately eight times more active as an inhibitor of ACE than its parent compound. ATII increases blood pressure via a number of mechanisms. ACE inhibitors inhibit the rapid conversion of ATI to ATII and antagonize RAAS-induced increases in blood pressure. Trandolaprilat, the active metabolite of trandolapril, competes with ATI for binding to ACE and inhibits and enzymatic proteolysis of ATI to ATII."
432,DB00520,"It is typically administered intravenously. It shows activity against infections with Aspergillus and Candida, and works by inhibiting Î²(1,3)-D-Glucan of the fungal cell wall.Caspofungin is an antifungal drug, and belongs to a new class termed the echinocandins. Antifungals in the echinocandin class inhibit the synthesis of glucan in the cell wall, probably via the enzyme 1,3-beta glucan synthase. beta-(1,3)-D-glucan is not present in mammalian cells. The primary target is beta-(1,3)-glucan synthase."
433,DB00521,"For the treatment of intraocular hypertension and chronic open-angle glaucomaA beta-adrenergic antagonist used as an anti-arrhythmia agent, an anti-angina agent, an antihypertensive agent, and an antiglaucoma agent.Carteolol is a beta1 and beta2 (non-selective) adrenergic receptor-blocking agent that does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct myocardial depressant, or local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) activity. Carteolol, when applied topically to the eye, has the action of reducing elevated, as well as normal, intraocular pressure, whether or not accompanied by glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of glaucomatous visual field loss and optic nerve damage. Carteolol reduces intraocular pressure with little or no effect on pupil size or accommodation in contrast to the miosis which cholinergic agents are known to produce.The primary mechanism of the ocular hypotensive action of carteolol in reducing intraocular pressure is most likely a decrease in aqueous humor production. This process is initiated by the non-selective beta1 and beta2 adrenergic receptor blockade."
434,DB00523,"An excess of tretinoin can be teratogenic. It is used in the treatment of psoriasis; acne vulgaris; and several other skin diseases. It has also been approved for use in promyelocytic leukemia (leukemia, promyelocytic, acute).Alitretinoin (9-<i>cis</i>-retinoic acid) is a naturally-occurring endogenous retinoid indicated for topical treatment of cutaneous lesions in patients with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. Alitretinoin inhibits the growth of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) cells <i>in vitro</i>.Alitretinoin binds to and activates all known intracellular retinoid receptor subtypes (RARa, RARb, RARg, RXRa, RXRb and RXRg). Once activated these receptors function as transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes that control the process of cellular differentiation and proliferation in both normal and neoplastic cells."
435,DB00524,A proximal action of metolazone has been shown in humans by increased excretion of phosphate and magnesium ions and by a markedly increased fractional excretion of sodium in patients with severely compromised glomerular filtration. Sodium and chloride ions are excreted in approximately equivalent amounts. The increased delivery of sodium to the distal tubular exchange site results in increased potassium excretion. Metolazone does not inhibit carbonic anhydrase. The antihypertensive mechanism of action of metolazone is not fully understood but is presumed to be related to its saluretic and diuretic properties.
436,DB00526,"However, this leads to poorer water solubility, which was compensated by the addition of the chloride moieties. Due to this chemical moiety, oxaliplatin readily undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, thus complicating oxaliplatin's pharmacokinetics. Like most platinum-based compounds, oxaliplatin's mechanism of action is primarily through DNA damage through DNA crosslinking, particularly intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking. However, due to the structure of oxaliplatin, its adducts make the binding of mismatch repair protein to DNA harder compared to cisplatin or carboplatin's adducts, resulting in greater cytotoxic effects. The DACH moiety also prevents cross-resistance with cisplatin and carboplatin.Ongoing trials have also shown promising results for oxaliplatin use in nonHodgkinâs lymphoma, breast cancer, mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer."
437,DB00527,"For production of local or regional anesthesia by infiltration techniques such as percutaneous injection and intravenous regional anesthesia by peripheral nerve block techniques such as brachial plexus and intercostal and by central neural techniques such as lumbar and caudal epidural blocks.A local anesthetic of the amide type now generally used for surface anesthesia. It is one of the most potent and toxic of the long-acting local anesthetics and its parenteral use is restricted to spinal anesthesia. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p1006)Dibucaine is an amide-type local anesthetic, similar to lidocaine.Local anesthetics block both the initiation and conduction of nerve impulses by decreasing the neuronal membrane's permeability to sodium ions through sodium channel inhibition. This reversibly stabilizes the membrane and inhibits depolarization, resulting in the failure of a propagated action potential and subsequent conduction blockade."
438,DB00528,"For the treatment of Hypertension, management of angina pectoris and Raynaud's syndromeLercanidipine is a calcium channel blocker of the dihydropyridine class. It is sold under various commercial names including Zanidip.Lercanidipine, a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker, is used alone or with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, to treat hypertension, chronic stable angina pectoris, and Prinzmetal's variant angina. Lercanidipine is similar to other peripheral vasodilators. Lercanidipine inhibits the influx of extra cellular calcium across the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes possibly by deforming the channel, inhibiting ion-control gating mechanisms, and/or interfering with the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The decrease in intracellular calcium inhibits the contractile processes of the myocardial smooth muscle cells, causing dilation of the coronary and systemic arteries, increased oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue, decreased total peripheral resistance, decreased systemic blood pressure, and decreased afterload.By deforming the channel, inhibiting ion-control gating mechanisms, and/or interfering with the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, Lercanidipine inhibits the influx of extracellular calcium across the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes The decrease in intracellular calcium inhibits the contractile processes of the myocardial smooth muscle cells, causing dilation of the coronary and systemic arteries, increased oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue, decreased total peripheral resistance, decreased systemic blood pressure, and decreased afterload."
439,DB00529,"For the treatment of CMV retinitis in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and for treatment of acyclovir-resistant mucocutaneous HSV infections in immunocompromised patients.An antiviral agent used in the treatment of cytomegalovirus retinitis. Foscarnet also shows activity against human herpes viruses and HIV.Foscarnet is an organic analogue of inorganic pyrophosphate that inhibits replication of herpes viruses <i>in vitro</i> including cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2). Foscarnet does not require activation (phosphorylation) by thymidine kinase or other kinases and therefore is active in vitro against HSV TK deficient mutants and CMV UL97 mutants. Thus, HSV strains resistant to acyclovir or CMV strains resistant to ganciclovir may be sensitive to foscarnet. However, acyclovir or ganciclovir resistant mutants with alterations in the viral DNA polymerase may be resistant to foscarnet and may not respond to therapy with foscarnet."

Erlotinib is an inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase that is used in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer and several other types of cancer. It is typically marketed under the trade name Tarceva. Erlotinib binds to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase in a reversible fashion at the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site of the receptor. This finding introduces the potential use of erlotinib in the treatment of JAK2V617F-positive PV and other myeloproliferative disorders.The mechanism of clinical antitumor action of erlotinib is not fully characterized."

These are heterocyclic aromatic compounds containing an imiazolidinedione moiety substituted by a phenyl group. Mephenytoin is known to target sodium channel protein type 5 subunit alpha. Mephenytoin is a hydantoin-derivative anticonvulsant used to control various partial seizures. This includes the reduction of posttetanic potentiation at synapses.
443,DB00533,"The proteins that rofecoxib target include elastin and prostaglandin G/H synthase 2. NSAIDs appear to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis via the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX), which are responsible for catalyzing the formation of prostaglandins in the arachidonic acid pathyway. Although the exact mechanisms have not been clearly established, NSAIDs exert their anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic primarily through the inhibition of COX-2. As rofecoxib is selective for COX-2, it may be potentially associated with a decreased risk of certain adverse events, but more data is needed to fully evaulate the drug.The anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic effects of NSAIDs appear to result from the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. Although the exact mechanism of action has not been determined, these effects appear to be mediated through the inhibition of the COX-2 isoenzyme at the sites of inflammation with subsequent reduction in the synthesis of certain prostaglandins from their arachidonic acid precursors."
444,DB00535,"Various beta-lactamase producing organisms may be treated, as indicated in certain sections below. Because of its chemical structure, it is effective against organisms that are resistant to first-line cephalosporin therapy due to the production of beta-lactamase enzymes.Cefdinir is a bactericidal agent that treats bacterial infections by interfering with cell wall synthesis. As a result, many organisms that are resistant to other cephalosporins may be susceptible to cefdinir.Five-member thiazolidine rings that make up penicillins are replaced in cephalosporins by a six-member dihydrothiazine ring, conferring greater bactericidal activity. With a mechanism similar to other beta-lactam antibiotics, the bactericidal activity of cefdinir is caused by the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). It has also been shown to inhibit transpeptidase enzymes of various bacteria, which may play a role in its bactericidal action."

Toremifene is a nonsteroidal agent that has demonstrated potent antiestrogenic properties in animal test systems. The antiestrogenic effects may be related to its ability to compete with estrogen for binding sites in target tissues such as breast. In this rat model, Toremifene appears to exert its antitumor effects by binding the estrogen receptors. In cytosols derived from human breast adenocarcinomas, Toremifene competes with estradiol for estrogen receptor protein.Toremifene is a nonsteroidal triphenylethylene derivative."
448,DB00540,"Nortriptyline is indicated for the relief of the symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD). It is used in the treatment of major depression and is also used off-label for chronic pain and other conditions.Nortriptyline exerts antidepressant effects likely by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine at neuronal cell membranes. It displays a more selective reuptake inhibition for noradrenaline, which may explain increased symptom improvement after nortriptyline therapy. Tricyclic antidepressants do not inhibit monoamine oxidase nor do they affect dopamine reuptake. As with other tricyclics, nortriptyline displays affinity for other receptors including mACh receptors, histamine receptors, 5-HT receptors, in addition to other receptors."

450,DB00542,"Benazepril, brand name Lotensin, is a medication used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension), congestive heart failure, and chronic renal failure. Upon cleavage of its ester group by the liver, benazepril is converted into its active form benazeprilat, a non-sulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.Benazepril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, is a prodrug which, when hydrolyzed by esterases to its active Benazeprilat, is used to treat hypertension and heart failure, to reduce proteinuria and renal disease in patients with nephropathies, and to prevent stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiac death in high-risk patients. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex.Benazeprilat, the active metabolite of Benazepril, competes with angiotensin I for binding at the angiotensin-converting enzyme, blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II. As angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor and a negative-feedback mediator for renin activity, lower concentrations result in a decrease in blood pressure and stimulation of baroreceptor reflex mechanisms, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion."
451,DB00543,"In non-depressed individuals, amoxapine does not affect mood or arousal, but may cause sedation. TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. The antidepressant effects of TCAs are thought to be due to an overall increase in serotonergic neurotransmission. Amoxapine may be used to treat neurotic and reactive depressive disorders, endogenous and psychotic depression, and mixed symptoms of depression and anxiety or agitation.Amoxapine is a tricyclic antidepressant of the dibenzoxazepine class, chemically distinct from the dibenzodiazepines, dibenzocycloheptenes, and dibenzoxepines. The mechanism of its clinical action in man is not well understood."

455,DB00548,"It works in part by stopping the growth of skin bacteria that cause acne, and by keeping skin pores clear. Azelaic acid's antimicrobial action may be attributable to inhibition of microbial cellular protein synthesis.Azelaic acid is a saturated dicarboxylic acid found naturally in wheat, rye, and barley. It is effective against a number of skin conditions, such as mild to moderate acne, when applied topically in a cream formulation of 20%. It is thought that azelaic acid manifests its antibacterial effects by inhibiting the synthesis of cellular protein in anaerobic and aerobic bacteria, especially <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis</i> and <i>Propionibacterium acnes</i>. Azelaic acid may be effective against both inflamed and noninflamed lesions."
456,DB00549,"It is available as a tablet and is usually dosed twice daily. Another leukotriene receptor antagonist is montelukast (Singulair), which is usually taken just once daily. Zafirlukast blocks the action of the cysteinyl leukotrienes on the CysLT1 receptors, thus reducing constriction of the airways, build-up of mucus in the lungs and inflammation of the breathing passages.Zafirlukast is a synthetic, selective peptide leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) indicated for the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma. Zafirlukast prevented intradermal LTD4-induced increases in cutaneous vascular permeability and inhibited inhaled LTD4-induced influx of eosinophils into animal lungs.Zafirlukast is a selective and competitive receptor antagonist of leukotriene D4 and E4 (LTD4 and LTE4), components of slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRSA). Cysteinyl leukotriene production and receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma, including airway edema, smooth muscle constriction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma."
457,DB00550,Used to manage hyperthyroidism which is due to an overactive thyroid gland (Grave's disease).A thiourea antithyroid agent. Propythiouracil inhibits the synthesis of thyroxine and inhibits the peripheral conversion of throxine to tri-iodothyronine. PTU inhibits iodine and peroxidase from their normal interactions with thyroglobulin to form T4 and T3. The actions and use of propylthiouracil are similar to those of methimazole.Propylthiouracil binds to thyroid peroxidase and thereby inhibits the conversion of iodide to iodine. Therefore propylthiouracil effectively inhibits the production of new thyroid hormones.
458,DB00551,"Used, in addition to antibiotics or medical procedures, to treat chronic urea-splitting urinary infections.Acetohydroxamic Acid, a synthetic drug derived from hydroxylamine and ethyl acetate, is similar in structure to urea. It is used, in addition to antibiotics or medical procedures, to treat chronic urea-splitting urinary infections.Acetohydroxamic Acid, a synthetic drug derived from hydroxylamine and ethyl acetate, is similar in structure to urea. Acetohydroxamic Acid has no direct antimicrobial action and does not acidify urine directly.Acetohydroxamic Acid reversibly inhibits the bacterial enzyme urease. This inhibits the hydrolysis of urea and production of ammonia in urine infected with urea-splitting organisms, leading to a decrease in pH and ammonia levels. As antimicrobial agents are more effective in such conditions, the effectiveness of these agents is amplified, resulting in a higher cure rate."
459,DB00552,"The drug is effective in the treatment of many lymphoproliferative malignancies, particularly hairy-cell leukemia. Intracellular activation results in incorporation into DNA as a false purine base. Cytotoxicity is cell cycle phase-specific (S-phase).Pentostatin is a potent transition state inhibitor of adenosine deaminase (ADA), the greatest activity of which is found in cells of the lymphoid system.

It is a photoactive substance that forms DNA adducts in the presence of ultraviolet A irradiation.Methoxsalen selectively inhibits the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The guanine and cytosine content correlates with the degree of Methoxsalen-induced cross-linking. At high concentrations of the drug, cellular RNA and protein synthesis are also suppressed.After activation it binds preferentially to the guanine and cytosine moieties of DNA, leading to cross-linking of DNA, thus inhibiting DNA synthesis and function."
461,DB00554,"For treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.A cyclooxygenase inhibiting, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAID) that is well established in treating rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis and used for musculoskeletal disorders, dysmenorrhea, and postoperative pain. Its long half-life enables it to be administered once daily.Piroxicam is in a class of drugs called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Piroxicam works by reducing hormones that cause inflammation and pain in the body. Piroxicam is used to reduce the pain, inflammation, and stiffness caused by rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.The antiinflammatory effect of Piroxicam may result from the reversible inhibition of cyclooxygenase, causing the peripheral inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. The prostaglandins are produced by an enzyme called Cox-1."
462,DB00555,"It is also indicated for the process of conversion to drug monotherapy for those at least 16 years of age or older with partial seizures and currently are receiving treatment with carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or valproate as the single antiepileptic drug (AED). In addition to the above, lamotrigine is also indicated for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder, delaying the time to mood episodes (which may include mania, hypomania, depression, mixed episodes) in adults at least 18 years or older, who have been treated for acute mood symptoms with standard therapy. Limitations of use    It is important to note that lamotirigine should not be used in the treatment of acute mood episodes, as efficacy has not been established in this context.Lamotrigine is an antiepileptic drug belonging in the phenyltriazine class. While it is indicated for epilepsy and bipolar disorders, there is evidence that lamotrigine could have some clinical efficacy in certain neuropathic pain states.Lamotrigine likely prevents seizures and prevents mood symptoms via stabilizing presynaptic neuronal membranes and preventing the release of excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate, which contribute to seizure activity. Although this harmful metabolite is only found in trace amounts in humans, plasma concentrations may increase in conditions that cause decreased drug glucuronidation, such as liver disease.The exact mechanism of action of lamotrigine is not fully elucidated, as it may exert cellular activities that contribute to its efficacy in a range of conditions."
463,DB00556,"When exposed to ultrasound waves, the microspheres resonate and ""echo"" strong signals back to the ultrasound machine. The difference in density between the gas-filled bubbles and the blood around them creates an increased level of contrast visible in the resulting ultrasound image. During echocardiography, activated Perflutren enhances images of the inner edges or borders of the heart, producing an improved image that may enable physicians to better diagnose patients.Perflutren, a diagnostic drug that is intended to be used for contrast enhancement during the indicated echocardiographic procedures, comprised of lipid-coated microspheres filled with octafluoropropane(OFP) gas. The perflutren lipid microspheres exhibit lower acoustic impedance than blood and enhance the intrinsic backscatter of blood.Perflutren is comprised of gas-filled microspheres that are injected or infused into the body. When exposed to ultrasound waves, the microspheres resonate and ""echo"" strong signals back to the ultrasound machine."
464,DB00557,"It is also indicated in the treatment of histamine-mediated pruritus and pruritus due to allergic conditions such as chronic urticaria. Activity at off-targets also allows for its use as a sedative anxiolytic and an antiemetic in certain disease states. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes. Inverse agonism at these receptors is responsible for hydroxyzine's efficacy in the treatment of histaminic edema, flare, and pruritus. Hydroxyzine is not a cortical depressant, so its sedative properties likely occur at the subcortical level of the CNS."
465,DB00558,"For the prevention and treatment of influenza A and B.A guanido-neuraminic acid that is used to inhibit neuraminidase.Zanamivir, an antiviral agent, is a neuraminidase inhibitor indicated for treatment of uncomplicated acute illness due to influenza A and B virus in adults and pediatric patients 7 years and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 2 days. Zanamivir has also been shown to significantly inhibit the human sialidases NEU3 and NEU2 in the micromolar range (Ki 3.7 +/-0.48 and 12.9+/-0.07 microM, respectively), which could account for some of the rare side effects of zanamivir.The proposed mechanism of action of zanamivir is via inhibition of influenza virus neuraminidase with the possibility of alteration of virus particle aggregation and release. By binding and inhibiting the neuraminidase protein, the drug renders the influenza virus unable to escape its host cell and infect others."
466,DB00559,"Used in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), to improve exercise ability and to decrease the rate of clinical worsening (in patients with WHO Class III or IV symptoms).Bosentan is a dual endothelin receptor antagonist marketed under the trade name Tracleer by Actelion Pharmaceuticals. Patients with PAH have elevated levels of endothelin, a potent blood vessel constrictor, in their plasma and lung tissue. Bosentan blocks the binding of endothelin to its receptors, thereby negating endothelin's deleterious effects.Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a neurohormone, the effects of which are mediated by binding to ETA and ETB receptors in the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle. ET-1 concentrations are elevated in plasma and lung tissue of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, suggesting a pathogenic role for ET-1 in this disease. Bosentan is a specific and competitive antagonist at endothelin receptor types ETA and ETB."

(From Martindale, The Extra Pharmocopoeia, 30th ed, p1225)Doxapram is an analeptic agent (a stimulant of the central nervous system). The respiratory stimulant action is manifested by an increase in tidal volume associated with a slight increase in respiratory rate. A pressor response may result following doxapram administration. The pressor response is due to the improved cardiac output rather than peripheral vasoconstriction."
469,DB00562,"For the treatment of high blood pressure and management of edema.Benzthiazide is used to treat hypertension and edema. Thiazides also cause loss of potassium and an increase in serum uric acid. Thiazides cause vasodilation by activating calcium-activated potassium channels (large conductance) in vascular smooth muscles and inhibiting various carbonic anhydrases in vascular tissue.Benzthiazide is used to treat hypertension and edema. Thiazides also cause loss of potassium and an increase in serum uric acid. Thiazides cause vasodilation by activating calcium-activated potassium channels (large conductance) in vascular smooth muscles and inhibiting various carbonic anhydrases in vascular tissue.As a diuretic, benzthiazide inhibits active chloride reabsorption at the early distal tubule via the Na-Cl cotransporter, resulting in an increase in the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water."
470,DB00563,"Methotrexate injections for subcutaneous use are indicated for severe active rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and severe, recalcitrant, disabling psoriasis. This inhibition leads to suppression of inflammation as well as prevention of cell division. Because of these effects, methotrexate is often used to treat inflammation caused by arthritis or to control cell division in neoplastic diseases such as breast cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Methotrexate was granted FDA approval on 7 December 1953.Methotrexate inhibits enzymes responsible for nucleotide synthesis which prevents cell division and leads to anti-inflammatory actions. It has a long duration of action and is generally given to patients once weekly."
471,DB00564,"Carbamazepine is also indicated for the treatment of manic episodes and mixed manic-depressive episodes caused by bipolar I disorder. Some off-label, unapproved uses of carbamazepine include the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome and restless leg syndrome.Carbamazepine, also known as Tegretol, is an anticonvulsant drug and analgesic drug used to control seizures and to treat pain resulting from trigeminal neuralgia. It was initially approved by the FDA in 1965. **General effects**    Carbamazepine treats seizures and the symptoms of trigeminal neuralgia by inhibiting sodium channels. A potential therapeutic target to combat carbamazepine resistance has recently been identified as the EPHX1 gene promoter, potentially conferring resistance to carbamazepine through methylation."
472,DB00565,"Cisatracurium is indicated as an adjunct to general anesthesia to facilitate tracheal intubation in adults and pediatric patients 1 month to 12 years of age. Cisatracurium has an intermediate duration of action and is one of the most commonly used neuromuscular blocking agents in intensive care.. Cisatracurium acts on cholinergic receptors, blocking neuromuscular transmission. This action is antagonized by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as neostigmine. The degree and duration of the neuromuscular block produced by cisatracurium increases in a dose-dependent manner, while the time to maximum neuromuscular block decreases. Medication errors increase the risk of death, and the use of certain drugs may potentiate the neuromuscular blocking action of cisatracurium.Like other non-depolarising neuromuscular blocking agents, cisatracurium binds competitively to cholinergic receptors in motor end-plate neurons, blocking acetylcholine from accessing the receptors."
473,DB00566,"For the treatment of lead poisoning in pediatric patients with blood lead levels above 45 &micro;g/dL. May also be used to treat mercury or arsenic poisoning.A mercaptodicarboxylic acid used as an antidote to heavy metal poisoning because it forms strong chelates with them.Succimer is an orally active, heavy metal chelating agent. It forms water soluble chelates and, consequently, increases the urinary excretion of lead. Succimer is not to be used for prophylaxis of lead poisoning in a lead-containing environment. It binds with high specificity to ions of lead in the blood to form a water-soluble complex that is subsequently excreted by the kidneys."
474,DB00567,"Cephalexin is indicated for the treatment of certain infections caused by susceptible bacteria. These infections include respiratory tract infections, otitis media, skin and skin structure infections, bone infections, and genitourinary tract infections.Cephalexin is the first of the first generation cephalosporins. This antibiotic contains a  beta lactam and a dihydrothiazide. Cephalexin is used to treat a number of susceptible bacterial infections through inhibition of cell wall synthesis. It is effective against most gram-positive bacteria through its inihibition of the cross linking reaction between N-acetyl muramicacid and N-acetylglucosamine in the cell wall, leading to cell lysis.Cephalexin is a first generation cephalosporin antibiotic."
475,DB00568,"Cinnarizine is a specific calcium channel blocker that primarily works on the central vestibular system to interfere with the signal transmission between vestibular apparatus of the inner ear and the vomiting centre of the hypothalamus. Cinnarizine could be also viewed as a nootropic drug because of its vasorelaxating abilities (due to calcium channel blockage), which happen mostly in brain. Histamines mediate a number of activities such as contraction of smooth muscle of the airways and gastrointestinal tract, vasodilatation, cardiac stimulation, secretion of gastric acid, promotion of interleukin release and chemotaxis of eosinophils and mast cells. Cinnarizine through its calcium channel blocking ability also inhibits stimulation of the vestibular system.Cinnarizine inhibits contractions of vascular smooth muscle cells by blocking L-type and T-type voltage gated calcium channels. Cinnarizine has also been implicated in binding to dopamine D2 receptors, histamine H1 receptors, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors."
476,DB00569,"The monomeric sequence in heparin and HS is thought to form the high affinity binding site for the natural anti-coagulant factor, antithrombin III (ATIII). Once bound to heparin or HS, the anticoagulant activity of ATIII is potentiated by 1000-fold. By selectively binding to ATIII, Fondaparinux potentiates (about 300 times) the neutralization of Factor Xa by ATIII. Neutralization of Factor Xa interrupts the blood coagulation cascade and thus inhibits thrombin formation and thrombus development. As a result, fondaparinux has been used as an alternative anticoagulant in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) patients ."

The vinca alkaloids have become clinically useful since the discovery of their antitumour properties in 1959."
478,DB00571,"Propranolol is indicated to treat hypertension. Propranolol is used to treat a number of conditions but most commonly is used for hypertension. Propranolol has a long duration of action as it is given once or twice daily depending on the indication. When patients abruptly stop taking propranolol, they may experience exacerbations of angina and myocardial infarctions.Propranolol is a nonselective Î²-adrenergic receptor antagonist. Blocking of these receptors leads to vasoconstriction, inhibition of angiogenic factors like vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic growth factor of fibroblasts (bFGF), induction of apoptosis of endothelial cells, as well as down regulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system."
479,DB00572,"The intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intraosseous and endotracheal use of atropine is indicated for the temporary blockade of severe or life-threatening muscarinic effects. Atropine is a competitive, reversible antagonist of muscarinic receptors that blocks the effects of acetylcholine and other choline esters. Compared to , atropine has a more potent and prolonged effect on the heart, intestine and bronchial muscle, but a weaker effect on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands. Atropine can be used to prevent or abolish bradycardia or asystole induced by the injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Also, it acts in less innervated smooth muscle that responds to endogenous acetylcholine."
480,DB00573,"It is pharmacologically similar to aspirin, but causes less gastrointestinal bleeding.Fenoprofen is a propionic acid derivative with analgesic, antiinflammatory and antipyretic properties. Fenoprofen inhibits prostaglandin synthesis by decreasing the enzyme needed for biosynthesis. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the anti-inflammatory action of fenoprofen has been evidenced by relief of pain, increase in grip strength, and reductions in joint swelling, duration of morning stiffness, and disease activity (as assessed by both the investigator and the patient). In patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, clinical studies have shown fenoprofen to be comparable to aspirin in controlling the aforementioned measures of disease activity, but mild gastrointestinal reactions (nausea, dyspepsia) and tinnitus occurred less frequently in patients treated with fenoprofen than in aspirin-treated patients. In patients with pain, the analgesic action of fenoprofen has produced a reduction in pain intensity, an increase in pain relief, improvement in total analgesia scores, and a sustained analgesic effect.Fenoprofen's exact mode of action is unknown, but it is thought that prostaglandin synthetase inhibition is involved."
481,DB00574,"Fenfluramine is indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome and  Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in patients aged two years and older.Dravet syndrome is a pediatric encephalopathy that typically manifests within the first year of life following exposure to elevated temperatures. It is characterized by recurrent pharmacoresistant seizures, which increase in frequency and severity with disease progression. Through its ability to modulate neurotransmission, fenfluramine has reemerged as an effective therapy against pharmacoresistant seizures, such as those involved in Dravet syndrome. Fenfluramine should be gradually withdrawn following treatment alteration or cessation.Dravet syndrome is a complex pediatric encephalopathy characterized by recurrent pharmacoresistant seizures of variable type, delayed development, and in many cases, impairment in speech, language, gait, and other neurocognitive functions. Various _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ studies have demonstrated that fenfluramine is capable of acting as an agonist of multiple serotonin receptors including 5-HT1A, 5-HT1D, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C, as well as a Ï1 receptor antagonist."
482,DB00575,"An extended release tablet of clonidine is indicated for the treatment of ADHD either alone or in combination with other medications.Clonidine is an imidazole derivate that acts as an agonist of alpha-2 adrenoceptors. Clonidine was granted FDA approval on 3 September 1974.Clonidine functions through agonism of alpha-2 adrenoceptors which have effects such as lowering blood pressure, sedation, and hyperpolarization of nerves. The alpha-2 adrenoceptor is coupled to the G-proteins Go and Gi. Gu inhibits adenylyl cyclase and activates opening of a potassium channel that causes hyperpolarization. Ciding to the alpha-2 adrenoceptor causes structural changes in the alpha subunit of the G-protein, reducing its affinity for GDP."
483,DB00576,"The sulfonamides are synthetic bacteriostatic antibiotics with a wide spectrum against most gram-positive and many gram-negative organisms. However, many strains of an individual species may be resistant. Bacterial sensitivity is the same for the various sulfonamides, and resistance to one sulfonamide indicates resistance to all. Their antibacterial action is inhibited by pus.Sulfamethizole is a competitive inhibitor of bacterial enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase. The inhibited reaction is necessary in these organisms for the synthesis of folic acid."

It inhibits uptake of catecholamines and blocks the binding of cocaine to the dopamine uptake transporter. Mazindol is only approved in the United States for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and is not marketed or available in the United States for use in the treatment of obesity.Mazindol is a sympathomimetic amine that stimulates the central nervous system (nerves and brain), leading to increased your heart rate and blood pressure, and decreased appetite. Since the appetite-suppressing effect of the drug tends to decrease after few weeks of treatment, sympathomimetic appetite suppressants are typically used short-term weight-loss program. Unlike other sympathomimetic appetite suppressants such as phentermine, mazindol is thought to inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine rather than to cause its release."
487,DB00580,"For the treatment of osteoarthritis and dysmenorrhoeaValdecoxib was removed from the Canadian, U.S., and E.U. markets in 2005 due to concerns about a possible increased risk of heart attack and stroke.Valdecoxib, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, is classified as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Valdecoxib is used for its anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activities in the management of osteoarthritis (OA) and for the treatment of dysmenorrhea or acute pain. Unlike celecoxib, valdecoxib lacks a sulfonamide chain and does not require CYP450 enzymes for metabolism.Both COX-1 and COX-2 catalyze the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin (PG) H2, the precursor of PGs and thromboxane. Valdecoxib selectively inhibits the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme, important for the mediation of inflammation and pain."
488,DB00581,"Lactulose is indicated for use as a laxative in the treatment of chronic constipation in adults and geriatric patients. Moreover, there have also been studies demonstrating the capacity for lactulose to minimize the formation of gallstones and even some investigations regarding the experimental use of the agent in developing novel anticancer agents owing to its ability to bind galactin carbohydrates involved in various tumor progressions .Lactulose is a synthetic disaccharide derivative of lactose that is most commonly used as a laxative agent despite also being formally indicated to serve as an adjunct therapy in treating portal-systemic encephalopathy (PSE). Nevertheless, although lactulose received formal FDA approval in 1977 and has since become a readily available generic and brand-name non-prescription medication listed on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines as one of the most effective and safe medicines employed in a health system, data regarding its optimal place in therapy is often ambiguous. Especially considering the use of lactulose as a laxative is typically only considered after lifestyle and dietary modifications fail and the fact that lactulose therapy cannot be ethically withheld from patients diagnosed with PSE in a placebo study, the substance may just be one of many options available for treating constipation and its efficacy in managing PSE may never be formally confirmed or refuted via clinical investigation.Lactulose formulations are most commonly administered via the oral route or the rectal route. At the same time, the formation of such acids via the metabolism of lactulose by colonic bacteria also acidifies the contents of the colon, thereby contributing to the treatment of portal-systemic encephalopathy (PSE)."

It also exports acyl groups from subcellular organelles and from cells to urine before they accumulate to toxic concentrations. Further, this condition may be associated with a plasma concentration ratio of acylcarnitine/levocarnitine greater than 0.4 or abnormally elevated concentrations of acylcarnitine in the urine. Levocarnitine can be used therapeutically to stimulate gastric and pancreatic secretions and in the treatment of hyperlipoproteinemias.Levocarnitine can be synthesised within the body from the amino acids lysine or methionine."
491,DB00584,"Indicated for the treatment of symptomatic congestive heart failure, usually in combination with diuretics and digitalis. Indicated for the management of asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction in patients with an ejection fraction of ï¿½?to 35 percent to decrease the rate of development of overt heart failure and the incidence of hospitalization for heart failure.Enalapril is a prodrug belonging to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor drug class that works on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which is responsible for the regulation of blood pressure and fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. The active metabolite of enalapril competitively inhibits the ACE to hinder the production of angiotensin II, a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system that promotes vasoconstriction and renal reabsorption of sodium ions in the kidneys. Enalapril is a pharmacologically inactive prodrug that requires hepatic biotransformation to form , its active metabolite that works on the RAAS to inhibit ACE. While inhibition of ACE leading to suppression of RAAS is thought to be the primary mechanism of action of enalapril, the drug was shown to still exert antihypertensive effects on individuals with low-renin hypertension."
492,DB00585,"For the treatment of acid-reflux disorders (GERD), peptic ulcer disease, active benign gastric ulcer, and active duodenal ulcer.A histamine H2 receptor antagonist with low toxicity that inhibits gastric acid secretion. The drug is used for the treatment of duodenal ulcers.Nizatidine is a competitive, reversible inhibitor of histamine at the histamine H2-receptors, particularly those in the gastric parietal cells. Nizatidine had no demonstrable antiandrogenic action. It has been demonstrated that treatment with a reduced dose of nizatidine is effective as maintenance therapy following healing of active duodenal ulcers.Nizatidine competes with histamine for binding at the H2-receptors on the gastric basolateral membrane of parietal cells. The drug also decreases the gastric acid response to stimuli such as food, caffeine, insulin, betazole, or pentagastrin."
493,DB00586,"Diclofenac was the product of rational drug design based on the structures of , , and . It also increases the risk of developing a gastrointestinal ulcer by inhibiting the production of protective mucus in the stomach.Diclofenac inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 and -2, the enzymes responsible for production of prostaglandin (PG) G2 which is the precursor to other PGs. The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents. PGI2 and PGE2 contribute to acute inflammation via their IP and EP2 receptors. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation."
494,DB00588,"Fluticasone propionate is indicated as an inhaler for the treatment and management of asthma by prophylaxisas well as inflammatory and pruritic dermatoses. Fluticasone propionate nasal spray is indicated for managing allergic and nonallergic rhinitis.Fluticasone propionate is a synthetic glucocorticoid. These drugs are available as inhalers, nasal, sprays, and topical treatments for various inflammatory indications. Fluticasone propionate was first approved in 1990.Systemically, fluticasone propionate activates glucocorticoid receptors, and inhibits lung eosinophilia in rats. Fluticasone propionate as a topical formulation is also associated with vasoconstriction in the skin.Fluticasone propionate works through an unknown mechanism to  affect the action of various cell types and mediators of inflammation."
495,DB00589,"For the management of Parkinson's DiseaseAn ergot derivative that acts as an agonist at dopamine D2 receptors (dopamine agonists). It may also act as an antagonist at dopamine D1 receptors, and as an agonist at some serotonin receptors (serotonin agonists).There is evidence that lisuride lowers prolactin levels and, in low doses, prevents migraine attacks. Lisuride is an anti-Parkinson drug chemically related to the dopaminergic ergoline Parkinson's drugs. Lisuride binds to the 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A/2C) receptors. It is also thought to bind to the dopamine receptor and to act as a dopamine agonist."
496,DB00590,"Doxazosin is indicated to treat the symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy, which may include urinary frequency, urgency, and nocturia, among other symptoms. It is marketed by Pfizer and was initially approved by the FDA in 1990.Doxazosin decreases standing and supine blood pressure and relieves the symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy through the inhibition of alpha-1 receptors. The first dose of doxazosin may lead to such effects, however, subsequent doses may also cause them. Patients must be advised of the priapism risk associated with doxazosin and to seek medical attention immediately if it is suspected.Doxazosin selectively inhibits the postsynaptic alpha-1 receptors on vascular smooth muscle by nonselectively blocking the alpha-1a, alpha-1b, and alpha-1d subtypes. Norepinephrine-activated alpha-1 receptors located on the prostate gland and bladder neck normally cause contraction of regional muscular tissue, obstructing urinary flow and contributing to the symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy."
497,DB00591,"-It has been used in shampoo products as a low to medium potency corticosteroid for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp. -As an intravitreal implant, it is indicated for the treatment of diabetic macular edema with patients that have been previously treated with a course of corticosteroids and no clinically significant rise in intraocular pressure. -Some reports have indicated the use of fluocinolone acetonide as a vasoprotective agent and for its use in the treatment of first-degree hemorrhoids.Fluocinolone acetonide, with the formula 6-alpha, 9-alpha-difluoro-16-alpha, 17 alpha-acetonide, is a corticosteroid that presents a high lipophilicity. This type of device containing fluocinolone acetonide was developed by Taro Pharmaceuticals and approved by FDA in May 2016.Fluocinolone acetonide is a synthetic anti-inflammatory corticosteroid and thus, the effect of its interaction with the body produces vasoconstriction and suppression of membrane permeability, mitotic activity, immune response and release of inflammatory mediators. Hence, the induction of these proteins will prevent the release of arachidonic acid by phospholipase A2."
498,DB00592,"First used as a solvent for uric acid, the use of piperazine as an anthelmintic agent was first introduced in 1953. Upon entry into the systemic circulation, the drug is partly oxidized and partly eliminated as an unchanged compound. Piperazine compounds mediate their anthelmintic action by generally paralyzing parasites, allowing the host body to easily remove or expel the invading organism.Piperazine is an anthelminthic especially useful in the treatment of partial intestinal obstruction caused by Ascaris worms, which is a condition primarily seen in children. Piperazine hydrate and piperazine citrate are the main anthelminthic piperazines.Piperazine is a GABA receptor agonist. Piperzine binds directly and selectively to muscle membrane GABA receptors, presumably causing hyperpolarization of nerve endings, resulting in flaccid paralysis of the worm."
499,DB00593,"For the treatment of petit mal epilepsy.An anticonvulsant especially useful in the treatment of absence seizures unaccompanied by other types of seizures.Used in the treatment of epilepsy. Ethosuximide suppresses the paroxysmal three cycle per second spike and wave activity associated with lapses of consciousness which is common in absence (petit mal) seizures. The frequency of epileptiform attacks is reduced, apparently by depression of the motor cortex and elevation of the threshold of the central nervous system to convulsive stimuli.Binds to T-type voltage sensitive calcium channels. Voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) mediate the entry of calcium ions into excitable cells and are also involved in a variety of calcium-dependent processes, including muscle contraction, hormone or neurotransmitter release, gene expression, cell motility, cell division and cell death. The isoform alpha-1G gives rise to T-type calcium currents."
500,DB00594,"For use as adjunctive treatment with thiazide diuretics or other kaliuretic-diuretic agents in congestive heart failure or hypertension.A pyrazine compound inhibiting sodium reabsorption through sodium channels in renal epithelial cells. This inhibition creates a negative potential in the luminal membranes of principal cells, located in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct. Amiloride is used in conjunction with diuretics to spare potassium loss. It is an antihypertensive, potassium-sparing diuretic that was first approved for use in 1967 and helps to treat hypertension and congestive heart failure. Amiloride exerts its potassium sparing effect through the inhibition of sodium reabsorption at the distal convoluted tubule, cortical collecting tubule and collecting duct; this decreases the net negative potential of the tubular lumen and reduces both potassium and hydrogen secretion and their subsequent excretion."
501,DB00595,"Oxytetracycline is indicated for treatment of infections caused by a variety of Gram positive and Gram negative microorganisms including <i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Pasteurella pestis, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae</i> (respiratory infections), and <i>Diplococcus pneumoniae</i>.A tetracycline analog isolated from the actinomycete streptomyces rimosus and used in a wide variety of clinical conditions.Oxytetracycline is known as a broad-spectrum antibiotic due to its activity against such a wide range of infections. It was the second of the tetracyclines to be discovered. Its better absorption profile makes it preferable to tetracycline for moderately severe acne, but alternatives sould be sought if no improvement occurs by 3 months.Oxytetracycline inhibits cell growth by inhibiting translation. The binding is reversible in nature. Oxytetracycline is lipophilic and can easily pass through the cell membrane or passively diffuses through porin channels in the bacterial membrane."
502,DB00596,"Ulobetasol lotion is indicated in the treatment of plaque psoriasis.Ulobetasol is a highly potent corticosteroid. It is structurally related to . Due to its high potency, it is mainly prescribed in the treatment of severe plaque psoriasis and corticosteroid responsive dermatoses. Corticosteroids have a wide therapeutic window as patients may require doses that are multiples of what the body naturally produces. Lower doses of corticosteroids provide an anti-inflammatory effect, while higher doses are immunosuppressive."
503,DB00597,"Gadoteridol is indicated for use with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in order to visualize lesions with disrupted blood-brain barrier and/or abnormal vascularity in the brain, spine, and associated tissues in adult and pediatric patients, including term neonates. It is also indicated for visualization of lesions in the head and neck in adult patients.Gadoteridol is a macrocyclic nonionic gadolinium that provides contrast enhancement of the brain, spine, and surrounding tissues, resulting in improved visualization (compared with unenhanced MRI) of lesions with abnormal vascularity or those thought to disrupt the normal blood-brain barrier. Consistently, for all gadolinium-based contrast agents, the relaxivity of gadoteridol decreases with the increase of the magnetic field strength used in clinical MRI (0.2 ï¿½?.0T). Gadoteridol is a paramagnetic agent and, as such, develops a magnetic moment when placed in a magnetic field. When placed in a magnetic field, gadoteridol decreases T1 relaxation times in the target tissues."
504,DB00598,Labetalol is formulated as an injection or tablets to treat hypertension. Labetalol was granted FDA approval on 1 August 1984.Labetalol antagonizes various adrenergic receptors to decrease blood pressure. Antagonism of alpha-1-adrenergic receptors leads to vasodilation and decreased vascular resistance. This leads to a decrease in blood pressure that is most pronounced while standing. Antagonism of beta-1-adrenergic receptors leads to a slight decrease in heart rate.
505,DB00599,"For use as the sole anesthetic agent for brief (15 minute) procedures, for induction of anesthesia prior to administration of other anesthetic agents, to supplement regional anesthesia, to provide hypnosis during balanced anesthesia with other agents for analgesia or muscle relaxation, for the control of convulsive states during or following inhalation anesthesia or local anesthesia, in neurosurgical patients with increased intracranial pressure, and for narcoanalysis and narcosynthesis in psychiatric disorders.A barbiturate that is administered intravenously for the induction of general anesthesia or for the production of complete anesthesia of short duration. It has been used in neurosurgical patients to reduce increased intracranial pressure. It does not produce any excitation but has poor analgesic and muscle relaxant properties. Small doses have been shown to be anti-analgesic and lower the pain threshold. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p920)Thiopental, a barbiturate, is used for the induction of anesthesia prior to the use of other general anesthetic agents and for induction of anesthesia for short surgical, diagnostic, or therapeutic procedures associated with minimal painful stimuli."

Monobenzone occurs as a white, almost tasteless crystalline powder, soluble in alcohol and practically insoluble in water. It exerts a depigmenting effect on skin of mammals by increasing the excretion of melanin from the melanocytes. It may also cause destruction of melanocytes and permanent depigmentation.Monobenzone is the monobenzyl ether of hydroquinone. Monobenzone, applied topically to the skin, is used as a depigmenting agent inhibitting melanin&nbsp;produced by polymerization of oxidation products of tyrosine and dihydroxyphenyl compounds."
507,DB00601,"Examples of susceptible bacteria include _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, _Streptococcus pyogenes_, and _Streptococcus agalactiae_. Linezolid is not indicated for the treatment of Gram-negative infections, nor has it been evaluated for use longer than 28 days.Linezolid is a synthetic antibiotic which is used for the treatment of infections caused by aerobic Gram-positive bacteria. Linezolid has shown some _in vitro_ activity against Gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria but is not considered efficacious against these organisms. Linezolid is a reversible and non-selective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzymes and can therefore contribute to the development of serotonin syndrome when administered alongside serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Point mutations in the bacterial 23S rRNA can lead to linezolid resistance, and the development of linezolid-resistant _Enterococcus faecium_ and _Staphylococcus aureus_ have been documented during its clinical use."
508,DB00602,"months of age. Ivermectin is mainly used in humans in the treatment of onchocerciasis, but may also be effective against other worm infestations (such as strongyloidiasis, ascariasis, trichuriasis and enterobiasis). Applied topically, it may be used in the treatment of head lice infestation. With the advent of 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic, ivermectin began garnering notoriety due to its off-label use for the prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19. It is an avermectin, a group of pentacyclic sixteen-membered lactones (i.e. a macrocyclic lactone disaccharide) derived from the soil bacterium _Streptomyces avermitilis_."
509,DB00603,"MPA can be use to treat secondary amenorrhea, endometrial hyperplasia, abnormal uterine bleeding, osteoporosis, vasomotor symptoms in menopause, vulvar and vaginal atrophy, prevent pregnancy, manage pain in endometriosis, prevent pregnancy, and is also used in palliative care for endometrial and renal carcinoma. Medroxyprogesterone acetate was granted FDA approval on 18 June 1959.Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) inhibits gonadotropin production, reduces nuclear estrogen receptors and DNA synthesis in epithelial cells of the endometrium, and induces p53 dependant apoptosis in cancer cell lines. The therapeutic window is wide as patients may take doses ranging from 5mg orally daily to 1000mg as a depo injection weekly. Long term use of MPA is associated with a reduction in bone density and patients who taking MPA during adolescence may have lower peak bone mass than untreated patients, which can also increase the risk of osteoporosis and fractures in the future.Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) inhibits the production of gonadotropin, preventing follicular maturation and ovulation, which is responsible for itâs ability to prevent pregnancy. MPA reduces nuclear estrogen receptors and DNA synthesis in epithelial cells of the endometrium."
510,DB00604,"For the symptomatic treatment of adult patients with nocturnal heartburn due to gastroesophageal reflux disease.In many countries (including Canada) cisapride has been either withdrawn or has had its indications limited due to reports about long QT syndrome due to cisapride, which predisposes to arrhythmias. The FDA issued a warning letter regarding this risk to health care professionals and patients.Cisapride is a parasympathomimetic which acts as a serotonin 5-HT<sub>4</sub> agonist; upon activation of the receptor signaling pathway, cisapride promotes the release of acetylcholine neurotransmitters in the enteric nervous system. Cisapride stimulates motility of the upper gastrointestinal tract without stimulating gastric, biliary, or pancreatic secretions. Cisapride increases the tone and amplitude of gastric (especially antral) contractions, relaxes the pyloric sphincter and the duodenal bulb, and increases peristalsis of the duodenum and jejunum resulting in accelerated gastric emptying and intestinal transit. It has little, if any, effect on the motility of the colon or gallbladder."
511,DB00605,"For acute or long-term use in the relief of signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, acute painful shoulder (acute subacromial bursitis/supraspinatus tendinitis), and acute gouty arthritis.Sulindac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of the arylalkanoic acid class that is marketed by Merck under the brand name Clinoril. Like other NSAIDs, it may be used in the treatment of acute or chronic inflammatory conditions. Sulindac is a prodrug, derived from sulfinylindene, that is converted _in vivo_ to an active sulfide compound by liver enzymes. There is evidence from some studies that sulindac may be associated with fewer gastrointestinal side effects than other NSAIDs, except for the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor drug class. While its full mechanism of action is not fully understood, sulindac is thought to primarily mediate its action by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2.Sulindac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory indene derivative, also possessing analgesic and antipyretic activities.Sulindac's exact mechanism of action is unknown."
512,DB00606,"It is also indicated in the management of hypertension either as the sole therapeutic agent or to enhance the effectiveness of other antihypertensive drugs in the more severe forms of hypertension.As a diuretic, cyclothiazide inhibits active chloride reabsorption at the early distal tubule via the Na-Cl cotransporter, resulting in an increase in the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water. Natriuresis may be accompanied by some loss of potassium and bicarbonate.Hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, inhibits water reabsorption in the nephron by inhibiting the sodium-chloride symporter (SLC12A3) in the distal convoluted tubule, which is responsible for 5% of total sodium reabsorption. Once sodium has entered the cell, it is transported out into the basolateral interstitium via the sodium-potassium ATPase, causing an increase in the osmolarity of the interstitium, thereby establishing an osmotic gradient for water reabsorption. By blocking the sodium-chloride symporter, hydrochlorothiazide effectively reduces the osmotic gradient and water reabsorption throughout the nephron.Hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, inhibits water reabsorption in the nephron by inhibiting the sodium-chloride symporter (SLC12A3) in the distal convoluted tubule, which is responsible for 5% of total sodium reabsorption.

It is a beta-lactamase-resistant penicillin that is indicated for the treatment of Staphylococcal infections caused by strains that are resistant to other penicillins, except those caused by MRSA. It may be used as a first-line therapy in Methicillin-Sensitive *Staphylococcus aureus* infections .Nafcillin is a semisynthetic antibiotic substance derived from 6-amino-penicillanic acid. The drugs in this class are highly resistant to inactivation by staphylococcal penicillinase and are active against penicillinase-producing and non penicillinase-producing strains of Staphylococcus species. It inhibits the biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall by forming covalent bonds with penicillin-binding proteins that play a critical role in the final transpeptidation process."
514,DB00608,"Chloroquine is also used off label for the treatment of rheumatic diseases, as well as treatment and prophylaxis of Zika virus. Chloroquine is currently undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19.Chloroquine is an aminoquinolone derivative first developed in the 1940s for the treatment of malaria. It was the drug of choice to treat malaria until the development of newer antimalarials such as , , and . The raised pH in endosomes, prevent virus particles from utilizing their activity for fusion and entry into the cell. Chloroquine does not affect the level of ACE2 expression on cell surfaces, but inhibits terminal glycosylation of ACE2, the receptor that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 target for cell entry."

In a study examining ethionamide resistance, ethionamide administered orally initially decreased the number of culturable <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> organisms from the lungs of H37Rv infected mice. It is thought that ethionamide undergoes intracellular modification and acts in a similar fashion to isoniazid. Specifically isoniazid inhibits InhA, the enoyl reductase from <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, by forming a covalent adduct with the NAD cofactor."
516,DB00610,"For the treatment and prevention of hypotension due to hemorrhage, spinal anesthesia, and shock associated with brain damageAn adrenergic agonist that acts predominantly at alpha adrenergic receptors and also stimulates the release of norepinephrine. It has been used primarily as a vasoconstrictor in the treatment of hypotension.Metaraminol is a potent sympathomimetic amine that increases both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. It acts by increasing the force of the heart's pumping action as well as constricting peripheral blood vessels.Metaraminol acts through peripheral vasoconstriction by acting as a pure alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonist, consequently increasing systemic blood pressure (both systolic &amp; diastolic). Its effect is thought to be associated with the inhibition of adenyl cyclase which leads to an inhibition of the production of cAMP. Another effect of Metaraminol is that it releases norepinephrine from its storage sites indirectly."
517,DB00611,"It is used in the management of severe pain.Butorphanol is a synthetic opioid agonist-antagonist analgesic with a pharmacological and therapeutic profile that has been well established since its launch as a parenteral formulation in 1978. This route of administration bypasses the gastrointestinal tract, and this is an advantage for a drug such as butorphanol that undergoes significant first-pass metabolism after oral administration. The onset of action and systemic bioavailability of butorphanol following transnasal delivery are similar to those after parenteral administration. The opiate antagonistic effect may result from competitive inhibition at the opiate receptor, but may also be a result of other mechanisms. Butorphanol is believed to have both partial agonism and partial antagonism at the Î¼-opioid receptor, as well as partial agonist and antagonist activity at the Îº-opioid receptor."
518,DB00612,"It may be used off-label to treat heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and angina pectoris.Bisoprolol is a cardioselective Î²1-adrenergic blocking agent used to treat high blood pressure. Bisoprolol is generally well tolerated, likely due to its Î²1-adrenergic receptor selectivity and is a useful alternative to non-selective Î²-blocker drugs in the treatment of hypertension such as  and . It may be used alone or in combination with other drugs to manage hypertension and can be useful in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to its receptor selectivity.Bisoprolol decreases heart rate (chronotropy), decreases contractility (inotropy), and reduces blood pressure. Though the mechanism of action of bisoprolol has not been fully elucidated in hypertension, it is thought that therapeutic effects are achieved through the antagonism of Î²-1adrenoceptors to result in lower cardiac output. Bisoprolol reduces cardiac workload by decreasing contractility and the need for oxygen through competitive inhibition of Î²1-adrenergic receptors."
519,DB00613,"For treatment of acute malarial attacks in non-immune subjects.A 4-aminoquinoquinoline compound with anti-inflammatory properties.Amodiaquine, a 4-aminoquinoline similar to chloroquine in structure and activity, has been used as both an antimalarial and an anti-inflammatory agent for more than 40 years. The mode of action of amodiaquine has not yet been determined. 4-Aminoquinolines depress cardiac muscle, impair cardiac conductivity, and produce vasodilatation with resultant hypotension. Like other quinoline derivatives, it is thought to inhibit heme polymerase activity. This results in accumulation of free heme, which is toxic to the parasites."

Specifically, it interacts with bacterial RNA polymerase but does not inhibit the mammalian enzyme. It is bactericidal and has a very broad spectrum of activity against most gram-positive and gram-negative organisms (including <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>) and specifically <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>. Because of rapid emergence of resistant bacteria, use is restricted to treatment of mycobacterial infections and a few other indications. Rifabutin is well absorbed when taken orally and is distributed widely in body tissues and fluids, including the CSF."
521,DB00617,"Used for the control of absence (petit mal) seizures that are refractory to treatment with other medications.Paramethadione is an anticonvulsant in the oxazolidinedione class. It is associated with fetal trimethadione syndrome, which is also known as paramethadione syndrome.Paramethadione is an oxazolidinedione anticonvulsant similar to trimethadione that acts on the central nervous system (CNS) to reduce the number of absence seizures (often seen in epileptics). Absence seizures involve an interruption to consciousness where the person experiencing the seizure seems to become vacant and unresponsive for a short period of time (usually up to 30 seconds). Paramethadione acts on thalamic neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus (which studies have shown to be associated with absence seizures, von Krosigk et al., 1993).Dione anticonvulsants such as paramethadione reduce T-type calcium currents in thalamic neurons (including thalamic relay neurons). This inhibits corticothalamic transmission and raises the threshold for repetitive activity in the thalamus."
522,DB00618,"Used primarily to treat Lyme disease, acne, and bronchitis. Also indicated (but rarely used) to treat urinary tract infections, gum disease, malaria, and other bacterial infections such as gonorrhea and chlamydia. Demeclocycline is not a direct bactericidal agent; rather, it is a bacteriostatic drug that impairs bacterial growth. Because it is excreted more slowly than tetracycline, it maintains effective blood levels for longer periods of time.Demeclocycline inhibits cell growth by inhibiting translation. It is not completely understood why demeclocycline impairs the action of antidiuretic hormone, but it is thought that it blocks the binding of the hormone to its receptor."
523,DB00619,"Imatinib is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric chronic myeloid leukemia with Philadelphia chromosome mutation (Ph+) in blast crisis, accelerated phase, or chronic phase after IFN-alpha therapy failure. Therefore, the BCR-ABL pathway is an attractive target for cancer treatment. Cancer cells, on the other hand, can have a dependence on BCR-ABL, thus more heavily impacted by imatinib. Imatinib mesylate is a protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, the constitutively active tyrosine kinase created by the Philadelphia chromosome abnormality in CML.Although the function of normal BCR is still unclear, ABL activation is overexpressed in various tumors and is heavily implicated in cancer cells growth and survival. Imatinib inhibits the BCR-ABL protein by binding to the ATP pocket in the active site, thus preventing downstream phosphorylation of target protein."

Its properties and uses are generally similar to those of chlorpromazine.Fluphenazine is a trifluoro-methyl phenothiazine derivative intended for the management of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Fluphenazine has not been shown effective in the management of behaviorial complications in patients with mental retardation.Fluphenazine blocks postsynaptic mesolimbic dopaminergic D1 and D2 receptors in the brain; depresses the release of hypothalamic and hypophyseal hormones and is believed to depress the reticular activating system thus affecting basal metabolism, body temperature, wakefulness, vasomotor tone, and emesis."
528,DB00624,"Testosterone is indicated to treat primary hypogonadism and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.Testosterone is a steroid sex hormone indicated to treat primary hypogonadism and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Testosterone antagonizes the androgen receptor to induce gene expression that causes the growth and development of masculine sex organs and secondary sexual characteristics. The duration of action of testosterone is variable from patient to patient with a half life of 10-100 minutes. The therapeutic index is wide considering the normal testosterone levels in an adult man range from 300-1000ng/dL.

For HIV infection that has not previously been treated, efavirenz and lamivudine in combination with zidovudine or tenofovir is the preferred NNRTI-based regimen. Currently, the CDC recommends that Efavirenz be given as part of a three-drug regimen that includes another nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (e.g., lamivudine, stavudine, zidovudine) and a protease inhibitor or efavirenz when treating HIV infection.Similar to zidovudine, efavirenz inhibits the activity of viral RNA-directed DNA polymerase (i.e., reverse transcriptase). Antiviral activity of efavirenz is dependent on intracellular conversion to the active triphosphorylated form. The rate of efavirenz phosphorylation varies, depending on cell type."
530,DB00626,"Bacitracin is indicated in topical formulations for acute and chronic localized skin infections. Occasionally, it is also used intramuscularly for infantile streptococcal pneumonia and empyema. Bacitracin is also formulated as an ointment with neomycin and polymyxin B for over the counter use. Bacitracin was granted FDA approval on 29 July 1948.Bacitracin is a mixture of polypeptides that prevent the formation of the bacterial cell wall and oxidatively cleave DNA. Bacitracin metal complexes also bind and oxidatively cleave DNA."
531,DB00627,"Niacin oral tablets are indicated as a monotherapy or in combination with simvastatin or lovastatin to treat primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. Finally niacin is indicated to treat severe hypertriglyceridemia.Niacin is a B vitamin used to treat vitamin deficiencies as well as hyperlipidemia, dyslipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and to reduce the risk of myocardial infarctions.Niacin is a B vitamin used to treat vitamin deficiencies as well as hyperlipidemia, dyslipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and to reduce the risk of myocardial infarctions. Niacin acts to decrease levels of very low density lipoproteins and low density lipoproteins, while increasing levels of high density lipoproteins. This activity also leads to intracellular degradation of apo B and decreased production of low density lipoproteins, the catabolic product of VLDL. Niacin also inhibits a high density lipoprotein (HDL) catabolism receptor, which increases the levels and half life of HDL."
532,DB00628,"It is also used as adjunctive therapy in the management of partial seizures and for the symptomatic relief of acute alcohol withdrawal.Clorazepic acid (clorazepate) is a water-soluble benzodiazepine with muscle-relaxant and anticonvulsant actions effective in the treatment of anxiety. Following administration, clorazepate is rapidly converted to nordiazepam (N-desmethyldiazepam), its active metabolite, before entering systemic circulation. Similar to other benzodiazepines, the active metabolite of clorazepate enhances the binding of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to the GABA type A (GABA-A) receptor, which promotes channel opening and neuronal hyperpolarization. The use of benzodiazepines, including clorazepate, exposes users to abuse, misuse, and addiction risks, which can lead to overdose and death. The concomitant use of clorazepate with opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death.Clorazepate is a benzodiazepine with depressant effects on the central nervous system."
533,DB00629,"For management of High blood pressureAn alpha-2 selective adrenergic agonist used as an antihypertensive agent. Guanabenz, a centrally acting &alpha;-2 adrenergic agonist, is indicated for treatment of hypertension.Guanabenz's antihypertensive effect is thought to be due to central alpha-adrenergic stimulation, which results in a decreased sympathetic outflow to the heart, kidneys, and peripheral vasculature in addition to a decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure and a slight slowing of pulse rate. Chronic administration of guanabenz also causes a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance."
534,DB00630,"Alendronic acid is indicated for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in men and postmenopausal women, treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, and Paget's disease of bone. However, alendronic acid is not indicated for use in pediatric populations or patients with a creatinine clearance <35mL/min.Alendronic acid is a second generation bisphosphonate that is used for the treatment of some forms of osteoperosis and Paget's disease. It functions by preventing resorption of bone.Alendronic acid tablets have a very low oral bioavialability. After administration it distributes into soft tissue and bone or is excreted in the urine. Alendronic acid does not undergo metabolism.Alendronic acid binds to bone hydroxyapatite."
535,DB00631,"It is designated as an orphan drug by the FDA for this use.Clofarabine is a purine nucleoside antimetabolite that is being studied in the treatment of cancer. Clofarabine is used in paediatrics to treat a type of leukaemia called relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), only after at least two other types of treatment have failed. Clofarabine prevents cells from making DNA and RNA by interfering with the synthesis of nucleic acids, thus stopping the growth of cancer cells.Clofarabine is metabolized intracellularly to the active 5'-monophosphate metabolite by deoxycytidine kinase and 5'-triphosphate metabolite by mono- and di-phospho-kinases. This metabolite inhibits DNA synthesis through an inhibitory action on ribonucleotide reductase, and by terminating DNA chain elongation and inhibiting repair through competitive inhibition of DNA polymerases. This leads to the depletion of the intracellular deoxynucleotide triphosphate pool and the self-potentiation of clofarabine triphosphate incorporation into DNA, thereby intensifying the effectiveness of DNA synthesis inhibition."
536,DB00633,"Administered intravenously, dexmedetomidine is indicated for the sedation of initially intubated and mechanically ventilated patients during treatment in intensive care settings, and for the sedation of non-intubated patients prior to and/or during surgery and other procedures. It is also available as a buccally- or sublingually-administered dissolvable film for the acute treatment of agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar I or II disorder.An agonist of receptors, adrenergic alpha-2 that is used in veterinary medicine for its analgesic and sedative properties. It is the racemate of dexmedetomidine.Dexmedetomidine activates 2-adrenoceptors, and causes the decrease of sympathetic tone, with attenuation of the neuroendocrine and hemodynamic responses to anesthesia and surgery; it reduces anesthetic and opioid requirements; and causes sedation and analgesia.Dexmedetomidine is a specific and selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist. By binding to the presynaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptors, it inhibits the release if norepinephrine, therefore, terminate the propagation of pain signals. Activation of the postsynaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptors inhibits the sympathetic activity decreases blood pressure and heart rate."
537,DB00634,"For the treatment of bacterial vaginitis, keratitis, acute conjunctivitis, and blepharitis.An anti-infective agent that is used topically to treat skin infections and orally for urinary tract infections.Sulfacetamide is a sulfonamide antibiotic with bacteriostatic actions and broad-spectrum activity against most gram-positive and many gram-negative organisms. However, many strains of an individual species may be resistant. The sulfonamides are widely distributed throughout all tissues. High levels are achieved in pleural, peritoneal, synovial, and ocular fluids. Their antibacterial action is inhibited by pus.Sulfacetamide is a competitive inhibitor of bacterial para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), an essential component for bacterial growth (according to the Woods-Fildes theory)."
538,DB00635,"Prednisone is indicated as an anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive drug for allergic, dermatologic, gastrointestinal, hematologic, ophthalmologic, nervous system, renal, respiratory, rheumatologic, infectious, endocrine, or neoplastic conditions as well as in organ transplant.A synthetic anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid derived from . It is biologically inert and converted to  in the liver. Prednisone was granted FDA approval on 21 February 1955.Corticosteroids bind to the glucocorticoid receptor, inhibiting pro-inflammatory signals, and promoting anti-inflammatory signals. Prednisone has a short duration of action as the half life is 2-3 hours. Corticosteroids have a wide therapeutic window as patients make require doses that are multiples of what the body naturally produces."
539,DB00636,"For Primary Dysbetalipoproteinemia (Type III hyperlipidemia) that does not respond adequately to diet. Serum cholesterol may be decreased, particularly in those patients whose cholesterol elevation is due to the presence of IDL as a result of Type III hyperlipoproteinemia. Increase in LDL cholesterol has been observed in patients whose cholesterol is initially normal. This is accompanied by a slight increase in secretion of lipids into the bile and ultimately the intestine. This agonism ultimately leads to modification in gene expression resulting in increased beta-oxidation, decreased triglyceride secretion, increased HDL, increased lipoprotein lipase activity."
540,DB00637,"Astemizole was indicated for use in the relieving allergy symptoms, particularly rhinitis and conjunctivitis. It has been withdrawn from the market however due to concerns of arrhythmias.Astemizole is a long-acting, non-sedating second generation antihistamine used in the treatment of allergy symptoms. It does not significantly cross the blood brain barrier and therefore does not cause drowsiness or CNS depression at normal doses.Astemizole competes with histamine for binding at H1-receptor sites in the GI tract, uterus, large blood vessels, and bronchial muscle. As the drug does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier and preferentially binds at H1 receptors in the peripehery rather than within the brain, CNS depression is minimal. Astemizole may also act on H3-receptors, producing adverse effects."
541,DB00640,"It is also indicated to convert sinus rhythm of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.The structure of adenosine was first described in 1931, though the vasodilating effects were not described in literature until the 1940s. Adenosine was granted FDA approval on 30 October 1989.Adenosine is indicated as an adjunct to thallium-201 in myocardial perfusion scintigraphy and also indicated for conversion of sinus rhythm of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Adenosine has a short duration of action as the half life is <10 seconds, and a wide therapeutic window. Conduction time is decreased by inducing potassium efflux and inhibiting calcium influx through channels in nerve cells, leading to hyperpolarization and and increased threshold for calcium dependent action potentials. Inhibition of calcium influx, reduces the activity of adenylate cyclase, relaxing vascular smooth muscle."
542,DB00641,"Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint,  is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg  per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decrease in LDL cholesterol levels, while simvastatin has been found to have an average decrease in LDL-C of ~35%. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors coadministered with , and caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing these two medications together. Once hydrolyzed, simvastatin competes with HMG-CoA for HMG-CoA reductase, a hepatic microsomal enzyme, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis."
543,DB00642,"In the US, it is reserved for patients whose disease is unresectable or otherwise not candidates for curative surgery.Pemetrexed is a chemotherapy drug that is manufactured and marketed by Eli Lilly and Company under the brand name Alimta. Its use in non-small cell lung cancer has also been investigated. Based on population pharmacodynamic analyses, the depth of the absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) nadir correlates with systemic exposure to pemetrexed and supplementation with folic acid and vitamin B12. There is no cumulative effect of pemetrexed exposure on ANC nadir over multiple treatment cycles. The polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are inhibitors of TS and GARFT."
544,DB00643,"For the treatment of <i>Enterobius vermicularis</i> (pinworm), <i>Trichuris trichiura</i> (whipworm), <i>Ascaris lumbricoides</i> (common roundworm), <i>Ancylostoma duodenale</i> (common hookworm), <i>Necator americanus</i> (American hookworm) in single or mixed infections.A benzimidazole that acts by interfering with carbohydrate metabolism and inhibiting polymerization of microtubules. Mebendazole is a (synthetic) broad-spectrum anthelmintic. The principal mode of action for Mebendazole is by its inhibitory effect on tubulin polymerization which results in the loss of cytoplasmic microtubules.Mebendazole causes degenerative alterations in the tegument and intestinal cells of the worm by binding to the colchicine-sensitive site of tubulin, thus inhibiting its polymerization or assembly into microtubules. The loss of the cytoplasmic microtubules leads to impaired uptake of glucose by the larval and adult stages of the susceptible parasites, and depletes their glycogen stores. Degenerative changes in the endoplasmic reticulum, the mitochondria of the germinal layer, and the subsequent release of lysosomes result in decreased production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the energy required for the survival of the helminth."
545,DB00644,"For evaluating the functional capacity and response of the gonadotropes of the anterior pituitary also for evaluating residual gonadotropic function of the pituitary following removal of a pituitary tumor by surgery and/or irradiation.Gonadorelin is another name for gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). It is a synthetic decapeptide prepared using solid phase peptide synthesis. GnRH is responsible for the release of follicle stimulating hormone and leutinizing hormone from the anterior pituitary.Gonadorelin is responsible for the release of follicle stimulating hormone and leutinizing hormone from the anterior pitutitary. In the pituitary GnRH stimulates synthesis and release of FSH and LH, a process that is controlled by the frequency and amplitude of GnRH pulses, as well as the feedback of androgens and estrogens. The pulsatility of GnRH secretion has been seen in all vertebrates, and it is necessary to ensure a correct reproductive function."
546,DB00645,"Used to provide topical anesthesia of accessible mucous membranes prior to examination, endoscopy or instrumentation, or other procedures involving the esophagus, larynx, mouth, pharynx or throat, respiratory tract or trachea, urinary tract, or vagina. Also used to suppress the gag reflex and/or other laryngeal and esophageal reflexes to facilitate dental examination or procedures (including oral surgery), endoscopy, or intubation. Also used for relief of canker sores, cold sores or fever blister.Dyclonine is an oral anaesthetic found in Sucrets, an over the counter throat lozenge. It may also be found in some Cepacol sore throat spray products.Dyclonine is an oral anasthetic. Actions on the cardiovascular system may cause depression of cardiac conduction and excitability and, with some of these agents, peripheral vasodilation.Local anesthetics block both the initiation and conduction of nerve impulses by decreasing the neuronal membrane's permeability to sodium ions."
547,DB00646,"It is indicated topically for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis and other cutaneous candida infections. It is one of the most effective antifungal agents synthesized by bacteria, in this case a strain of _Streptomyces noursei_, and is closely related to , differing only slightly in structure. As it undergoes very little absorption following oral or topical administration, nystatin's efficacy is limited to the treatment/prevention of cutaneous, mucocutaneous, and gastrointestinal fungal infections.Nystatin is an antifungal that is both fungistatic and fungicidal in vitro against a wide variety of yeasts and yeast-like fungi. It exerts its antifungal effects via disruption of the fungal cell membrane. It carries significant systemic toxicity and is currently unavailable in a formula appropriate for systemic use - its efficacy is currently restricted, therefore, to topical, oral, and gastrointestinal infections.Nystatin is a channel-forming ionophore, meaning it exerts its therapeutic effect via formation of a membrane-spanning pore in the fungal plasma membrane."
548,DB00647,"It displays antitussive and local anaesthetic actions. Its general pharmacologic properties are those of the opiates as a group. The analgesic effect of propoxyphene is due to the d-isomer, dextropropoxyphene. It binds to the opiate receptors and leads to a decrease of the perception of pain stimuli. Propoxyphene primarily affects OP3 receptors, which are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as modulators, both positive and negative, of synaptic transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins."
549,DB00648,"Mitotane is indicated for the treatment of inoperable, functional or nonfunctional, adrenocortical carcinoma.Mitotane is an adrenolytic isomer of the insecticide dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD) - itself a metabolite of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) - that inhibits cells of the adrenal cortex and their production of hormones. It has been in use since 1959 for the treatment of inoperable adrenocortical carcinoma and is used off-label for the management of Cushing's syndrome.The administration of mitotane alters the peripheral metabolism of steroids, leading to a reduction in plasma 17-hydroxycorticosteroids and an increase in 6-Î²-hydroxycortisol in addition to normal corticosteroid levels.The mechanism of action of mitotane is unknown, although data are available to suggest that the drug modifies the peripheral metabolism of steroids as well as directly suppressing the adrenal cortex. The specificity of mitotane towards the adrenal cortex may derive from the metabolic transformation to its active form via an enzyme system unique to the adrenal cortex tissue."
550,DB00649,"For the treatment of human immunovirus (HIV) infections.A dideoxynucleoside analog that inhibits reverse transcriptase and has in vitro activity against HIV.Stavudine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) with activity against Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1). Stavudine is phosphorylated to active metabolites that compete for incorporation into viral DNA. They inhibit the HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme competitively and act as a chain terminator of DNA synthesis. The lack of a 3'-OH group in the incorporated nucleoside analogue prevents the formation of the 5' to 3' phosphodiester linkage essential for DNA chain elongation, and therefore, the viral DNA growth is terminated.Stavudine inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) both by competing with the natural substrate dGTP and by its incorporation into viral DNA."
551,DB00650,"Used to diminish the toxicity and counteract the effects of impaired methotrexate elimination and of inadvertent overdosages of folic acid antagonists, and to treat megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency.Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. As folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.Leucovorin is one of several active, chemically reduced derivatives of folic acid. Leucovorin has also been used to enhance the activity of fluorouracil.As leucovorin is a derivative of folic acid, it can be used to increase levels of folic acid under conditions favoring folic acid inhibition (following treatment of folic acid antagonists such as methotrexate)."
552,DB00651,"For relief of acute bronchial asthma and for reversible bronchospasm associated with chronic bronchitis and emphysema.Dyphylline is a theophylline derivative with broncho- and vasodilator properties. It is typically used in the management of asthma, cardiac dyspnea, and bronchitis.Dyphylline, a xanthine derivative, is a bronchodilator used for relief of acute bronchial asthma and for reversible bronchospasm associated with chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Dyphylline is a xanthine derivative with pharmacologic actions similar to theophylline and other members of this class of drugs. Its primary action is that of bronchodilation, but it also exhibits peripheral vasodilatory and other smooth muscle relaxant activity to a lesser degree.The bronchodilatory action of dyphylline, as with other xanthines, is thought to be mediated through competitive inhibition of phosphodiesterase with a resulting increase in cyclic AMP producing relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle as well as antagonism of adenosine receptors."
553,DB00652,"For the relief of moderate to severe pain.The first mixed agonist-antagonist analgesic to be marketed. It is an agonist at the kappa and sigma opioid receptors and has a weak antagonist action at the mu receptor. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1991, p97)Pentazocine is a potent analgesic which when administered orally in a 50 mg dose appears equivalent in analgesic effect to 60 mg (1 grain) of codeine. Onset of significant analgesia usually occurs between 15 and 30 minutes after oral administration, and duration of action is usually three hours or longer. Onset and duration of action and the degree of pain relief are related both to dose and the severity of pretreatment pain."
554,DB00653,"Also indicated for replacement therapy in magnesium deficiency, especially in acute hypomagnesemia accompanied by signs of tetany similar to those of hypocalcemia. It causes direct inhibition of action potentials in myometrial muscle cells. Excitation and contraction are uncoupled, which decreases the frequency and force of contractions. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1992, p1083)Magnesium sulfate is a small colorless crystal used as an anticonvulsant, a cathartic, and an electrolyte replenisher in the treatment of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. It causes direct inhibition of action potentials in myometrial muscle cells."
555,DB00654,"Latanoprost is indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure in patients who have been diagnosed with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. In Canada, latanoprost is also indicated to treat elevated intraocular pressure due to angle-closure glaucoma that has been treated with peripheral iridotomy or laser iridoplasty.Latanoprost is a prodrug analog of prostaglandin F2 alpha that is used to treat elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). Latanoprost is the first topical prostaglandin F2 alpha analog used for glaucoma treatment. A decrease in intraocular pressure has been measured within 3ï¿½? Latanoprost selectively stimulates the prostaglandin F2 alpha receptor and this results in a decreased intraocular pressure (IOP) via the increased outflow of aqueous humor, which is often implicated in cases of elevated intraocular pressure."
556,DB00655,"It is produced in vivo from androstenedione or from testosterone via estradiol. It is produced primarily in the ovaries, placenta, and in peripheral tissues (especially adipose tissue) through conversion of adrostenedione. Estrone is naturally derived from the peripheral conversion of androstenedione by an aromatase enzyme found in adipose tissues and is converted to estradiol in peripheral tissues. Estrone, and estropipate are used to treat abnormalities related to gonadotropin hormone dysfunction, vasomotor symptoms, atrophic vaginitis, and vulvar atrophy associated with menopause, and for the prevention of osteoporosis due to estrogen deficiency.Estrogens enter the cells of responsive tissues (e.g. female organs, breasts, hypothalamus, pituitary) where they interact with estrogen receptors. Hormone-bound estrogen receptors dimerize, translocate to the nucleus of cells and bind to estrogen response elements (ERE) of genes."
557,DB00656,"It has been used off-label for adjunct therapy in alcohol dependence, and off-label to treat anxiety and insomnia. It may also be used off-label to treat symptoms of dementia, Alzheimerâs disease, schizophrenia, eating disorders, and fibromyalgia due to its effects on various neurotransmitter receptors.Trazodone is triazolopyridine derivative from the serotonin receptor antagonists and reuptake inhibitors (SARIs) class of antidepressants. It is used in adults and has been shown to be comparable in efficacy to other drugs such as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin-norepinephrine receptor inhibitor (SNRIs) in the treatment of depression. Patients must be advised to seek immediate medical attention if priapism is suspected.The mechanism of action of trazodone is not fully understood, however, it is known to inhibit the reuptake of serotonin and block both histamine and alpha-1-adrenergic receptors. In addition to acting on serotonin receptors, trazodone has been shown to inhibit serotonin transporters."
558,DB00657,"For the treatment of moderately severe to severe essential hypertension and in uncomplicated cases of malignant hypertensionA nicotinic antagonist that is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and crosses the blood-brain barrier. Mecamylamine has been used as a ganglionic blocker in treating hypertension, but, like most ganglionic blockers, is more often used now as a research tool.Mecamylamine is a potent, oral antihypertensive agent and ganglion blocker, and is a secondary amine. Mecamylamine reduces blood pressure in both normotensive and hypertensive individuals. Although this antihypertensive effect is predominantly orthostatic, the supine blood pressure is also significantly reduced. Mecamylamine crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers.Mecamylamine is a ganglionic blocker which prevents stimulation of postsynaptic receptors by acetylcholine released from presynaptic nerve endings."
559,DB00658,For the control of serum phosphorus in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) on hemodialysis.Sevelamer is a phosphate binding drug used to prevent hyperphosphataemia in patients with chronic renal failure. It is marketed by Genzyme under the trade name Renagel.Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) retain phosphorus and can develop hyperphosphatemia. High serum phosphorus can precipitate serum calcium resulting in ectopic calcification. An increase in parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels is characteristic of patients with chronic renal failure. A decrease in serum phosphorus may decrease serum PTH levels.
560,DB00659,"Acamprosate is indicated for the maintenance of abstinence from alcohol in patients with alcohol dependence who are abstinent at treatment initiation. It is also indicated for the maintenance of alcohol abstinence in patients who have undergone alcohol detoxification. Acamprosate, also known by the brand name Campral, is a drug used for the maintenance of alcohol abstinence. Results of studies in animals suggest acamprosate may interact with glutamate and GABA neurotransmitter systems in the CNS, supporting the hypothesis that acamprosate restores the balance between neuronal excitation and inhibition. Evidence shows that acamprosate directly binds and inhibits GABA B receptors and indirectly affects GABA A receptors."
561,DB00660,"For the treatment of painful peripheral musculoskeletal conditions and spasticity from upper motor neuron syndromes.Metaxalone is a moderate to strong muscle relaxant used in the symptomatic treatment of musculoskeletal pain caused by strains, sprains, and other musculoskeletal conditions. It is marketed by King Pharmaceuticals under the brand name SkelaxinÂ®. Its main mechanism of action is thought to involve general central nervous system depression. Metaxalone is associated with few side effects and is available as a 800 mg scored tablet.Metaxalone is a skeletal muscle relaxant indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomforts associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions. Metaxalone does not directly relax tense skeletal muscles in man.The mechanism of action of metaxalone in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system depression."
562,DB00661,"Verapamil is indicated in the treatment of vasopastic (i.e. Prinzmetal's) angina, unstable angina, and chronic stable angina. It is a member of the non-dihydropyridine class of calcium channel blockers, which includes drugs like  and , but is chemically unrelated to other cardioactive medications. As verapamil is a negative inotropic medication (i.e. it decreases the strength of myocardial contraction), it should not be used in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as the decrease in contractility caused by verapamil may increase the risk of exacerbating these pre-existing conditions.Verapamil inhibits L-type calcium channels by binding to a specific area of their alpha-1 subunit,Cav1.2, which is highly expressed on L-type calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle and myocardial tissue where these channels are responsible for the control of peripheral vascular resistance and heart contractility. Inhibition of calcium influx prevents the contraction of vascular smooth muscle, causing relaxation/dilation of blood vessels throughout the peripheral circulation - this lowers systemic vascular resistance (i.e. afterload) and thus blood pressure. Verapamil's mechanism of action in the treatment of cluster headaches is unclear, but is thought to result from an effect on other calcium channels (e.g. N-, P-, Q-, or T-type)."
563,DB00662,"For the treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting and for nausea associated with gastroenteritis.Trimethobenzamide is a novel antiemetic which prevents nausea and vomiting in humans. Its actions are unclear but most likely involves the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ). In dogs pretreated with trimethobenzamide HCl, the emetic response to apomorphine is inhibited, while little or no protection is afforded against emesis induced by intragastric copper sulfate.Trimethobenzamide is a novel antiemetic which prevents nausea and vomiting in humans. Its actions are unclear but most likely involves the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ). In dogs pretreated with trimethobenzamide HCl, the emetic response to apomorphine is inhibited, while little or no protection is afforded against emesis induced by intragastric copper sulfate.The mechanism of action of trimethobenzamide as determined in animals is obscure, but may involve the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), an area in the medulla oblongata through which emetic impulses are conveyed to the vomiting center; direct impulses to the vomiting center apparently are not similarly inhibited."
564,DB00663,"As it is a privalate salt, its anti-inflammatory action is concentrated at the site of application. This local effect on diseased areas results in a prompt decrease in inflammation, exudation and itching.Flumethasone pivalate is a moderately potent difluorinated corticosteroid ester with anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive properties. As it is a privalate salt, its anti-inflammatory action is concentrated at the site of application. This complex binds to the nucleus causing a variety of genetic activation and repressions. The antiinflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes."
565,DB00664,"The sulfonamides are synthetic bacteriostatic antibiotics with a wide spectrum against most gram-positive and many gram-negative organisms. Sulfonamides inhibit multiplication of bacteria by acting as competitive inhibitors of p-aminobenzoic acid in the folic acid metabolism cycle. Bacterial sensitivity is the same for the various sulfonamides, and resistance to one sulfonamide indicates resistance to all. Their antibacterial action is inhibited by pus.Sulfametopyrazine is a competitive inhibitor of the bacterial  enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase. The inhibited reaction is necessary in these organisms for the synthesis of folic acid."
566,DB00665,"For use in combination with surgical castration for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer involving distant lymph nodes, bone, or visceral organs (Stage D2).Nilutamide is an antineoplastic hormonal agent primarily used in the treatment of prostate cancer. Nilutamide is a pure, nonsteroidal anti-androgen with affinity for androgen receptors (but not for progestogen, estrogen, or glucocorticoid receptors). Consequently, Nilutamide blocks the action of androgens of adrenal and testicular origin that stimulate the growth of normal and malignant prostatic tissue. To date, antiandrogen monotherapy has not consistently been shown to be equivalent to castration.Nilutamide is an antineoplastic hormonal agent primarily used in the treatment of prostate cancer. The relative binding affinity of nilutamide at the androgen receptor is less than that of bicalutamide, but similar to that of hydroxuflutamide.Nilutamide competes with androgen for the binding of androgen receptors, consequently blocking the action of androgens of adrenal and testicular origin that stimulate the growth of normal and malignant prostatic tissue."
567,DB00666,"After nafarelin therapy is discontinued, pituitary and ovarian function normalize and estradiol serum concentrations increase to pretreatment levels. Recurrences of endometriosis are frequent after cessation of any hormonal therapy, or surgery that leaves the ovaries and/or uterus intact.Like GnRH, initial or intermittent administration of nafarelin stimulates release of the gonadotropins luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the pituitary gland, which in turn transiently increases production of estradiol in females and testosterone in both sexes. However, with continuous daily administration, nafarelin continuously occupies the GnRH receptor, leading to a reversible down-regulation of the GnRH receptors in the pituitary gland and desensitization of the pituitary gonadotropes. Estrogen stimulates the growth of endometrium. In children with central precocious puberty receiving nafarelin, serum LH, testosterone, and estradiol concentrations return to prepubertal levels."
568,DB00668,"Epinephrine injection is indicated in the emergency treatment of type I allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. It is also used to increase mean arterial blood pressure in adult patients with hypotension associated with septic shock. It is also used for the maintenance of mydriasis during intraocular surgery .Epinephrine, also known as _adrenaline_, is a hormone and neurotransmitter and produced by the adrenal glands that can also be used as a drug due to its various important functions. Though it has long been used in the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions, epinephrine in the auto-injector form (EpiPen) has been available since 1987 in the USA. Epinephrine also alleviates pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema and may be helpful in relieving gastrointestinal and genitourinary symptoms associated with anaphylaxis because of its relaxing effects on the smooth muscle of the stomach, intestine, uterus, and urinary bladder .Epinephrine acts on alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors."
569,DB00669,"One of the subcutaneous formulations of sumatriptan is also indicated to treat cluster headaches in adults, while the other subcutaneous formulation is not.Sumatriptan is a serotonin receptor agonist commonly used to treat migraines and sometimes cluster headaches. Sumatriptan was granted FDA approval on 28 December 1992.Sumatriptan constricts cranial blood vessels and prevents the release of vasoactive peptides. The dose of sumatriptan varies widely by route of administration and in most cases, no more than 2 doses should be given daily. This agonism leads to constriction of cranial blood vessels and inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory neuropeptides. Sumatriptan decreases carotid arterial blood flow, but increases blood flow velocity in the internal carotid artery and middle cerebral artery."
570,DB00670,"For the treatment of peptic ulcer, gastric ulcer, and duodenal ulcer.An antimuscarinic agent that inhibits gastric secretion at lower doses than are required to affect gastrointestinal motility, salivary, central nervous system, cardiovascular, ocular, and urinary function. It also potentiates the effect of other antiulcer agents such as cimetidine and ranitidine. It is generally well tolerated by patients.Pirenzepine belongs to a group of medications called antispasmodics/anticholinergics.

Cephalosporins are beta-lactam antibiotics and can be used to treat gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections which include conditions such as skin infections, resistant bacteria, and meningitis. Also like other cephalosporins, cefixime is stable when in the presence of certain beta-lactamase enzymes, which means certain organisms resistant to penicillins and some cephalosporins due to the presence of beta-lactamases could be susceptible to cefixime. In general, inhibition of one or more essential PBPs results in impaired cell wall homeostasis, loss of cell integrity, and is ultimately bactericidal. Cefixime is a cephalosporin and cephalosporins work by using their beta-lactam rings to inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to the penicillin-binding proteins transpeptidases on bacteria."
572,DB00672,"Chlorpropamide is an oral antihyperglycemic agent used for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Sulfonylureas increase both basal insulin secretion and meal-stimulated insulin release. Medications in this class differ in their dose, rate of absorption, duration of action, route of elimination and binding site on their target pancreatic Î² cell receptor. Sulfonylureas also increase peripheral glucose utilization, decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis and may increase the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors. Due to their mechanism of action, sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia and require consistent food intake to decrease this risk."

Animal and human Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies with Aprepitant have shown that it crosses the blood brain barrier and occupies brain NK1 receptors."
574,DB00674,"Galantamine is indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimerâs type.Galantamine is a tertiary alkaloid and reversible, competitive inhibitor of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme, which is a widely studied therapeutic target used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Following the discovery of its AChE-inhibiting properties, the cognitive effects of galantamine were studied in a wide variety of psychiatric disorders such as mild cognitive impairment, cognitive impairment in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and autism; however, re-development of the drug for Alzheimerâs disease did not commence until the early 1990s due to difficulties in extraction and synthesis. Galantamine blocks the breakdown of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft, thereby increasing acetylcholine neurotransmission. Galantamine exhibited therapeutic efficacy in studies of vascular dementia and Alzheimerâs disease with cerebrovascular disease. Acetylcholinesterase is secreted by cholinergic neurons to rapidly hydrolyze ACh at the synaptic cleft to release acetate and choline."

581,DB00682,"In patients with deep vein thrombosis or atrial fibrillation there is an increased risk of thrombus formation due to the reduced movement of blood. Antocoagulation appears to mediate warfarin-related nephropathy, a seemingly spontaneous kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease associated with warfarin therapy. This is attributable to half lives of the clotting factors impacted by inhibition of vitamin K recycling. Thrombi which form in this time period can occlude arterioles in various locations, blocking blood flow and causing tissue necrosis due to ischemia.Warfarin is a  antagonist which acts to inhibit the production of vitamin K by vitamin K epoxide reductase. The reduced form of vitamin K, vitamin KH2 is a cofactor used in the Î³-carboxylation of coagulation factors VII, IX, X, and thrombin."
582,DB00683,"It can also be indicated for induction of general anesthesia, before administration of other anesthetic agents or as a component of intravenous supplementation of nitrous oxide and oxygen for a balanced anesthesia.

586,DB00687,"Fludrocortisone is indicated as partial replacement therapy for primary or secondary adrenocortical insufficiency in Addison's disease. It is also indicated for the treatment of salt-losing androgenital syndrome.Fludrocortisone is a synthetic mineralocorticoid used in conjunction with  to replace missing endogenous corticosteroids in patients with adrenal insufficiency. As its effects are exerted at the transcriptional level, a single dose of fludrocortisone may work over the course of 1-2 days despite a relatively short plasma half-life. Like other systemic corticosteroids, fludrocortisone may mask signs of infection by depressing the normal immune response - infections occurring during fludrocortisone therapy should be promptly treated with appropriate antimicrobial therapy.The main endogenous mineralocorticoid, aldosterone, is produced in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex - it acts on mineralocorticoid receptors in the kidneys to increase sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, which in turn helps to regulate plasma electrolyte composition and blood pressure. Fludrocortisone binding to mineralocorticoid receptors causes alterations to DNA transcription and translation of proteins that result in an increased density of sodium channels on the apical side of renal tubule cells and an increased density of Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase on the basolateral side."
587,DB00688,"Other off-label uses of this drug include lupus-associated nephritis and dermatitis in children.Mycophenolate mofetil, also known as MMF or CellCept, is a prodrug of mycophenolic acid, and classified as a reversible inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH). In addition to the above uses, mycophenolate mofetil has also been studied for the treatment of nephritis and other complications of autoimmune diseases. It demonstrates an increased bioavailability, a higher efficacy, and reduced gastrointestinal effects when compared to MPA.Mycophenolate mofetil is a prodrug of mycophenolic acid (MPA). The active form of mycophenolate, MPA, prevents the proliferation of immune cells and the formation of antibodies that cause transplant rejection. IMPDH normally transforms inosine monophosphate (IMP) to xanthine monophosphate (XMP), a metabolite contributing to the production of guanosine triphosphate (GTP)."
588,DB00689,For treatment of severe infections caused by susceptible bacteria.A cephalorsporin antibiotic that is no longer commonly used.Cephaloglycin is an antibiotic related to cephalosporin but no longer in common use.

It acts by inhibiting cellular reproduction through interference with DNA replication although it may contribute to the induction of cell death by increasing oxidative stress through the generation of reactive oxygen species and free radicals. As an antineoplastic agent, daunorubicin carries significant toxicities including cytopenias, hepatotoxicity, and extravasation reactions. Like other anthracyclines, daunorubicin also exhibits cardiotoxicity in proportion with the cumulative dose received over time.Daunorubicin has antimitotic and cytotoxic activity through a number of proposed mechanisms of action: Daunorubicin forms complexes with DNA by intercalation between base pairs, and it inhibits topoisomerase II activity by stabilizing the DNA-topoisomerase II complex, preventing the religation portion of the ligation-religation reaction that topoisomerase II catalyzes."
594,DB00695,"Furosemide is indicated for the treatment of edema associated with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver, and renal disease, including the nephrotic syndrome, in adults and pediatric patients. This drug formulation is not indicated for emergency situations or in patients with acute pulmonary edema.Furosemide is a potent loop diuretic that acts on the kidneys to ultimately increase water loss from the body.

598,DB00699,"For the treatment of senile dementia, migraines of vascular origin, transient ischemia, platelet hyper-aggregability, and macular degeneration.An ergot derivative that has been used as a cerebral vasodilator and in peripheral vascular disease. It has been suggested to ameliorate cognitive deficits in cerebrovascular disease.Nicergoline is a potent vasodilator (improves brain blood flow). On the cerebral level it prompts a lowering of vascular resistance, an increase in arterial flow and stimulates the use of oxygen and glucose. Nicergoline also improves blood circulation in the lungs and limbs and has been shown to inhibit blood platelet aggregation.Nicergoline acts by inhibiting the postsynaptic alpha(1)-adrenoceptors on vascular smooth muscle. This inhibits the vasoconstrictor effect of circulating and locally released catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine), resulting in peripheral vasodilation."
599,DB00700,"The resulting increased plasma renin activity and aldosterone circulating levels do not overcome the effects of eplerenone. Eplerenone selectively binds to recombinant human mineralocorticoid receptors relative to its binding to recombinant human glucocorticoid, progesterone and androgen receptors.Eplerenone, an aldosterone receptor antagonist similar to spironolactone, has been shown to produce sustained increases in plasma renin and serum aldosterone, consistent with inhibition of the negative regulatory feedback of aldosterone on renin secretion. The resulting increased plasma renin activity and aldosterone circulating levels do not overcome the effects of eplerenone. Aldosterone synthesis, which occurs primarily in the adrenal gland, is modulated by multiple factors, including angiotensin II and non-RAAS mediators such as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and potassium. Aldosterone binds to mineralocorticoid receptors in both epithelial (e.g., kidney) and nonepithelial (e.g., heart, blood vessels, and brain) tissues and increases blood pressure through induction of sodium reabsorption and possibly other mechanisms."

607,DB00709,"For the treatment of HIV infection and chronic hepatitis B (HBV).A reverse transcriptase inhibitor and zalcitabine analog in which a sulfur atom replaces the 3&#39; carbon of the pentose ring. When phosphorylated, lamivudine can form active metabolites that compete for incorporation into viral DNA. Via DNA incorporation, lamivudine metabolites competitively inhibit the activity of the HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme and act as a chain terminator of DNA synthesis. Due to the lack of a 3'-OH group, incorporated nucleoside analogues prevent the formation of a 5' to 3' phosphodiester linkage that is essential for DNA chain elongation. This nucleoside analogue is incorporated into viral DNA by HIV reverse transcriptase and HBV polymerase, resulting in DNA chain termination."

It is a synthetic organic compound which is highly specific for several parasites and does not contain any toxic metallic elements. The mechanism of action of diethylcarbamazine is thought to involve sensitizing the microfilariae to phagocytosis. One study showed that diethylcarbamazine's activity against Brugia malayi microfilariae is dependent on inducible nitric-oxide synthase and the cyclooxygenase pathway. It confirmed the important role of the arachidonic acid metabolic pathway in diethylcarbamazine's mechanism of action in vivoand showes that in addition to its effects on the 5-lipoxygenase pathway, it targets the cyclooxygenase pathway and COX-1."
610,DB00712,"It may also be used to treat pain associated with dysmenorrhea and mild to moderate pain accompanied by inflammation (e.g. bursitis, tendonitis, soft tissue trauma). Flurbiprofen, a propionic acid derivative, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAIA) with antipyretic and analgesic activity. Oral formulations of flurbiprofen may be used for the symptomatic treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and anklylosing spondylitis. The S-enantiomer appears to possess most of the anti-inflammatory, while both enantiomers may possess analgesic activity.Similar to other NSAIAs, the anti-inflammatory effect of flurbiprofen occurs via reversible inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX), the enzyme responsible for the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin G2 (PGG2) and PGG2 to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) in the prostaglandin synthesis pathway. Flurbiprofen is a non-selective COX inhibitor and inhibits the activity of both COX-1 and -2."
611,DB00713,"Used in the treatment of resistant staphylococci infections.An antibiotic similar to  used in resistant staphylococci infections.Oxacillin is a penicillin beta-lactam antibiotic used in the treatment of bacterial infections caused by susceptible, usually gram-positive, organisms. The name ""penicillin"" can either refer to several variants of penicillin available, or to the group of antibiotics derived from the penicillins. Oxacillin has in vitro activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The bactericidal activity of Oxacillin results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis and is mediated through Oxacillin binding to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). Oxacillin is stable against hydrolysis by a variety of beta-lactamases, including penicillinases, and cephalosporinases and extended spectrum beta-lactamases.By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, Oxacillin inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis."

Apomorphine was granted FDA approval on 20 April 2004.Apomorphine is a dopaminergic agonist that may stimulate regions of the brain involved in motor control. Given the incidence of nausea and vomiting in patients taking apomorphine, treatment with  may be recommended prior to or during therapy."
613,DB00715,"A unique feature of this drug is that it is highly potent and selective in its inhibition of serotonin reuptake and has little effect on other neurotransmitters. The controlled release formulation was designed to decrease the likelihood of nausea that is sometimes associated with paroxetine.Paroxetine treats the symptoms of depression, various anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and the vasomotor symptoms of menopause via the inhibition of serotonin reuptake. This drug has been demonstrated to be a stronger inhibitor of serotonin reuptake than other members of the same drug class, including , , and . The mechanism of action of paroxetine in relieving the vasomotor symptoms of menopause is unknown, according to the Brisdelle prescribing information, but may occur due to its effects on thermoregulation. In rats, paroxetine activates 5-HT1A receptors when it is first administered, inhibiting the stimulation of the  5-HT neurons and subsequent release of serotonin at the synaptic cleft."
614,DB00716,"For the treatment of mild to moderate asthmaA pyranoquinolone derivative that inhibits activation of inflammatory cells which are associated with asthma, including eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, mast cells, monocytes, and platelets.Nedocromil is a anti-inflammatory agent and can be administered directly to the bronchial mucosa. Nedocromil inhibits activation and release of inflammatory mediators such as histamine, prostaglandin D2 and leukotrienes c4 from different types of cells in the lumen and mucosa of the bronchial tree. These mediators are derived from arachidonic acid metabolism through the lipoxygenase and cyclo-oxygenase pathways. The result is inhibition of bradykinin-induced bronchoconstriction. Nedocromil does not posess any bronchodilator, antihistamine, or corticosteroid activity."
615,DB00717,"When applied via transdermal patch, the combination of norethisterone and estradiol is indicated for the treatment of hypoestrogenism, vulvovaginal atrophy, and moderate-severe vasomotor symptoms.Norethisterone, also known as norethindrone, is a synthetic progestational hormone belonging to the 19-nortestosterone-derived class of progestins. It is further classified as a second-generation progestin, along with  and its derivatives, and is the active form of several other progestins including  and .L9527,L10301,L10304,L10307] First derived in 1951 in Mexico City, norethisterone was originally intended for use as a remedy for irregular menstruation and endometriosis, and was not marketed for use as an oral contraceptive until 1962.Norethisterone is a synthetic oral progestin used for contraception or to treat other hormone-related conditions such as menopausal symptoms and endometriosis. As a synthetic progestin, norethisterone acts similarly to endogenous progesterone but with a much higher potency - it acts at the pelvic level to alter cervical and endometrial function, as well as via the inhibition of pituitary hormones that play a role in follicular maturation and ovulation.L9527]On a molecular level, progestins like norethisterone exert their effects on target cells via binding to progesterone receptors that result in downstream changes to target genes. Contraceptive efficacy is derived mainly from changes to the cervical mucus, wherein norethisterone increases the cell content and viscosity of the mucous to impede sperm transport and migration. The addition of a progestin to a hormone replacement therapy in this population protects against this endometrial hyperplasia and, therefore, lowers the risk associated with the use of hormone replacement therapies."

617,DB00719,"For the relief of the symptoms of upper respiratory mucosal congestion in perennial and allergic rhinitis, and for the relief of nasal congestion and eustachian t.b. congestion.Antihistamines such as azatadine appear to compete with histamine for histamine H1- receptor sites on effector cells. The antihistamines antagonize those pharmacological effects of histamine which are mediated through activation of H1- receptor sites and thereby reduce the intensity of allergic reactions and tissue injury response involving histamine release.Azatadine is an antihistamine, related to cyproheptadine, with anti-serotonin, anticholinergic (drying), and sedative effects. Azatadine is in the same class of drugs as chlorpromazine (Thorazine) and trifluoperazine (Stelazine); however, unlike the other drugs in this class, azatadine is not used clinically as an anti-psychotic. Antihistamines antagonize the vasodilator effect of endogenously released histamine, especially in small vessels, and mitigate the effect of histamine which results in increased capillary permeability and edema formation."

624,DB00726,"For the treatment of depression and depression accompanied by anxiety, agitation or sleep disturbanceTricyclic antidepressant similar to imipramine, but with more antihistaminic and sedative properties.Trimipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant. It was thought that tricyclic antidepressants work by inhibiting the re-uptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin by nerve cells. However, this response occurs immediately, yet mood does not lift for around two weeks. It is now thought that changes occur in receptor sensitivity in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Presynaptic receptors are affected: a1 and b1 receptors are sensitized, a2 receptors are desensitised (leading to increased noradrenaline production)."

Nitroglycerin is used in a variety of different conditions, including angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease, peri-operative hypertension, congestive heart failure, and chronic anal fissure. cGMP is an endogenous vasodilator of vascular smooth muscle: it causes protein kinase-dependent phosphorylation and activates downstream cascades that promote relaxation and increased blood flow in veins, arteries and cardiac tissue."
626,DB00728,"Introduced in 1994, rocuronium has rapid onset, and intermediate duration of action. is a Î³-cyclodextrin derivative that has been introduced as a novel agent to reverse the action of rocuronium.Neuromuscular blocking agents are drugs that cause skeletal muscle relaxation primarily by causing a decreased response to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) at the myoneural (neuromuscular) junction of skeletal muscle. Neuromuscular agents are classified as depolarizing or nondepolarizing. Rocuronium is a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent with a rapid to intermediate onset depending on dose and intermediate duration. The binding of vecuronium decreases the opportunity for acetylcholine to bind to the nicotinic receptor at the postjunctional membrane of the myoneural junction."
627,DB00730,"For the treatment of strongyloidiasis (threadworm), cutaneous larva migrans (creeping eruption), visceral larva migrans, and trichinosis.2-Substituted benzimidazole first introduced in 1962. It is active against a variety of nematodes and is the drug of choice for strongyloidiasis. It has CNS side effects and hepatototoxic potential. (From Smith and Reynard, Textbook of Pharmacology, 1992, p919)Thiabendazole is a fungicide and parasiticide. Thiabendazole is also a chelating agent, which means that it is used medicinally to bind metals in cases of metal poisoning, such as lead poisoning, mercury poisoning or antimony poisoning."
628,DB00731,"It belongs to the meglitinide class of short-acting insulin secretagogues, which act by binding to Î² cells of the pancreas to stimulate insulin release. Membrane potential is regulated through an inverse relationship between the activity of cell membrane ATP-sensitive potassium channels (ABCC8) and extracellular glucose concentrations. High glucose concentrations cause ATP-sensitive potassium channels to close resulting in membrane depolarization and opening of L-type calcium channels. Nateglinide activity is dependent on the presence functioning Î² cells and glucose. As such, nateglinide is more effective at reducing postprandial blood glucose levels than fasting blood glucose levels and requires a longer duration of therapy (approximately one month) before decreases in fasting blood glucose are observed."
629,DB00732,"For use, as an adjunct to general anesthesia, to facilitate endotracheal intubation and to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation.A non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent with short duration of action. Its lack of significant cardiovascular effects and its lack of dependence on good kidney function for elimination provide clinical advantage over alternate non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents.Atracurium is a nondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxant. Atracurium can be used most advantageously if muscle twitch response to peripheral nerve stimulation is monitored to assess degree of muscle relaxation. The duration of neuromuscular block produced by Atracurium is approximately one third to one half the duration of block by d-tubocurarine, metocurine, and pancuronium at initially equipotent doses. As with other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers, the time to onset of paralysis decreases and the duration of maximum effect increases with increasing doses of Atracurium."
630,DB00733,"For the treatment of poisoning due to those pesticides and chemicals of the organophosphate class which have anticholinesterase activity and in the control of overdosage by anticholinesterase drugs used in the treatment of myasthenia gravis.Pralidoxime is an antidote to organophosphate pesticides and chemicals. Organophosphates bind to the esteratic site of acetylcholinesterase, which results initially in reversible inactivation of the enzyme. If given within 24 hours,after organophosphate exposure, pralidoxime reactivates the enzyme cholinesterase by cleaving the phosphate-ester bond formed between the organophosphate and acetylcholinesterase.Pralidoxime is to reactivate cholinesterase (mainly outside of the central nervous system) which has been inactivated by phosphorylation due to an organophosphate pesticide or related compound. The destruction of accumulated acetylcholine can then proceed, and neuromuscular junctions will again function normally. Because pralidoxime is less effective in relieving depression of the respiratory center, atropine is always required concomitantly to block the effect of accumulated acetylcholine at this site."
631,DB00734,"Schizophrenia and various mood disorders are thought to be caused by an excess of dopaminergic D2 and serotonergic 5-HT2A activity, resulting in overactivity of central mesolimbic pathways and mesocortical pathways, respectively. Risperidone binds with a very high affinity to 5-HT2A receptors, approximately 10-20 fold greater than the drug's binding affinity to D2 receptors, and carries lesser activity at several off-targets which may responsible for some of its undesirable effects.The primary action of risperidone is to decrease dopaminergic and serotonergic pathway activity in the brain, therefore decreasing symptoms of schizophrenia and mood disorders. Risperidone has a high binding affinity for serotonergic 5-HT2A receptors when compared to dopaminergic D2 receptors in the brain. A reduction in extrapyramidal symptoms with risperidone, when compared to its predecessors, is likely a result of its moderate affinity for dopaminergic D2 receptors.Though its precise mechanism of action is not fully understood, current focus is on the ability of risperidone to inhibit the D2 dopaminergic receptors and 5-HT2A serotonergic receptors in the brain. Rapid dissociation of risperidone from the D2 receptors contributes to decreased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), which occur with permanent and high occupancy blockade of D2 dopaminergic receptors."

It differs from other GBCAs due to the benzene ring that confers weak protein binding, thus leading to an increased R1 and R2 relaxivity. As gadobenate dimeglumine is specifically taken up by hepatocytes and excreted through the biliary system, it is a useful contrast agent for liver MRI. Gadobenate dimeglumine was approved by the FDA in November 2004 under the brand name MultiHance.Unlike other paramagnetic contrast agents, gadobenate dimeglumine demonstrates weak and transient interactions with serum proteins that cause slowing in the molecular tumbling dynamics, resulting in strong increases in relaxivity in solutions containing serum  proteins. Uptake of gadobenate dimeglumine into hepatocytes has been demonstrated.Gadobenate dimeglumine is a paramagnetic agent and, as such, develops a magnetic moment when placed in a magnetic field."

Narcolepsy is caused by dysfunction of a family of wakefulness-promoting and sleep-suppressing peptides, the orexins, whose neurons are activated by modafinil. Modafinil activates glutamatergic circuits while inhibiting GABA.Modafinil is a stimulant drug marketed as a 'wakefulness promoting agent' and is one of the stimulants used in the treatment of narcolepsy. Also, it has been used in the treatment of hypersomnia, a disorder in which patients lack the capacity for meaningful sleep and may require ten or more hours per day. Recent studies have have found that modafinil may help recovering cocaine addicts fight their addiction.The exact mechanism of action is unclear, although in vitro studies have shown it to inhibit the reuptake of dopamine by binding to the dopamine reuptake pump, and lead to an increase in extracellular dopamine."
642,DB00746,"Used to treat acute iron or aluminum toxicity (an excess of aluminum in the body) in certain patients. It forms iron complexes and is used as a chelating agent, particularly in the mesylate form.Deferoxamine, otherwise known as desferrioxamine or desferal, is a chelating agent used to remove excess iron or aluminum from the body. By removing excess iron or aluminum, the agent reduces the damage done to various organs and tissues, such as the liver.Deferoxamine works in treating iron toxicity by binding trivalent (ferric) iron (for which it has a strong affinity), forming ferrioxamine, a stable complex which is eliminated via the kidneys. 100 mg of deferoxamine is capable of binding approximately 8.5 mg of trivalent (ferric) iron. The formation of aluminoxamine increases blood concentrations of aluminum, resulting in an increased concentration gradient between the blood and dialysate, boosting the removal of aluminum during dialysis."
643,DB00747,"As an acetylcholine analogue, scopolamine can antagonize muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) in the central nervous system and throughout the body, inducing several therapeutic and adverse effects related to alteration of parasympathetic nervous system and cholinergic signalling. Due to its dose-dependent adverse effects, scopolamine was the first drug to be offered commercially as a transdermal delivery system, Scopoderm TTSÂ®, in 1981. Scopolamine was first approved by the FDA on December 31, 1979, and is currently available as both oral tablets and a transdermal delivery system.Scopolamine is an anticholinergic belladonna alkaloid that, through competitive inhibition of muscarinic receptors, affects parasympathetic nervous system function and acts on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. Patients with gastrointestinal or urinary disorders should be monitored frequently for impairments, and scopolamine should be discontinued if these develop. Due to its gastrointestinal effects, scopolamine can interfere with gastric secretion testing and should be discontinued at least 10 days before performing the test."
644,DB00748,"Also for the relief of allergic reactions to blood or plasma, and the symptomatic management of mild, uncomplicated allergic skin manifestations of urticaria and angioedema.Carbinoxamine is a first generation antihistamine that competes with free histamine for binding at HA-receptor sites. This antagonizes the effects of histamine on HA-receptors, leading to a reduction of the negative symptoms brought on by histamine HA-receptor binding. In addition to the usual allergic symptoms, the drug also treats irritant cough and nausea, vomiting, and vertigo associated with motion sickness. It also is used commonly to treat drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms as well as to treat mild cases of Parkinson's disease. Ethanolamine derivatives have greater anticholinergic activity than do other antihistamines, which probably accounts for the antidyskinetic action of carbinoxamine.Carbinoxamine competes with free histamine for binding at HA-receptor sites."
645,DB00749,"For acute and long-term management of signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as for the management of pain.Etodolac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties. The therapeutic effects of etodolac are achieved via inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandins involved in fever, pain, swelling and inflammation. As with other NSAIDs, the S-form has been shown to be active while the R-form is inactive. Both enantiomers are stable and there is no evidence of R- to S- conversion _in vivo_.Similar to other NSAIDs, the anti-inflammatory effects of etodolac result from inhibition of the enzyme cycooxygenase (COX). Etodolac binds to the upper portion of the COX enzyme active site and prevents its substrate, arachidonic acid, from entering the active site."

Currently, it is used most often for infiltration anesthesia in dentistry. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1992, p165)Prilocaine binds to the intracellular surface of sodium channels which blocks the subsequent influx of sodium into the cell. Action potential propagation and never function is, therefore, prevented. This block is reversible and when the drug diffuses away from the cell, sodium channel function is restored and nerve propagation returns.Prilocaine acts on sodium channels on the neuronal cell membrane, limiting the spread of seizure activity and reducing seizure propagation."
647,DB00751,"For the prevention of itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis.Epinastine is used for the prevention of itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis. It has a multi-action effect that inhibits the allergic response in 3 ways: 1. stabilizes mast cells by preventing mast cell degranulation to control the allergic response, 2. prevents histamine binding to both the H1- and H2-receptors to stop itching and provide lasting protection, and 3. prevents the release of proinflammatory chemical mediators from the blood vessel to halt progression of the allergic response.Epinastine is an antihistamine and an inhibitor of histamine release from the mast cell for topical administration to the eyes. Epinastine is indicated for the prevention of itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis. Epinastine is selective for the histamine H1-receptor and has affinity for the histamine H2 receptor. Epinastine also possesses affinity for the a1-, a2-, and 5-HT2 -receptors."
648,DB00752,"This monoamine oxidase inhibitor is effective in the treatment of major depression, dysthymic disorder, and atypical depression. Tranylcypromine is a non-hydrazine monoamine oxidase inhibitor with a rapid onset of activity. MAO is an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative deamination of a number of amines, including serotonin, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine. MAO A inhibition is thought to be more relevant to antidepressant activity than MAO B inhibition. Since depression is associated with low levels of monoamines, the inhibition of MAO serves to ease depressive symptoms, as this results in an increase in the concentrations of these amines within the CNS."
649,DB00753,"For induction and maintenance of general anesthesia.A stable, non-explosive inhalation anesthetic, relatively free from significant side effects.Isoflurane is a general inhalation anesthetic used for induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. It induces muscle relaxation and reduces pains sensitivity by altering tissue excitability. It does so by decreasing the extent of gap junction mediated cell-cell coupling and altering the activity of the channels that underlie the action potential.Isoflurane induces a reduction in junctional conductance by decreasing gap junction channel opening times and increasing gap junction channel closing times. Isoflurane also activates calcium dependent ATPase in the sarcoplasmic reticulum by increasing the fluidity of the lipid membrane. Also appears to bind the D subunit of ATP synthase and NADH dehydogenase."
650,DB00754,"The mechanism of action is probably very similar to that of phenytoin. The latter drug appears to stabilize rather than to raise the normal seizure threshold, and to prevent the spread of seizure activity rather than to abolish the primary focus of seizure discharges. The mechanism of action is probably very similar to that of phenytoin. The latter drug appears to stabilize rather than to raise the normal seizure threshold, and to prevent the spread of seizure activity rather than to abolish the primary focus of seizure discharges.The mechanism of action is probably very similar to that of phenytoin.

651,DB00755,"It has been used in dermatology for many years to treat various skin conditions ranging from acne to wrinkles  and activates nuclear receptors to regulate epithelial cell growth and differentiation. Tretinoin is given orally to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia  and topically to treat skin conditions such as acne.Tretinoin is a vitamin A derivative that promotes cell production, proliferation, and differentiation. When used topically, tretinoin regulates epidermal cell turnover and collagen production. In patients with APL, tretinoin promoted the initial maturation of the primitive promyelocytes derived from the leukemic clone, followed by a repopulation of the bone marrow and peripheral blood by normal, polyclonal hematopoietic cells in patients achieving complete remission.The exact mechanism of action of tretinoin in skin conditions and acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) has not been fully elucidated; however, several proposed mechanisms exist. Tretinoin may reduce epidermal melanin and pigmentation by increasing keratinocyte turnover and reducing tyrosinase activity."
652,DB00757,"For the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including initial and repeat courses of chemotherapy. Also used for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting. This drug is not shown to have activity at other known serotonin receptors, and has low affinity for dopamine receptors.Dolasetron is a highly specific and selective serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, not shown to have activity at other known serotonin receptors and with low affinity for dopamine receptors. The serotonin then stimulates the vagal and splanchnic nerve receptors that project to the medullary vomiting center, as well as the 5-HT3 receptors in the area postrema, thus initiating the vomiting reflex, causing nausea and vomiting.Dolasetron is a selective serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. The antiemetic activity of the drug is brought about through the inhibition of 5-HT3 receptors present both centrally (medullary chemoreceptor zone) and peripherally (GI tract)."
653,DB00758,"Clopidogrel is indicated to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction for patients with non-ST elevated acute coronary syndrome (ACS), patients with ST-elevated myocardial infarction, and in recent MI, stroke, or established peripheral arterial disease,Clopidogrel is a prodrug of a platelet inhibitor used to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. Clopidogrel is indicated to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction for patients with non-ST elevated acute coronary syndrome (ACS), patients with ST-elevated myocardial infarction, and in recent MI, stroke, or established peripheral arterial disease,    It has been shown to be superior to  in reducing cardiovascular outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease and provides additional benefit to patients with acute coronary syndromes already taking aspirin. It has a long duration of action as it is taken once daily and a large therapeutic window as it is given in doses of 75-300mg daily.Clopidogrel is activated via a 2 steps reaction to an active thiol-containing metabolite. This active form is a platelet inhibitor that irreversibly binds to P2Y12 ADP receptors on platelets. This binding prevents ADP binding to P2Y12 receptors, activation of the glycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa complex, and platelet aggregation."
654,DB00759,May also be used to treat acne. Tetracycline may be an alternative drug for people who are allergic to penicillin.Tetracycline is a broad spectrum polyketide antibiotic produced by the Streptomyces genus of Actinobacteria. It exerts a bacteriostatic effect on bacteria by binding reversible to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit and blocking incoming aminoacyl tRNA from binding to the ribosome acceptor site. It also binds to some extent to the bacterial 50S ribosomal subunit and may alter the cytoplasmic membrane causing intracellular components to leak from bacterial cells. It also binds to some extent to the 50S ribosomal subunit.

656,DB00761,"The normal adult plasma concentration is 3.5 to 5 mEq per liter. The usual dietary intake of potassium is 50 to 100 mEq per day. If potassium depletion associated with metabolic alkalosis cannot be managed by correcting the fundamental cause of the deficiency, e.g., where the patient requires long-term diuretic therapy, supplemental potassium in the form of high potassium food or potassium chloride may be able to restore normal potassium levels. In rare circumstances (e.g., patients with renal tubular acidosis) potassium depletion may be associated with metabolic acidosis and hyperchloremia. In such patients, potassium replacement should be accomplished with potassium salts other than the chloride, such as potassium bicarbonate, potassium citrate, potassium acetate, or potassium gluconate.Supplemental potassium in the form of high potassium food or potassium chloride may be able to restore normal potassium levels."
657,DB00762,"It is a derivative of camptothecin that inhibits the action of topoisomerase I. Irinotecan prevents religation of the DNA strand by binding to topoisomerase I-DNA complex, and causes double-strand DNA breakage and cell death. Camptothecins interact specifically with topoisomerase I, an enzyme in the cell nucleus that regulates DNA topology and facilitates nuclear processes such as DNA replication, recombination, and repair. The 3'-DNA terminus of the broken DNA strands bind covalently with the topoisomerase enzyme to form a catalytic intermediate called a cleavable complex. Irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38 bind to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevent religation of these single-strand breaks. Current research suggests that the cytotoxicity of irinotecan is due to double-strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topoisomerase I, DNA, and either Irinotecan or SN-38."
658,DB00763,"Methimazole is also indicated for the amelioration of hyperthyroid symptoms in preparation for thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine therapy. In Canada, methimazole carries the above indications and is also indicated for the medical treatment of hyperthyroidism regardless of other available treatment options.Methimazole is a thionamide antithyroid agent that inhibits the synthesis of thyroid hormones. It was first introduced as an antithyroid agent in 1949 and is now commonly used in the management of hyperthyroidism, particularly in those for whom more aggressive options such as surgery or radioactive iodine therapy are inappropriate. Traditionally, methimazole has been preferentially used over propylthiouracil due to the risk of fulminant hepatotoxicity carried by the latter, with propylthiouracil being preferred in pregnancy due to a perceived lower risk of teratogenic effects. Methimazole may directly inhibit TPO, but has been shown in vivo to instead act as a competitive substrate for TPO, thus becoming iodinated itself and interfering with the iodination of thyroglobulin."
659,DB00765,"For use in the treatment of patients with pheochromocytoma, for preoperative preparation of patients for surgery, management of patients when surgery is contraindicated, and chronic treatment of patients with malignant pheochromocytoma.An inhibitor of the enzyme tyrosine 3-monooxygenase, and consequently of the synthesis of catecholamines. It is used to control the symptoms of excessive sympathetic stimulation in patients with pheochromocytoma. The maximum biochemical effect usually occurs within two to three days, and the urinary concentration of catecholamines and their metabolites usually returns to pretreatment levels within three to four days after metyrosine is discontinued. In patients who respond, blood pressure decreases progressively during the first two days of therapy with metyrosine; after withdrawal, blood pressure usually increases gradually to pretreatment values within two to three days.Metyrosine inhibits tyrosine hydroxylase, which catalyzes the first transformation in catecholamine biosynthesis, i.e., the conversion of tyrosine to dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA). This consequently, depletes the levels of the catecholamines dopamine, adrenaline and noradrenaline in the body,usually measured as decreased urinary excretion of catecholamines and their metabolites."
660,DB00766,"Clavulanic acid combined with other antibiotics is indicated to prevent the development of drug-resistant strains of bacteria and promotes their therapeutic antibacterial effects.Acute otitis media caused by  H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis    Sinusitis due to H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis    Lower respiratory tract infections due to Haemophilus influenzae, S.aureus, Klebsiella species, and Moraxella catarrhalis     Skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella species    Urinary Tract Infections due to E. coli, Klebsiella species of bacteria, and Enterobacter species of bacteria, S.marcescens, or S.aureus    Gynecologic infections due to a variety of bacteria, including P.melaninogenicus, Enterobacter species, E.Coli species, Klebsiella species, S. aureus, S.epidermidis    Septicemia due to a variety of bacteria, including Klebsiella species, E.Coli species, S.aureus, or Pseudomonas species    Bone and joint infections due to S.aureus    Intraabdominal infections due to E.Coli, K.pnemoniae, or B.fragilis group    **A note on susceptibility**    It should be noted that it is only to be administered in infections that are confirmed or highly likely to be caused by susceptible bacteria. Culture and susceptibility tests should be performed if possible and used in selecting whether this antibiotic is prescribed. When beta-lactamase enzyme production is not detected during microbiological testing, clavulanic acid should not be used. When these tests are not available patterns of local infection and susceptibility may be used to determine the appropriateness of using clavulanic acid.The ticarcillin-clavulanic acid combination may prove to be an effective single-agent antibiotic therapy to treat infections where a regimen of several drugs may normally be used. Clavulanic acid is derived from the organism Streptomyces clavuligerus.Clavulanic acid inactivates some beta-lactamase enzymes that are produced by bacteria, therefore preventing enzymatic destruction of amoxicillin."
661,DB00768,"As a nasal spray, as a monotherapy or in combination with , olopatadine is indicated for the symptomatic relief of seasonal allergic rhinitis in patients 12 years of age and older.Olopatadine is a selective histamine H1 antagonist and mast cell stabilizer that works by attenuating inflammatory and allergic reactions. Olopatadine works by blocking the effects of histamine, which is a primary inflammatory mediator that causes inflammatory and allergic reactions. Histamine receptor activation and mast cell degranulation are primary mechanisms that cause inflammatory reactions such as ocular itching, hyperemia, chemosis, eyelid swelling, and tearing of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis. Olopatadine has a relatively rapid onset of action and prolonged duration, where it was shown to mediate anti-histaminic effects at 5 minutes to 24 hours post-administration. As a mast cell stabilizer, it stabilizes rodent basophils and human conjunctival mast cells and inhibits the immunologically-stimulated release of histamine."

Glucocorticoids are a class of steroid hormones characterised by an ability to bind with the cortisol receptor and trigger a variety of important cardiovascular, metabolic, immunologic and homeostatic effects. They act by inhibiting genes that code for the cytokines IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha, the most important of which is the IL-2. Reduced cytokine production limits T cell proliferation. Glucocorticoids also suppress humoral immunity, causing B cells to express lower amounts of IL-2 and IL-2 receptors."
663,DB00770,"Alprostadil is also used in neonatal patients with congenital heart defects that depend on a patent ductus for survival until corrective or palliative surgery can be performed. This drug causes vasodilation by directly affecting vascular and ductus arteriosus (DA) smooth muscle, preventing or reversing the functional closure of the DA that occurs shortly after birth. This results in increased pulmonary or systemic blood flow in infants.Prostaglandin E1 is produced endogenously to relax vascular smooth muscle and cause vasodilation. Neonates with congenital heart defects treated with alprostadil may experience apnea. In neonatal patients with ductus arteriosus patency, alprostadil relaxes the ductus arteriosus (DA) smooth muscle, preventing or reversing the functional closure of the DA that occurs shortly after birth."

Malathion is an irreversible cholinesterase inhibitor and has low human toxicity.Malathion is an organophosphate insecticide commonly used to control mosquitos and other flying insects. The principal toxicological effect of malathion is cholinesterase inhibition, due primarily to malaoxon and to phosphorus thionate impurities.Malathion is a nonsystemic, wide-spectrum organophosphate insecticide. The major metabolites of malathion are mono- and di-carboxylic acid derivatives, and malaoxon is a minor metabolite. However, it is malaoxon that is the strongest cholinesterase inhibitor."
666,DB00773,"Etoposide inhibits DNA synthesis by forming a complex with topoisomerase II and DNA. Accumulated breaks in DNA prevent entry into the mitotic phase of cell division, and lead to cell death. Etoposide acts primarily in the G2 and S phases of the cell cycle.Etoposide is an antineoplastic agent and an epipodophyllotoxin (a semisynthetic derivative of the podophyllotoxins). The predominant macromolecular effect of etoposide appears to be the induction of DNA strand breaks by an interaction with DNA-topoisomerase II or the formation of free radicals.Etoposide inhibits DNA topoisomerase II, thereby inhibiting DNA re-ligation. The drug is also capable of inhibiting the beta isoform but inhibition of this target is not associated with the anti-tumour activity."
667,DB00774,"Also used in the management of hypertension either as the sole therapeutic agent or to enhance the effect of other antihypertensive drugs in the more severe forms of hypertension.A thiazide diuretic with actions and uses similar to those of hydrochlorothiazide. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. Thiazides cause vasodilation by activating calcium-activated potassium channels (large conductance) in vascular smooth muscles and inhibiting various carbonic anhydrases in vascular tissue.Hydroflumethiazide is a thiazide diuretic that inhibits water reabsorption in the nephron by inhibiting the sodium-chloride symporter (SLC12A3) in the distal convoluted tubule, which is responsible for 5% of total sodium reabsorption. By blocking the sodium-chloride symporter, Hydroflumethiazide effectively reduces the osmotic gradient and water reabsorption throughout the nephron."
668,DB00775,"It is a non-peptide reversible antagonist of the platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor, and inhibits platelet aggregation.Tirofiban prevents the blood from clotting during episodes of chest pain or a heart attack, or while the patient is undergoing a procedure to treat a blocked coronary artery. It is a non-peptide antagonist of the platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor, and inhibits platelet aggregation. When administered intravenously, tirofiban inhibits ex vivo platelet aggregation in a dose- and concentration-dependent manner. Tirofiban has been recently shown in patients with unstable angina to reduce ischemic events at 48 hours following infusion when compared to standard heparin therapy.Tirofiban is a reversible antagonist of fibrinogen binding to the GP IIb/IIIa receptor, the major platelet surface receptor involved in platelet aggregation. Platelet aggregation inhibition is reversible following cessation of the infusion of tirofiban."
669,DB00776,"In Canada, oxcarbazepine is indicated for use as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients 6 years of age and older.Oxcarbazepine is an anti-epileptic medication used in the treatment of partial onset seizures that was first approved for use in the United States in 2000. It is a structural derivative of  and exerts a majority of its activity via a pharmacologically active metabolite, MHD, which exists as a racemate in the blood - a pro-drug of the more active (S)-enantiomer is also marketed as a separate anti-epileptic under the name . There have been rare reports of oxcarbazepine resulting in the development of hematologic abnormalities, including agranulocytosis and aplastic anemia. Oxcarbazepine should be discontinued at the first sign of a drug-induced skin reaction.The exact mechanism through which oxcarbazepine and its active metaoblite, MHD, exert their anti-epileptic effects is unclear, but is thought to primarily involve the blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels. Both oxcarbazepine and MHD are thought to inhibit seizure activity by binding to the inactive state of voltage-gated sodium channels, thus prolonging the period in which the receptor is unavailable for action potential propagation."
670,DB00777,"Propiomazine is largely used for its antihistamininc sleep inducing effects in treating insomnia.Propiomazine, an atypical antipsychotic agent, is used to treat both negative and positive symptoms of schizophrenia, acute mania with bipolar disorder, agitation, and psychotic symptoms in dementia. Future uses may include the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder and severe behavioral disorders in autism. Structurally and pharmacologically similar to clozapine, propiomazine binds to alpha(1), dopamine, histamine H1, muscarinic, and serotonin type 2 (5-HT2) receptors.Although propiomazine is a phenothiazine, it is not used as an antipsychotic. It posesses antihistamine effects and is mostly used as a sedative in treating insomnia.Propiomazine acts as an antagonist of dopamine 1, 2, and 4 receptors, serotonin (5-HT) receptor types 2A and 2C, muscarinic receptors 1 through 5, alpha(1)-receptors, and histamine H1-receptors. Its main use as a sedative is due to its antihistamine effect."

It is an inhibitor of the A subunit of bacterial DNA gyrase.Nalidixic acid is a quinolone antibacterial agent for oral administration. Nalidixic acid has marked antibacterial activity against gram-negative bacteria including Enterobacter species, Escherichia coli, Morganella Morganii; Proteus Mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and Providencia rettgeri. lidixic acid is bactericidal and is effective over the entire urinary pH range. Conventional chromosomal resistance to nalidixic acid taken in full dosage has been reported to emerge in approximately 2 to 14 percent of patients during treatment; however, bacterial resistance to nalidixic acid has not been shown to be transferable via R factor.Evidence exists for Nalidixic acid that its active metabolite, hydroxynalidixic acid, binds strongly, but reversibly, to DNA, interfering with synthesis of RNA and, consequently, with protein synthesis."
673,DB00780,"Phenelzine is indicated for the treatment of nonendogenous, neurotic or atypical depression for patients that do not tolerate other forms of therapy. It is important to specify the atypical feature to predict the clinical course of depression and hence generate the best treatment and service. It is a secondary condition to major personality disorder, neuroses and drug use disorders. It is currently approved under prescription by the name of Nardil.The elimination of monoamine oxidase by phenelzine results in the elevation of brain amines such as 2-phenylethylamine which is a metabolite of phenelzine. Phenelzine is shown to elevate brain levels of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and alanine (ALA) as well as to inhibit the activity of the transaminases that normally metabolize these amino acids."

It has also been used for hyperhidrosis, and cramps or spasms of the stomach, intestines or bladder.A muscarinic antagonist used as an antispasmodic, in rhinitis, in urinary incontinence, and in the treatment of ulcers. At high doses it has nicotinic effects resulting in neuromuscular blocking.Propantheline is an anticholinergic drug, a medication that reduces the effect of acetylcholine, a chemical released from nerves that stimulates muscles, by blocking the receptors for acetylcholine on smooth muscle (a type of muscle). It also has a direct relaxing effect on smooth muscle. In addition, Propantheline inhibits gastrointestinal propulsive motility and decreases gastric acid secretion and controls excessive pharyngeal, tracheal and bronchial secretions.Action is achieved via a dual mechanism: (1) a specific anticholinergic effect (antimuscarinic) at the acetylcholine-receptor sites and (2) a direct effect upon smooth muscle (musculotropic)."
675,DB00783,"It is also used in combination with other hormones as a component of oral contraceptive pills for preventing pregnancy (most commonly as , a synthetic form of estradiol). Following extensive critique of the WHI results, Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) is now recommended to be used only for a short period (for 3-5 years postmenopause) in low doses, and in women without a history of breast cancer or increased risk of cardiovascular or thromboembolic disease. Estrogen for postmenopausal symptoms should always be given with a progestin component due to estrogen's stimulatory effects on the endometrium; in women with an intact uterus, unopposed estrogen has been shown to promote the growth of the endometrium which can lead to endometrial hyperplasia and possibly cancer over the long-term. Ethinyl estradiol is different from estradiol due to its higher biovailability and increased resistance to metabolism, rendering it more suitable for oral administration.Estradiol acts on the on the estrogen receptors to relieve vasomotor systems (such as hot flashes) and urogenital symptoms (such as vaginal dryness and dyspareunia). Estradiol workings by binding to subtypes of the estrogen receptor: estrogen receptor alpha (ERÎ±) and estrogen receptor beta (ERÎ²)."
676,DB00784,"For the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, dysmenorrhea, and mild to moderate pain, inflammation, and fever.A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent with analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties. It is an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase.Mefenamic acid, an anthranilic acid derivative, is a member of the fenamate group of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It exhibits anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activities. Similar to other NSAIDs, mefenamic acid inhibits prostaglandin synthetase.Mefenamic acid binds the prostaglandin synthetase receptors COX-1 and COX-2, inhibiting the action of prostaglandin synthetase. As these receptors have a role as a major mediator of inflammation and/or a role for prostanoid signaling in activity-dependent plasticity, the symptoms of pain are temporarily reduced."
677,DB00785,"For the treatment of hypertension.Cryptenamine is a mixture of closely related hypotensive alkaloids from Veratrum album (Liliaceae). It has been used in the treatment of hypertension but has largely been replaced by drugs with fewer adverse effects.

It has been used in the treatment of hypertension but has largely been replaced by drugs with fewer adverse effects.Cryptenamine has a marked and re-producible depressor effect when given intravenously to hypertensive patients, however the mechanism of action is not known. This occurs because atropine is a competitive inhibitor of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter used by the parasympathetic nervous system)."
678,DB00787,"An acyclovir topical cream is indicated to treat recurrent herpes labialis in immunocompetent patients 12 years and older. An acyclovir topical ointment is indicated to treat initial genital herpes and limited non-life-threatening mucocutaneous herpes simplex in immunocompromised patients. An acyclovir ophthalmic ointment is indicated to treat acute herpetic keratitis.Acyclovir is a nucleotide analog antiviral used to treat herpes simplex, _Varicella zoster_, herpes zoster, herpes labialis, and acute herpetic keratitis. Acyclovir was granted FDA approval on 29 March 1982.Acyclovir is a nucleoside analog that inhibits the action of viral DNA polymerase and DNA replication of different herpesvirus. Acyclovir has a wide therapeutic window as overdose is rare in otherwise healthy patients.Acyclovir is becomes acyclovir monophosphate due to the action of viral thymidine kinase."
679,DB00788,"Further, it is first-line therapy for osteoarthritis, acute gouty arthritis, dysmenorrhea, and musculoskeletal inflammation and pain.Naproxen is classified as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory dug (NSAID) and was initially approved for prescription use in 1976 and then for over-the-counter (OTC) use in 1994. Although naproxen is an effective analgesic, it can have unintended deleterious effects in the patient. A study found that use of naproxen induced an increase in blood pressure, although the increase was not as significant as that found with ibuprofen use. Other factors that increase the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding include concurrent use of corticosteroids or anticoagulants, and a history of gastrointestinal ulcers.As with other non-selective NSAIDs, naproxen exerts it's clinical effects by blocking COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes leading to decreased prostaglandin synthesis. The COX-1 enzymes is constitutively active and can be found in normal tissues such as the stomach lining, while the COX-2 enzyme is inducible and produces prostaglandins that mediate pain, fever and inflammation."
680,DB00789,"For use with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in adults, and pediatric patients (2 years of age and older) to visualize lesions with abnormal vascularity in the brain (intracranial lesions), spine and associated tissues as well as lesions with abnormal vascularity in the head and neck. MR images are based primarily on proton density and proton relaxation dynamics. Paramagnetic agents contain one or more unpaired electrons that enhance the T1 and T2 relaxation rates of protons in their molecular environment. In the central nervous system (CNS), gadopentetate dimeglumine enhances visualization of normal tissues that lack a blood-brain barrier, such as the pituitary gland and the meninges. Abnormal vascularity or disruption of the blood-brain barrier allows accumulation of gadopentetate dimeglumine in lesions such as neoplasms, abscesses, and subacute infarcts."
681,DB00790,"ATII increases blood pressure using a number of mechanisms. ADH stimulates further water reabsorption from the kidneys via insertion of aquaporin-2 channels on the apical surface of cells of the DCT and collecting tubules. ACE inhibitors inhibit the rapid conversion of ATI to ATII and antagonize RAAS-induced increases in blood pressure. Inhibiting the deactivation of bradykinin increases bradykinin levels and may sustain the effects of perindoprilat by causing increased vasodilation and decreased blood pressure.There are two isoforms of ACE: the somatic isoform, which exists as a glycoprotein comprised of a single polypeptide chain of 1277; and the testicular isoform, which has a lower molecular mass and is thought to play a role in sperm maturation and binding of sperm to the oviduct epithelium. Perindoprilat, the active metabolite of perindopril, competes with ATI for binding to ACE and inhibits and enzymatic proteolysis of ATI to ATII."
682,DB00791,"Used for its antineoplastic properties.Nitrogen mustard derivative of uracil. It is a alkylating antineoplastic agent that is used in lymphatic malignancies, and causes mainly gastrointestinal and bone marrow damage.Uracil Mustard selectively inhibits the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The guanine and cytosine content correlates with the degree of Uracil Mustard-induced cross-linking. At high concentrations of the drug, cellular RNA and protein synthesis are also suppressed.After activation, it binds preferentially to the guanine and cytosine moieties of DNA, leading to cross-linking of DNA, thus inhibiting DNA synthesis and function."
683,DB00792,"Used for the symptomatic relief of hypersensitivity reactions, coughs, and the common cold.A histamine H1 antagonist with low sedative action but frequent gastrointestinal irritation. Tripelennamine is administered by various routes, including topically.Used to treat the effects of colds and allergies. Histamine, acting on H1-receptors, produces pruritis, vasodilatation, hypotension, flushing, headache, tachycardia, and bronchoconstriction. Tripelennamine is a histamine H1 antagonist. This blocks the action of endogenous histamine, which subsequently leads to temporary relief of the negative symptoms brought on by histamine."
684,DB00793,"Used to treat fungal (Tinea) skin infections such as athlete's foot, jock itch, ringworm, and tinea versicolor.Haloprogin is used as a topical ointment or cream in the treatment of Tinea infections. The mechanism of action is unknown, but it is thought to be via inhibition of oxygen uptake and disruption of yeast membrane structure and function. Haloprogin is no longer available in the United States and has been discontinued. Commonly these infections are named for the body part affected, including tinea corporis (general skin), tinea cruris (groin), and tinea pedis (feet).Haloprogin is a halogenated phenolic ether administered topically for dermotaphytic infections. There is a higher incidence of cutaneous side effects with haloprogin, including irritation, burning, vesiculation (blisters), scaling, and itching."
685,DB00794,"In addition, it has also been studied and utilized as an effective management of essential tremor.Primidone is an anticonvulsant used to treat essential tremor as well as grand mal, psychomotor, and focal epileptic seizures. Primidone was developed by J Yule Bogue and H C Carrington in 1949. Primidone was granted FDA Approval on 8 March 1954.Primidone alters sodium and calcium channel transport, reducing the frequency of nerve firing, which may be responsible for its effect on convulsions and essential tremor. Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of status epilepticus with abrupt cessation of primidone.Primidone and its metabolites, phenobarbital and phenylethylmalonamide (PEMA), are active anticonvulsants. Primidone does not directly interact with GABA-A receptors or chloride channels but phenobarbital does."
686,DB00795,"Sulfasalazine is also indicated as an adjunct therapy in severe ulcerative colitis.For the delayed-release tablet formulation, sulfasalazine is also indicated to treat rheumatoid arthritis in pediatric patients who have responded inadequately to salicylates or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or polyarticular-course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis with the same patients' characteristics.Sulfasalazine is an anti-inflammatory drug structurally related to salicylates and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. It is indicated for managing inflammatory diseases such as ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, sulfasalazine has less teratogenic side effects and faster onset of action compared to conventional DMARD. Although sulfasalazine is only approved by the FDA for ulcerative colitis, research have shown that sulfasalazine is also beneficial for patients with Crohn's disease. Meta-analysis of 19 randomized controlled trials indicated that sulfasalazine is superior to placebo in inducing remission; however, with no supported evidence of mucosal healing, sulfasalazine is not FDA-recommmended for treatment of Crohn's disease.The mode of action of sulfasalazine or its metabolites, 5-aminosalicylic acid and sulfapyridine, is still under investigation but may be related to the anti-inflammatory and/or immunomodulatory properties that have been observed in animal and in vitro models, to its affinity for connective tissue, and/or to the relatively high concentration it reaches in serous fluids, the liver, and intestinal walls, as demonstrated in autoradiographic studies in animals."
687,DB00796,"Candesartan lowers blood pressure by antagonizing the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS); it competes with angiotensin II for binding to the type-1 angiotensin II receptor (AT1) subtype and prevents the blood pressure increasing effects of angiotensin II. Unlike angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, ARBs do not have the adverse effect of dry cough. It may also be used as an alternative agent for the treatment of heart failure, systolic dysfunction, myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease.Candesartan cilexetil is an ARB prodrug that is rapidly converted to candesartan, its active metabolite, during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Candesartan confers blood pressure lowering effects by antagonizing the hypertensive effects of angiotensin II via the RAAS. Angiotensin II binds to two receptors: type-1 angiotensin II receptor (AT1) and type-2 angiotensin II receptor (AT2)."
688,DB00797,"For the treatment of pulmonary artery anomaliesA vasodilator that apparently has direct actions on blood vessels and also increases cardiac output. Tolazoline can interact to some degree with histamine, adrenergic, and cholinergic receptors, but the mechanisms of its therapeutic effects are not clear. It is used in treatment of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn.Tolazoline is a pulmonary vasodilator indicated used to decrease pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN).Vasodilation by means of a direct effect on peripheral vascular smooth muscle and indirect effects produced, in part, by release of endogenous histamine; tolazoline has moderate alpha-adrenergic blocking activity and has histamine agonist activity. Tolazoline usually reduces pulmonary arterial pressure and vascular resistance."
689,DB00799,"Used to treat psoriasis, acne and sun damaged skin (photodamage).Tazarotene, commonly marketed as TazoracÂ®, AvageÂ®, and ZoracÂ®, is member of the acetylenic class of retinoids. It is a prodrug that is found in topical formulations used in the treatment of various conditons, such as psoriasis, acne, and sun damaged skin (photodamage).Following topical application, tazarotene undergoes esterase hydrolysis to form its active metabolite, tazarotenic acid. Tazarotene has been shown in peer-reviewed double blinded studies to reduce: mottling and hyperpigmentation, sallowness, fine wrinkling and coarse wrinkling in sun damaged skin. Histological studies have shown that long term (greater than 1 year) use of Tazarotene is associated with a significant reduction in atypical melanocytes and keratocytes - cells considered to be precursors of skin cancer. Some studies have shown long term use of Tazarotene to be associated with increased collagen production and better organization of skin collagen bundles.Although the exact mechanism of tazarotene action is not known, studies have shown that the active form of the drug (tazarotenic acid) binds to all three members of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) family: RARa, RARb, and RARg, but shows relative selectivity for RARb, and RARg and may modify gene expression."
690,DB00800,"For the in-hospital, short-term (up to 48 hours) management of severe hypertension when rapid, but quickly reversible, emergency reduction of blood pressure is clinically indicated, including malignant hypertension with deteriorating end-organ function.A dopamine D1 receptor agonist that is used as an antihypertensive agent. It is an agonist for D1-like dopamine receptors and binds with moderate affinity to &alpha;2-adrenoceptors. It has no significant affinity for D2-like receptors, &alpha;1 and &beta;-adrenoceptors, 5HT1 and 5HT2 receptors, or muscarinic receptors. The R-isomer has approximately 250-fold higher affinity for D1-like receptors than does the S-isomer. Fenoldopam may increase norepinephrine plasma concentration."
691,DB00801,"Used to relieve anxiety, nervousness, and tension associated with anxiety disorders.Halazepam is a _benzodiazepine_ derivative drug exerting anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative, a muscle relaxing effects. It has been shown to be less toxic than chlordiazepoxide or diazepam. This drug is no longer marketed in the United States, and was withdrawn by _Schering_, its manufacturer, in 2009.Benzodiazepines bind nonspecifically to benzodiazepine receptors BNZ1, which mediates sleep, and BNZ2, which affects affects muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, motor coordination, and memory. As benzodiazepine receptors are thought to be coupled to gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptors, this enhances the effects of GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA receptor. Binding of GABA to the site opens the chloride channel, resulting in a hyperpolarized cell membrane that prevents further excitation of the cell."
692,DB00802,"For the management of postoperative pain and the maintenance of general anesthesia.A short-acting opioid anesthetic and analgesic derivative of fentanyl. Alfentanil is effective as an anesthetic during surgery, for supplementation of analgesia during surgical procedures, and as an analgesic for critically ill patients.Alfentanil is a synthetic opioid analgesic. Alfentanil interacts predominately with the opioid mu-receptor. These mu-binding sites are discretely distributed in the human brain, spinal cord, and other tissues. In clinical settings, alfentanil exerts its principal pharmacologic effects on the central nervous system."
693,DB00803,"Polymyxins are cationic polypeptides that disrupt the bacterial cell membrane through a detergentlike mechanism. With the development of less toxic agents, such as extended-spectrum penicillins and cephalosporins, parenteral polymyxin use was largely abandoned, except for the treatment of multidrug-resistant pulmonary infections in patients with cystic fibrosis. More recently, however, the emergence of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, and the lack of new antimicrobial agents have led to the revived use of the polymyxins.Colistin is a surface active agent which penetrates into and disrupts the bacterial cell membrane. Colistin is polycationic and has both hydrophobic and lipophilic moieties. It interacts with the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane, changing its permeability."
694,DB00804,"Dicyclomine is indicated for the treatment of functional bowel disorder and irritable bowel syndrome.Dicyclomine is a muscarinic M1, M3, and M2 receptor antagonist as well as a non-competitive inhibitor of histamine and bradykinin used to treat spasms of the intestines seen in functional bowel disorder and irritable bowel syndrome. Though it is commonly prescribed, its recommendation may have been based on a small amount of evidence and so its prescription is becoming less favourable. Dicyclomine was granted FDA approval on 11 May 1950.Dicyclomine is an anticholinergic drug used to relax the smooth muscles of the intestines. It's duration of action is not especially long as it is usually taken 4 times daily with individual doses of 20-40mg orally or 10-20mg by intramuscular injection. Dicyclomine should not be administered intravenously.Dicyclomine achieves its action partially through direct antimuscarinic activity of the M1, M3, and M2 receptors; and partially through antagonism of bradykinin and histamine."
695,DB00805,"For the treatment of depressionMinaprine is a psychotropic drug which has proved to be effective in the treatment of various depressive states. Like most antidepressants minaprine antagonizes behavioral despair. Minaprine  is an amino-phenylpyridazine antidepressant reported to be relatively free of cardiotoxicity, drowsiness, and weight gain.Minaprine is an amino-phenylpyridazine antidepressant reported to be relatively free of cardiotoxicity, drowsiness, and weight gain. It also binds to the serotonin reuptake pump. Therefore, minaprine blocks the reuptake of both dopamine and serotonin."
696,DB00806,"Although originally developed to treat intermittent claudication, a form of exertion-induced leg pain common in patients with peripheral arterial disease, PTX has been investigated for its possible use in diverse conditions, including osteoradionecrosis, diabetic kidney disease, and generally any condition associated with fibrosis. A branded product, PENTOXIL, marketed by Upsher-Smith Laboratories, and generic forms marketed by Valeant Pharmaceuticals and APOTEX have been available since the late 1990s.Pentoxifylline, a synthetic dimethylxanthine derivative structurally related to  and , exhibits hemorheological, anti-oxidative, and anti-inflammatory properties and is traditionally indicated in the treatment of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The classical interpretation of PTX's broad effects is due to its ability to act, _in vitro_, as a non-specific cyclic-3',5'-phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor at millimolar concentrations; specifically, it has been proposed that inhibition of PDE type III and IV isozymes leads to elevated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which mediate diverse downstream effects. Elevated cAMP levels have numerous downstream effects. cAMP-mediated activation of protein kinase A (PKA) suppresses nuclear translocation of NF-ÎºB, which suppresses transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF-Î±), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and IL-6 as well as TNF-induced molecules such as adhesion molecules (ICAM1 and VCAM1) and the C-reactive protein (CRP)."
697,DB00807,"Used as a local (ophthalmic) anesthetic.Proparacaine is a topical anesthetic drug of the amino ester group. It is found in ophthalmic solutions at a concentration of 0.5% as the hydrochloride salt.Proparacaine stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses thereby effecting local anesthetic action. More specifically, proparacaine appears to bind or antagonize the function of voltage gated sodium channels.The exact mechanism whereby proparacaine and other local anesthetics influence the permeability of the cell membrane is unknown; however, several studies indicate that local anesthetics may limit sodium ion permeability through the lipid layer of the nerve cell membrane. Proparacaine may alter epithelial sodium channels through interaction with channel protein residues. This limitation prevents the fundamental change necessary for the generation of the action potential."
698,DB00808,"reduced sodium intake) along with pharmacotherapy - it should be noted that treatment with several antihypertensive agents may be required in order to achieve blood pressure targets. Indapamide is characterized by both a methylindoline and a sulfamoyl chlorobenzamide functional group, with the former being largely responsible for the moleculeâs lipid solubility.Classified as a sulfonamide diuretic, indapamide is an effective antihypertensive agent and by extension, has shown efficacy in the prevention of target organ damage. Severe and clinically significant electrolyte disturbances may occur with indapamide use - for example, hypokalemia resulting from renal potassium loss may lead to QTc prolongation. As a result, sodium and water are retained in the lumen of the nephron for urinary excretion. Interestingly, it is likely that thiazide-like diuretics such as indapamide have additional blood pressure lowering mechanisms that are unrelated to diuresis."
699,DB00809,"Oral tropicamide has been investigated as a potential drug to relieve sialorrhea in patients with Parkinson's Disease.Tropicamide is an anticholinergic drug and that works by nonâselectively blocking muscarinic receptors to cause mydriasis and cycloplegia. The cycloplegic effect occurs within 20 to minutes following administration, with a duration of action of four to 10 hours. In response to light or binding of acetylcholine, M3 receptor signalling leads to contraction of the sphincter pupillae and pupil constriction. The eye is also innervated by parasympathetic nerves: ciliary ganglion neurons project to the ciliary body and the sphincter pupillae muscle of the iris to control ocular accommodation and pupil constriction. By binding to muscarinic receptors, tropicamide relaxes the pupillary sphincter muscle and causes pupil dilation."
700,DB00810,"It has been used in the treatment of arteriosclerotic, idiopathic, and postencephalitic parkinsonism. It has, therefore, some antisecretory, antispasmodic and mydriatic effects. In addition, biperiden possesses nicotinolytic activity. The parenteral form of biperiden is an effective and reliable agent for the treatment of acute episodes of extrapyramidal disturbances sometimes seen during treatment with neuroleptic agents. The mechanism of action of centrally active anticholinergic drugs such as biperiden is considered to relate to competitive antagonism of acetylcholine at cholinergic receptors in the corpus striatum, which then restores the balance."
701,DB00811,"The addition of ribavirin in Technivie therapy indicated for treating HCV genotype 1a and 4 infections is recommended in patients with or without cirrhosis. Producing a broad-spectrum activity against several RNA and DNA viruses, Ribavirin is a synthetic guanosine nucleoside and antiviral agent that interferes with the synthesis of viral mRNA. It is primarily indicated for use in treating hepatitis C and viral hemorrhagic fevers. Ribavirin is a prodrug that is metabolized into nucleoside analogs that blocks viral RNA synthesis and viral mRNA capping. Addition of weight-based ribavirin to Technivie therapy increased sustained virologic response after 12 weeks of daily therapy (SVR12) from 90% to 97% in patients with HCV genotype 1a and 90.9% to 100% in HCV genotype 4 patients ."
702,DB00812,"For the treatment of backache and ankylosing spondylitisA drug that has anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic activities. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1994, p1822)Phenylbutazone is a synthetic, pyrazolone derivative. It is a nonhormonal anti-inflammatory, antipyretic compound useful in the management of inflammatory conditions. The apparent analgesic effect is probably related mainly to the compound's anti-inflammatory properties and arise from its ability to reduce production of prostaglandin H and prostacyclin. Prostaglandins act on a variety of cells such as vascular smooth muscle cells causing constriction or dilation, on platelets causing aggregation or disaggregation and on spinal neurons causing pain."
703,DB00813,"These injections are also used with a neuroleptic for premedication, induction, and as an adjunct to maintenance of anesthesia. Finally, fentanyl intravenous or intramuscular injections are used with oxygen for anesthesia in high risk patients. In 2017, 47600 overdose deaths in the United States involved some opioid (over 2/3 of all overdose deaths). It has a duration of action of several hours and a wider therapeutic index as patients develop tolerance to opioids. Activation of opioid receptors causes GTP to be exchanged for GDP on the G-proteins which in turn down regulates adenylate cyclase, reducing concentrations of cAMP."
704,DB00814,"Meloxicam is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of arthritis and osteoarthritis. In addition to the above, meloxicam has also been studied in the treatment of neuropathic pain.Meloxicam is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve various types of pain, including pain caused by musculoskeletal conditions, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Meloxicam is available in oral, transdermal, and intravenous formulations. It is a preferential COX-2 inhibitor, purportedly reducing the risk of adverse gastrointestinal tract effects, however, this is a topic of controversy.Meloxicam is an anti-inflammatory, analgesic analgesic with antipyretic effects in fever. A note on gastrointestinal effects    As meloxicam preferentially inhibits COX-2, it is thought to cause less gastrointestinal irritation compared to other NSAIDS."
705,DB00816,"Orciprenaline (also known as metaproterenol), a synthetic amine, is structurally and pharmacologically similar to isoproterenol. Orciprenaline is used exclusively as a bronchodilator. Increased cAMP levels lead to relaxation of bronchial smooth muscles and inhibition of the release of inalammatory mediators from mast cells that are involved in promoting immediate hypersensitivity .Orciprenaline stimulates the Î²2-adrenergic receptor expressed in the lungs, uterus, and vasculature supplying skeletal muscles by acting as a moderately selective agonist. It exerts minimal or no effect on alpha-adrenergic receptors. Intracellularly, the actions of orciprenaline are mediated by cAMP, the production of which is augmented by beta stimulation."
706,DB00817,"For the treatment of bacterial infection of respiratory tract, urinary tract, GI, CNS and immuno compromised patients.Rosoxacin is a quinolone derivative antibiotic for the treatment of bacterial infection of respiratory tract, urinary tract, GI, CNS and immuno compromised patients. Rosoxacin is known to be effective against penicillin resistant strains and is a single dose orally administered drug, which avoids all complications of parenteral administration seen with penicillin, especially anaphylactic shock.Rosoxacin is a nonfluorinated quinolone antibiotic. Its mode of action depends on blocking of bacterial DNA replication by binding itself to an enzyme called DNA gyrase, which allows the untwisting required to replicate one DNA double helix into two. Rosoxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.Rosoxacin binds to and inhibits the enzymes topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV, which are required for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination."
707,DB00818,"Used for induction and/or maintenance of anaesthesia and for management of refractory status epilepticus. Propofol is an intravenous anaesthetic agent used for induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia. IV administration of propfol is used to induce unconsciousness after which anaesthesia may be maintained using a combination of medications. Recovery from propofol-induced anaesthesia is generally rapid and associated with less frequent side effects (e.g. drowsiness, nausea, vomiting) than with thiopental, methohexital, and etomidate. Propofol may be used prior to diagnostic procedures requiring anaesthesia, in the management of refractory status epilepticus, and for induction and/or maintenance of anaesthesia prior to and during surgeries.Propofol is a sedative-hypnotic agent for use in the induction and maintenance of anesthesia or sedation."
708,DB00819,"For adjunctive treatment of: edema due to congestive heart failure; drug-induced edema; centrencephalic epilepsies; chronic simple (open-angle) glaucomaOne of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitors that is sometimes effective against absence seizures. It is sometimes useful also as an adjunct in the treatment of tonic-clonic, myoclonic, and atonic seizures, particularly in women whose seizures occur or are exacerbated at specific times in the menstrual cycle. However, its usefulness is transient often because of rapid development of tolerance. Its antiepileptic effect may be due to its inhibitory effect on brain carbonic anhydrase, which leads to an increased transneuronal chloride gradient, increased chloride current, and increased inhibition. (From Smith and Reynard, Textbook of Pharmacology, 1991, p337)Acetazolamide is a potent carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, effective in the control of fluid secretion, in the treatment of certain convulsive disorders and in the promotion of diuresis in instances of abnormal fluid retention."
709,DB00820,"In contrast to other PDE5 inhibitors like , tadalafil has greater selectivity for PDE5 and a longer half-life which has made it a more suitable option for chronic once-daily dosing in the treatment of PAH.Tadalafil exerts a therapeutic effect in ED by increasing sexual stimulation-dependant smooth muscle relaxation in the penis, allowing the corpus cavernosum to fill with blood to produce an erection. Smooth muscle relaxation in the pulmonary vasculature helps to produce vasodilation in PAH which reduces blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. In BPH, tadalafil may contribute to decreased smooth muscle cell proliferation which may reduce the size of the prostate and relieve the anatomical obstruction which produces urinary symptoms of BPH. Inhibition of PDE5 by tadalafil increases signaling via the PKG cascade which supports penile smooth muscle relaxation during sexual arousal by decreasing Ca2+ entry into smooth muscle cells. It may instead exert its effect through a mix of increased oxygenation and decreased inflammation, which decreases tissue remodeling, and inhibition of cell proliferation through the cGMP cascade."
710,DB00821,"For use as a pain reliever in the treatment of joint pain and post-surgical pain.Carprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is used by veterinarians as a supportive treatment for the relief of arthritic symptoms in geriatric dogs. Carprofen was previously used in human medicine for over 10 years (1985-1995). It was generally well tolerated, with the majority of adverse effects being mild, such as gastro-intestinal pain and nausea, similar to those recorded with aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The constitutive cyclooxygenase, COX-1, synthesizes prostaglandins necessary for normal gastrointestinal and renal function. Inhibition of COX-1 is thought to be associated with gastrointestinal and renal toxicity while inhibition of COX-2 provides anti-inflammatory activity."
711,DB00822,"For the treatment and management of chronic alcoholismA carbamate derivative used as an alcohol deterrent. When alcohol is ingested after administration of disulfiram, blood acetaldehyde concentrations are increased, followed by flushing, systemic vasodilation, respiratory difficulties, nausea, hypotension, and other symptoms (acetaldehyde syndrome). It acts by inhibiting aldehyde dehydrogenase.Disulfiram produces a sensitivity to alcohol which results in a highly unpleasant reaction when the patient under treatment ingests even small amounts of alcohol. Accumulation of acetaldehyde in the blood produces a complex of highly unpleasant symptoms referred to hereinafter as the disulfiram-alcohol reaction. Prolonged administration of disulfiram does not produce tolerance; the longer a patient remains on therapy, the more exquisitely sensitive he becomes to alcohol.Disulfiram blocks the oxidation of alcohol at the acetaldehyde stage during alcohol metabolism following disulfiram intake causing an accumulation of acetaldehyde in the blood producing highly unpleasant symptoms."
712,DB00823,"Although etynodiol or ethynodiol are sometimes used as a synonym for ethynodiol diacetate, what is usually being referred to is actually ethynodiol diacetate and not ethynodiol (which is a separate drug that has never been marketed, see ).Ethynodiol Diacetate is used as a female contraceptive. Ethynodiol Diacetate is a progestin or a synthetic form of the naturally occurring female sex hormone, progesterone. If pregnancy occurs, progesterone levels in the body remain high, maintaining the womb lining. If pregnancy does not occur, progesterone levels in the body fall, resulting in a menstrual period. This prevents the release of eggs from the ovaries.Binds to the progesterone and estrogen receptors."
713,DB00825,"Forming clear or white waxy, crystalline substance, menthol is typically solid at room temperature. (-)-Menthol is the naturally-occurring and main form of menthol, and is assigned the (1R,2S,5R) configuration. Menthol mediates anesthetic properties and anti-irritating properties locally, thus it is widely used to relieve minor throat irritations.Menthol is a covalent organic compound made synthetically or obtained from peppermint or other mint oils. Menthol induces a cooling sensation on the skin upon inhalation, oral ingestion, or topical application by stimulating the cold-sensitive receptors expressed on the skin, without actually causing a drop in the skin temperature. Menthol primarily activates the cold-sensitive TRPM8 receptors in the skin."
714,DB00826,"It is a tetraene polyene antibiotic derived from Streptomyces natalensis. It possesses in vitro activity against a variety of yeast and filamentous fungi, including Candida, Aspergillus, Cephalosporium, Fusarium and Penicillium. Natamycin is not effective in vitro against gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria. Topical administration appears to produce effective concentrations of natamycin within the corneal stroma but not in intraocular fluid.Like other polyene antibiotics, Natamycin inhibits fungal growth by binding to sterols. Specifically, Natamycin binds to ergosterol in the plasma membrane, preventing ergosterol-dependent fusion of vacuoles, as well as membrane fusion and fission."
715,DB00827,"For the treatment of initial and recurrent urinary tract infections in adults caused by the following susceptible microorganisms: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiella species (including K. pneumoniae), and Enterobacter species.Synthetic antimicrobial related to oxolinic acid and nalidixic acid and used in urinary tract infections.Cinoxacin is a synthetic antibacterial agent with in vitro activity against many gram-negative aerobic bacteria, particularly strains of the Enterobacteriaceae family. Cinoxacin inhibits bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis, is bactericidal, and is active over the entire urinary pH range. Cross resistance with nalidixic acid has been demonstrated.Evidence exists that cinoxacin binds strongly, but reversibly, to DNA, interfering with synthesis of RNA and, consequently, with protein synthesis. It appears to also inhibit DNA gyrase. This enzyme is necessary for proper replicated DNA separation."
716,DB00828,"In terms of chemical structure, fosfomycin is a phosphoenolpyruvate analog and contains a phosphonic group and an epoxide ring. Due to its ease of administration as a single 3-gram oral dose and desirable safety profile, fosfomycin has largely become a first-line therapeutic option for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) in females. As such there is great interest in exploring the usefulness of fosfomycin for indications beyond the treatment of UTIs.Although used primarily to treat urinary tract infections, fosfomycin has been shown to act synergistically with other antibiotics against clinically relevant bacteria. Fosfomycin also has important effects on cell adhesion. For example, the adhesion of bacterial cells to urinary epithelial cells is reduced in the presence of fosfomycin."

Its actions and mechanisms are similar to dextroamphetamine.Phenmetrazine is a sympathomimetic drug used primarily as an appetite depressant. Amphetamines are non-catecholamine sympathomimetic amines with CNS stimulant activity. Phenmetrazine was originally sold under the tradename Preludin as an anorectic. It is by some considered to have a greater potential for addiction than the amphetamines, and has been abused in many countries, for example Sweden.Phenmetrazine is thought to block the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron leading to an increase in the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space."

It is used as an antipsychotic and an antiemetic.Trifluoperazine is a trifluoro-methyl phenothiazine derivative intended for the management of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Trifluoperazine has not been shown effective in the management of behaviorial complications in patients with mental retardation.Trifluoperazine blocks postsynaptic mesolimbic dopaminergic D1 and D2 receptors in the brain; depresses the release of hypothalamic and hypophyseal hormones and is believed to depress the reticular activating system thus affecting basal metabolism, body temperature, wakefulness, vasomotor tone, and emesis."

In vitro tests demonstrate that the bactericidal action of the cephalosporins results from inhibition of cell-wall synthesis. As indicated by _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ clinical studies, cefaclor was shown to be effective against most strains of Gram positive aerobes - Staphylococci (including coagulase-positive, coagulase-negative, and penicillinase-producing strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes (group A &szlig;-hemolytic streptococci), as well as Gram-negative aerobes - Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae (including &szlig;-lactamase-producing ampicillin-resistant strains), Klebsiella sp, and Proteus mirabilis.Cefaclor, like the penicillins, is a beta-lactam antibiotic. By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, it inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins."
722,DB00834,"Also indicated to control hyperglycemia secondary to hypercortisolism in adult patients with endogenous Cushing's syndrome who have type 2 diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance and are not candidates for surgery or have had unsuccessful surgery.Mifepristone is a progestational and glucocorticoid hormone antagonist. Its inhibition of progesterone induces bleeding during the luteal phase and in early pregnancy by releasing endogenous prostaglandins from the endometrium or decidua. Currently under investigation for use in psychotic depression (phase 3 trials).Mifepristone is a synthetic steroid with antiprogestational effects indicated for the medical termination of intrauterine pregnancy through 49 days' pregnancy. The termination of pregnancy results. In the treatment of Cushing's syndrome, Mifepristone blocks the binding of cortisol to its receptor."
723,DB00835,"For the treatment of the symptoms of the common cold and allergic rhinitis, such as runny nose, itchy eyes, watery eyes, and sneezing.Histamine H1 antagonist used in treatment of allergies, rhinitis, and urticaria.Brompheniramine is an antihistaminergic medication of the propylamine class. It is a first-generation antihistamine. In allergic reactions an allergen interacts with and cross-links surface IgE antibodies on mast cells and basophils. Once the mast cell-antibody-antigen complex is formed, a complex series of events occurs that eventually leads to cell-degranulation and the release of histamine (and other chemical mediators) from the mast cell or basophil. Once released, histamine can react with local or widespread tissues through histamine receptors."
724,DB00836,"However, loperamide is associated with a risk for experiencing a range of adverse effects, often life-threatening, if taking for non-therapeutic reasons or at doses higher than the recommended dose.Loperamide is an anti-diarrheal agent that provides symptomatic relief of diarrhea. It decreases peristalsis and fluid secretion in the gastrointestinal tract, delays colonic transit time, and increases the absorption of fluids and electrolytes from the gastrointestinal tract. It also increases the tone of the anal sphincter, thereby reducing incontinence and urgency. While loperamide is a potent mu-opioid receptor agonist, it does not mediate significant analgesic activity at therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses. Loperamide stimulates the intestinal absorption of water and electrolytes by inhibiting calmodulin."
725,DB00838,"For short-term topical treatment of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of moderate to severe corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses of the scalp.Clocortolone is a medium potency corticosteroid that is often used as a topical cream for the relief of inflammatory oand pruritic (itching) arising from steroid-responsive dermatoses of the scalp.Like other topical corticosteroids, clocortolone has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Clocortolone is a moderate potency topical corticosteroid that should not be used with occlusive dressings. It is recommended that treatment should be limited to 2 consecutive weeks and therapy should be discontinued when adequate results have been achieved.The precise mechanism of the antiinflammatory activity of topical steroids in the treatment of steroid-responsive dermatoses, in general, is uncertain. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins."
726,DB00839,"For use as an adjunct to diet to lower the blood glucose in patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (Type II) whose hyperglycemia cannot be satisfactorily controlled by diet alone.A sulphonylurea hypoglycemic agent with actions and uses similar to those of chlorpropamide.Tolazamide is an oral blood glucose lowering drug of the sulfonylurea class. The mechanism by which tolazamide lowers blood glucose during long-term administration has not been clearly established. Extrapancreatic effects may be involved in the mechanism of action of oral sulfonylurea hypoglycemic drugs. Some patients who are initially responsive to oral hypoglycemic drugs, including tolazamide, may become unresponsive or poorly responsive over time. Alternatively, tolazamide may be effective in some patients who have become unresponsive to one or more other sulfonylurea drugs."
727,DB00841,"Indicated when parenteral therapy is necessary for inotropic support in the short-term treatment of patients with cardiac decompensation due to depressed contractility resulting either from organic heart disease or from cardiac surgical procedures.A beta-1 agonist catecholamine that has cardiac stimulant action without evoking vasoconstriction or tachycardia. It is proposed as a cardiotonic after myocardial infarction or open heart surgery.Dobutamine is a direct-acting inotropic agent whose primary activity results from stimulation of the beta-adrenoceptors of the heart while producing comparatively mild chronotropic, hypertensive, arrhythmogenic, and vasodilative effects. Dobutamine acts primarily on beta-1 adrenergic receptors, with negligible effects on beta-2 or alpha receptors. It does not cause the release of endogenous norepinephrine, as does dopamine. Dobutamine directly stimulates beta-1 receptors of the heart to increase myocardial contractility and stroke volume, resulting in increased cardiac output."
728,DB00842,"It may also be used in the management of alcohol withdrawal symptoms.Oxazepam is an intermediate-acting, 3-hydroxybenzodiazepine used in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal and anxiety disorders. Oxazepam, like related 3-hydroxybenzodiazepine , is considered less susceptible to pharmacokinetic variability based on patient-specific factors (e.g. age, liver disease) - this feature is advantageous as compared to other benzodiazepines, and is likely owing in part to oxazepam's relatively simple metabolism. Compared to other benzodiazepines, it has relatively low potency and a moderate duration of action. Oxazepam should be administered with caution to patients for whom a drop in blood pressure may lead to cardiac complications as, in rare cases, it may cause hypotension.Like other benzodiazepines, oxazepam exerts its anxiolytic effects by potentiating the effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on GABA(A) receptors, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the mammalian brain. GABA(A) receptors are a component of GABA-gated ionotropic chloride channels that produce inhibitory postsynaptic potentials - following activation by GABA, the channel undergoes a conformational change that allows the passage of chloride ions through the channel."
729,DB00843,"Donepezil, administered orally or via transdermal delivery system, is indicated for the treatment of dementia of the Alzheimer's type.L7937]     Off-label uses include the management of vascular dementia, Parkinson's Disease-associated dementia, and Lewy body dementia, amongst others.In 2016, the global burden of dementia was estimated to be 43.8 million, demonstrating a significant increase from a global prevalence of 20.2 million in 1990. A donepezil transdermal delivery system, Adlarity, was approved by the FDA in March 2022 for the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia. Though it does not alter the progression of Alzheimer's disease, donepezil is effective in managing the symptoms of its associated dementia.By inhibiting the acetylcholinesterase enzyme, donepezil improves the cognitive and behavioral signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease, which may include apathy, aggression, confusion, and psychosis. The commonly accepted cholinergic hypothesis proposes that a portion of the cognitive and behavioral decline associated with Alzheimer's are the result of decreased cholinergic transmission in the central nervous system. Donepezil selectively and reversibly inhibits the acetylcholinesterase enzyme, which normally breaks down acetylcholine."
730,DB00844,"For the relief of moderate to severe pain.A narcotic used as a pain medication. It appears to be an agonist at kappa opioid receptors and an antagonist or partial agonist at mu opioid receptors. Nalbuphine by itself has potent opioid antagonist activity at doses equal to or lower than its analgesic dose. Nalbuphine should be used with caution in patients who have been receiving mu opioid analgesics on a regular basis.The exact mechanism of action is unknown, but is believed to interact with an opiate receptor site in the CNS (probably in or associated with the limbic system). It is also a partial mu antagonist analgesic, with some binding to the delta receptor and minimal agonist activity at the sigma receptor."
731,DB00845,"Cordran is primarily effective because of its anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive actions. Flurandrenolide, which is slowly released from the Cordran tape, binds to the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor. After binding the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Like other glucocorticoid agents Fluocinolone acetonide acts as a physiological antagonist to insulin by decreasing glycogenesis (formation of glycogen)."

733,DB00847,"The hydrochloride salt, used in eye drop preparations, is indicated for the treatment of corneal cystine crystal accumulation in patients with cystinosis. Several preparations of cysteamine exist for the treatment of cystinosis manifestations, some in capsule form, and others in ophthalmic solution form. In particular, cystine deposits on the eye can cause significant discomfort throughout the day and require frequent treatment with eye drops, typically every waking hour. Cysteamine prevents the accumulation of cystine crystals in the body and is specifically prescribed to prevent kidney and eye damage. The cystine crystals may cause considerable damage, particularly in the renal tissues and corneal tissues."
734,DB00848,"It was manufactured by _Janssen_ and first used in 1969 as an agent to treat worm infestations Levamisole was approved by the FDA in 1990 as an adjuvant treatment for colon cancer. This drug has also been used in combination with other drugs for the treatment of various cancers. Levamisole was withdrawn from the American market in 2000 due to its ability to cause serious adverse effects, including agranulocytosis. Interestingly, levamisole has been found as an adulterant in cocaine and can lead to a variety of adverse effects in individuals using this drug.Levamisole is a synthetic imidazothiazole derivative that has been widely used in treatment of worm infestations in both humans and animals. As an immunomodulator, it appears that Levamisole is an immunostimulant which has been shown to increase NK cells and activated T-cells in patients receiving this adjuvantly along with 5FU for Stage III colon cancer.The mechanism of action of levamisole as an antiparasitic agent appears to be tied to its agnositic activity towards the L-subtype nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in nematode muscles."
735,DB00849,"For the relief of anxiety, tension, and apprehension, also used as an anticonvulsant for the treatment of epilepsy.A barbiturate that is metabolized to phenobarbital. It has been used for similar purposes, especially in epilepsy, but there is no evidence mephobarbital offers any advantage over phenobarbital.Methylphenobarbital, a barbiturate, is used in combination with acetaminophen or aspirin and caffeine for its sedative and relaxant effects in the treatment of tension headaches, migraines, and pain. Barbiturates act as nonselective depressants of the central nervous system (CNS), capable of producing all levels of CNS mood alteration from excitation to mild sedation, hypnosis, and deep coma. In sufficiently high therapeutic doses, barbiturates induce anesthesia.Methylphenobarbital binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl- ionopore at the GABAA receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl- ionopore is open. The post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA in the thalamus is, therefore, prolonged."
736,DB00850,"For use in the management of the manifestations of psychotic disorders and for the control of severe nausea and vomiting in adults.An antipsychotic phenothiazine derivative with actions and uses similar to those of chlorpromazine.Perphenazine is a piperazinyl phenothiazine, acts on the central nervous system, and has a greater behavioral potency than other phenothiazine derivatives whose side chains do not contain a piperazine moiety. It is a member of a class of drugs called phenothiazines, which are dopamine D1/D2 receptor antagonists. Perphenazine is 10 to 15 times as potent as chlorpromazine; that means perphenazine is a highly potent antipsychotic. In equivalent doses it has approximately the same frequency and severity of early and late extrapypramidal side-effects compared to Haloperidol.Binds to the dopamine D1 and dopamine D2 receptors and inhibits their activity. The mechanism of the anti-emetic effect is due predominantly to blockage of the dopamine D2 neurotransmitter receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone and vomiting centre."
737,DB00851,"It has significant activity against melanomas. Dacarbazine with Oblimersen is in clinical trials for the treatment of malignant melanoma.Dacarbazine is a synthetic analog of naturally occurring purine precursor 5-amino-1H-imidazole-4-carboxamide (AIC). 1 In a patient with renal and hepatic dysfunctions, the half-lives were lengthened to 55 minutes and 7.2 hours. At therapeutic concentrations dacarbazine is not appreciably bound to human plasma protein.The mechanism of action is not known, but appears to exert cytotoxic effects via its action as an alkylating agent. Other theories include DNA synthesis inhibition by its action as a purine analog, and interaction with SH groups."
738,DB00852,"The decongestant effect of pseudoephedrine was described in dogs in 1927.Pseudoephedrine causes vasoconstriction which leads to a decongestant effect. It has a short duration of action unless formulated as an extended release product. This agonism of adrenergic receptors produces vasoconstriction which is used as a decongestant and as a treatment of priapism. The sympathomimetic effects of pseudoephedrine include an increase in mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and chronotropic response of the right atria. Pseudoephedrine is also a partial agonist of the anococcygeal muscle."
739,DB00853,"Temozolomide is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma concomitantly with radiotherapy and for use as maintenance treatment thereafter. It is also indicated for the treatment of refractory anaplastic astrocytoma in adult patients or adjuvant therapy for adults with newly diagnosed anaplastic astrocytoma.Refractory anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO grade III) and Glioblastoma multiforme (WHO grade IV) are primary malignant brain tumours with poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Temozolomide is an imidazotetrazine prodrug that is stable at acidic pH but undergoes spontaneous nonenzymatic hydrolysis at neutral or slightly basic pH; these properties allow for both oral and intravenous administration. Pneumocystis pneumonia may occur in patients undergoing treatment, and prophylaxis should be provided for patients in the concomitant phase of therapy with monitoring at all stages. If not repaired by MGMT, O6-MeG mispairs with thymine, activating the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) pathway that removes the thymine (not the O6-MeG), resulting in futile cycles of repair and eventual DNA strand breaks leading to apoptosis."
740,DB00854,"For the management of moderate to severe pain or as a preoperative medication where an opioid analgesic is appropriate.A narcotic analgesic that may be habit-forming. It is nearly as effective orally as by injection.Levorphanol is a potent synthetic opioid analgesic indicated for the management of moderate to severe pain or as a preoperative medication where an opioid analgesic is appropriate. Levorphanol is similar to morphine in its actions, however it is up to 8 times more potent than morphine. Levorphanol produces a degree of respiratory depression similar to that produced by morphine at equianalgesic doses, and like many mu-opioid drugs, levorphanol produces euphoria or has a positive effect on mood in many individuals.Like other mu-agonist opioids it is believed to act at receptors in the periventricular and periaqueductal gray matter in both the brain and spinal cord to alter the transmission and perception of pain."
741,DB00855,"As a topical gel, aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is indicated for lesion-directed and field-directed treatment of actinic keratoses (AKs) of mild-to-moderate severity on the face and scalp in combination with photodynamic therapy (PDT) using BF-RhodoLEDÂ® lamp, a narrowband, red light illumination source. As a topical solution, ALA can also be used for the same indication mentioned previously in addition to AKs of the upper extremities, but in conjunction with blue light illumination using the BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator. Finally, ALA is also available as an oral solution to be used as an adjunct for the visualization of glioma during surgery.A compound produced from succinyl-CoA and glycine as an intermediate in heme synthesis. ALA, when provided to the cell, bypasses this control point and results in the accumulation of PpIX, which is converted into heme by ferrochelatase through the addition of iron to the PpIX nucleus.According to the presumed mechanism of action, photosensitization following application of aminolevulinic acid (ALA) topical solution occurs through the metabolic conversion of ALA to protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), which accumulates in the skin to which aminolevulinic acid has been applied. The absorption of light results in an excited state of the porphyrin molecule, and subsequent spin transfer from PpIX to molecular oxygen generates singlet oxygen, which can further react to form superoxide and hydroxyl radicals."
742,DB00856,"Used, along with rest and physical therapy, to treat injuries and other painful muscular conditions. Investigated for use in trigeminal neuralgia (tic douloureux), a neuropathic disorder characterized by severe facial pain. Was investigated as a modulator of histamine release.Chlorphenesin is a muscle relaxant. It blocks nerve impulses (or pain sensations) that are sent to the brain. The mechanism of action of chlorphenesin is not well defined, and its effects are measured mainly by subjective responses."
743,DB00857,"Terbinafine hydrochloride also treats yeast infections of the skin caused by _Candida_ species and _Malassezia furfur_.Terbinafine hydrochloride (Lamisil) is a synthetic allylamine antifungal. It is highly lipophilic in nature and tends to accumulate in skin, nails, and fatty tissues. Terbinafine hydrochloride was granted FDA approval on 30 December 1992.Terbinafine is an allylamine antifungal that inhibits squalene epoxidase (also known as squalene monooxygenase) to prevent the formation of ergosterol and cause an accumulation of squalene, weakening the cell wall of fungal cells. Terbinafine distributes into tissues and has a long terminal elimination half life, so the duration of action is long. Overdose with terbinafine is rare, even above the therapeutic dose, so the therapeutic index is wide."
744,DB00859,"For treatment of Wilson's disease, cystinuria and active rheumatoid arthritis.Penicillamine is a pharmaceutical of the chelator class. It is also used to reduce cystine excretion in cystinuria and to treat patients with severe, active rheumatoid arthritis unresponsive to conventional therapy. In Wilson's disease it binds copper, allowing it to be eliminated in the urine.Penicillamine is a chelating agent recommended for the removal of excess copper in patients with Wilson's disease. The mechanism of action of penicillamine in rheumatoid arthritis is unknown although it appears to suppress disease activity. Also unlike cytotoxic immunosuppressants which act on both, penicillamine in vitro depresses T-cell activity but not B-cell activity."
745,DB00860,"Prednisolone is indicated to treat endocrine, rheumatic, and hematologic disorders; collagen, dermatologic, ophthalmic, respiratory, and gastrointestinal diseases; allergic and edematous states; and other conditions like tuberculous meningitis.Prednisolone is a glucocorticoid similar to  used for its anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, anti-neoplastic, and vasoconstrictive effects. Prednisolone was granted FDA approval on 21 June 1955.Corticosteroids bind to the glucocorticoid receptor, inhibiting pro-inflammatory signals, and promoting anti-inflammatory signals. Prednisolone has a short duration of action as the half life is 2.1-3.5 hours. Patients taking corticosteroids should be counselled regarding the risk of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression and increased susceptibility to infections.The short term effects of corticosteroids are decreased vasodilation and permeability of capillaries, as well as decreased leukocyte migration to sites of inflammation. Lower doses of corticosteroids provide an anti-inflammatory effect, while higher doses are immunosuppressive."
746,DB00861,"Diflunisal is used to relieve pain accompanied with inflammation and in the symptomatic treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.Diflunisal is a nonsteroidal drug with analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties. Chemically, diflunisal differs from aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) in two respects. Diflunisal is not metabolized to salicylic acid, and the fluorine atoms are not displaced from the difluorophenyl ring structure.The precise mechanism of the analgesic and anti-inflammatory actions of diflunisal is not known. Diflunisal is a prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor. Since prostaglandins are known to be among the mediators of pain and inflammation, the mode of action of diflunisal may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues."
747,DB00862,"During sexual stimulation, nitric oxide (NO) is released from nerve endings and endothelial cells in the corpus cavernosum, activating the enzyme guanylate cyclase and increasing the synthesis of cGMP in the smooth muscle cells of the corpus cavernosum. PDE5 inhibitors, such as vardenafil, inhibit the degradation of cGMP and allow increased blood flow into the penis, resulting in an erection.. The use of vardenafil as a monotherapy for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension has also been evaluated.Vardenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), an enzyme responsible for the degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. Without sexual stimulation and no cGMP production, vardenafil should not cause an erection. Patients taking PDE5 inhibitors, such as vardenafil, may also develop sudden hearing loss and experience a prolonged QT interval.Vardenafil inhibits cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP) specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for the degradation of cyclic GMP in the corpus cavernosum located around the penis."
748,DB00863,"It also used in the short term treatment of active benign gastric ulcers and maintenance therapy of gastric ulcers at a reduced dose. In addition to the above, ranitidine can be used for the treatment of GERD symptoms, treatment of erosive esophagitis (endoscopically diagnosed) and the maintenance of gastric or duodenal ulcer healing.Ranitidine is a commonly used drug, classified as a histamine H2-receptor antagonist, and belongs to the same drug class as  and . This drug helps to prevent and treat gastric-acid associated conditions, including ulcers, because of its ability to decrease gastric acid secretion. Ranitidine has proven to be an effective treatment for relieving uncomfortable symptoms of gastric acid associated conditions and is therefore widely used in GERD and other gastric-acid related conditions.Ranitidine decreases the secretion of gastric acid stimulated by food and drugs. Ranitidine reduces the secretion of gastric acid by reversible binding to histamine (H2) receptors, which are found on gastric parietal cells."
749,DB00864,"This FKBP12-FK506 complex inhibits calcineurin which inhibits T-lymphocyte signal transduction and IL-2 transcription.Tacrolimus acts by reducing peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity by binding to the immunophilin FKBP-12 (FK506 binding protein) creating a new complex. This inhibits both T-lymphocyte signal transduction and IL-2 transcription. Tacrolimus has also been shown to be effective in the topical treatment of eczema, particularly atopic eczema. On other parts of the body, topical steroid are generally a better treatment.The mechanism of action of tacrolimus in atopic dermatitis is not known. It has been demonstrated that tacrolimus inhibits T-lymphocyte activation by first binding to an intracellular protein, FKBP-12."
750,DB00865,"(From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p1222)Benzphetamine, a phenylalkylamin, is related to amphetamine both chemically and pharmacologically. It is an anorectic agent indicated in the management of exogenous obesity as a short term adjunct (a few weeks) in a regimen of weight reduction based on caloric restriction. Benzphetamine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, the amphetamines. Actions include central nervous system stimulation and elevation of blood pressure. Amphetamines stimulate noepinephrine and dopamine release in nerve endings in the lateral hypothalamic feeding centre, decreasing appetite."
751,DB00867,"For the treatment and prophylaxis of premature labourAdrenergic beta-agonist used to control premature labor.Beta-2 adrenergic receptors are located at sympathetic neuroeffector junctions of many organs, including uterus. Ritodrine is beta-2 adrenergic agonist. The decrease of calcium concentration leads to a relaxation of uterine smooth muscle and, therefore, a decrease in premature uterine contractions. Ritodrine is beta-2 adrenergic agonist. It binds to beta-2 adrenergic receptors on outer membrane of myometrial cell, activates adenyl cyclase to increase the level of cAMP which decreases intracellular calcium and leads to a decrease of uterine contractions."
752,DB00868,"Benzonatate is indicated for the symptomatic relief of cough.Benzonatate is an oral antitussive drug used in the relief and suppression of cough in patients older than ten years of age. Currently, benzonatate is the only non-narcotic antitussive available as a prescription drug. It works to reduce the activity of cough reflex by desensitizing the tissues of the lungs and pleura involved in the cough reflex. Its onset of action is within 15 to 20 minutes following administration and its duration of effect is about 3 to 8 hours.Benzonatate is a local anesthetic drug that acts peripherally by anesthetizing and reducing the activity of vagal stretch receptors or nerve fibres located in the respiratory passages, lungs, and pleura. Anesthetizing these receptors by benzonatate results in the inhibition of the cough reflex activity and cough production."
753,DB00869,"Dorzolamide is indicated for the management of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma. Its pre-operative use was also investigated to prevent elevated intraocular pressure after neodynium yttrium aluminum garnet laser posterior capsulotomy.Dorzolamide is a non-bacteriostatic sulfonamide derivative  and topical carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitor that treats elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) associated with open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension. First marketed in 1995, dorzolamide is available in ophthalmic solutions as monotherapy marketed as Trusopt  or in combination with  as Cosopt PF.Dorzolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that reduces elevated intraocular pressure in open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. When there is an increase in the resistance to the trabecular outflow of aqueous humour, the intraocular pressure is elevated. The inhibition of CA-II in the ciliary process disrupts the formation of bicarbonate ions and reduces sodium and fluid transport, which leads to decreased aqueous humour secretion and reduced intraocular pressure."
754,DB00870,"Used as eye drops to inhibit the miosis (pupil constriction) that may occur during ocular surgery.An ibuprofen-type anti-inflammatory analgesic and antipyretic. It inhibits prostaglandin synthesis and has been proposed as an anti-arthritic. Ophthalmic anti-inflammatory medicines are used in the eye to lessen problems that can occur during or after some kinds of eye surgery. Suprofen is used to help prevent this.Suprofen binds to the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) isoenzymes, preventing the synthesis of prostaglandins and reducing the inflammatory response. The overall result is a reduction in pain and inflammation in the eyes and the prevention of pupil constriction during surgery."
755,DB00871,"It is a selective beta-2 adrenergic agonist used as a bronchodilator in asthmatic patients. Terbutaline was granted FDA approval on 25 March 1974.Terbutaline is a beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist indicated to treat reversibly bronchospasm in asthmatic patients with bronchitis and emphysema. It has a short duration as the inhaled form is taken up to three times daily, and the therapeutic window is wide.Terbutaline is a selective beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist. Agonism of these receptors in bronchioles activates adenylyl cyclase, increasing intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Increased cAMP decreases intracellular calcium, activating protein kinase A, inactivating myosin light-chain kinase, activating myosin light-chain phosphatase, and finally relaxing smooth muscle in the bronchiole."
756,DB00872,"Conivaptan inhibits both isotypes of the vasopressin receptor (V1a and V2).Conivaptan is a nonpeptide, dual antagonist of arginine vasopressin (AVP) V1A and V2 receptors. The level of AVP in circulating blood is critical for the regulation of water and electrolyte balance and is usually elevated in both euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. These receptors help to maintain plasma osmolality within the normal range by increasing permeability of the renal collecting ducts to water. Vasopressin also causes vasoconstriction through its actions on vascular 1A receptors. The predominant pharmacodynamic effect of conivaptan in the treatment of hyponatremia is through its V2 antagonism of AVP in the renal collecting ducts, an effect that results in aquaresis, or excretion of free water."
757,DB00875,"It is indicated for the management of depression in adult patients who may, or may not, also be showing signs of anxiety.Flupentixol is an antipsychotic drug of the thioxanthene group. The antipsychotic actions are mainly thought to arise from cis(Z)-flupentixol, the active stereoisomer, acting as an antagonist at both dopamine D1 and D2 receptors with equal affinities. It is generally understood that positive symptoms of schizophrenia arise from a dysregulated striatal dopamine pathway, leading to hyperstimulation of D2 receptors. However, there is now evidence that antipsychotic agents can work by blocking other dopamine receptor subtypes, such as D1, D3, or D4 receptors. One study showed that cis(Z)-flupentixol is an antagonist at both dopamine D1 and D2 receptors with equal affinities, and binds to D3 and D4 receptors with lower affinities."
758,DB00876,"Also used as a first-line agent in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy, as well as a second-line agent in the treatment of congestive heart failure (only in those intolerant of ACE inhibitors).Eprosartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist used to treat hypertension. It performs 2 actions on the renin angiotensin system. By preventing the binding of angiotensin II to AT1, vascular smooth muscle relaxes and vasodilation occurs. It is responsible for effects such as vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. The resulting effect is a decrease in blood pressure.Eprosartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues (e.g., vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland)."
759,DB00877,"In Europe, it is recommended that sirolimus for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in renal transplants is used in combination with cyclosporin microemulsion and corticosteroids for two to three months. Sirolimus was first approved by the FDA in 1999 for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients aged 13 years and older receiving renal transplants. In May 2015, the FDA approved sirolimus for the treatment of patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis. FKBP12-sirolimus complex binds to and inhibits the activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase that regulates cell growth, proliferation, survival, mobility, and angiogenesis. Sirolimus inhibits the activated mTOR pathway and proliferation of alveolar smooth muscle cell proliferation."
760,DB00878,"Dental formulations, available by prescription only, include an oral rinse indicated for the treatment of gingivitis and a slow-release ""chip"" which is inserted into periodontal pockets and is indicated for the reduction of pocket depth in adult patients with periodontitis as an adjunct therapy to dental scaling and root planing procedures.Chlorhexidine is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial biguanide used as a topical antiseptic and in dental practice for the treatment of inflammatory dental conditions caused by microorganisms. Topical chlorhexidine for disinfection, as well as oral rinses for dental use, carries activity against a broad range of pathogens including bacteria, yeasts, and viruses. Dental chlorhexidine rinses may result in staining of oral surfaces, such as teeth. Allergic reactions to chlorhexidine have been associated with the development of anaphylaxis.Chlorhexidineâs broad-spectrum antimicrobial effects are due to its ability to disrupt microbial cell membranes. The specific means of cell death is dependent on the concentration of chlorhexidine - lower concentrations are bacteriostatic and result in leakage of intracellular substances such as potassium and phosphorous, whereas higher concentrations are bactericidal and cause cytoplasmic precipitation."
761,DB00879,"Emtricitabine is a cytidine analogue. Emtricitabine was granted FDA approval on 2 July 2003.Emtricitabine is a cytidine analog that competes with the natural substrate of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase to be incorporated into newly formed DNA, terminating its transcription. It is administered once daily so it has a long duration of action. Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of  lactic acidosis and hepatomegaly with steatosis.Emtricitabine is a cytidine analog which, when phosphorylated to emtricitabine 5'-triphosphate, competes with deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate for HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. Inhibition of reverse transcriptase prevents transcription of viral RNA into DNA, therefore the virus is unable to incorporate its DNA into host DNA and replicate using host cell machinery."
762,DB00880,"It is also indicated in the management of hypertension either as the sole therapeutic agent or to enhance the effectiveness of other antihypertensive drugs in the more severe forms of hypertension.A thiazide diuretic with actions and uses similar to those of hydrochlorothiazide. It inhibits Na+/Cl- reabsorption from the distal convoluted tubules in the kidneys. Thiazides also cause loss of potassium and an increase in serum uric acid. Chlorothiazide crosses the placental but not the blood-brain barrier and is excreted in breast milk.As a diuretic, chlorothiazide inhibits active chloride reabsorption at the early distal tubule via the Na-Cl cotransporter, resulting in an increase in the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water. The antihypertensive mechanism of chlorothiazide is less well understood although it may be mediated through its action on carbonic anhydrases in the smooth muscle or through its action on the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (KCa) channel, also found in the smooth muscle."
763,DB00881,"Quinapril is indicated for the treatment of hypertension and as an adjunct therapy in the treatment of heart failure. A combination tablet with  was also approved on 28 December 1999.Quinapril is a prodrug of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor used in the treatment of hypertension or adjunct in the treatment of heart failure. This action can eventually lead to myocyte hypertrophy and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. Angiotensin II also stimulates production of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), increasing the risk of thrombosis. Quinaprilat prevents the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II by inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme, and also reduces the breakdown of bradykinin."
764,DB00882,"A triphenyl ethylene stilbene derivative which is an estrogen agonist or antagonist depending on the target tissue.Clomifene (previously clomiphene) is an orally administered, non steroidal, ovulatory stimulant that acts as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). Clomifene can lead to multiple ovulation, and hence increase the risk of conceiving twins. In comparison to purified FSH, the rate of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is low. The first endocrine event, in response to a course of clomifene therapy, is an increase in the release of pituitary gonadotropins. Clomifene appears to stumulate the release of gonadotropins, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and leuteinizing hormone (LH), which leads to the development and maturation of ovarian follicle, ovulation, and subsequent development and function of the coprus luteum, thus resulting in pregnancy."
765,DB00883,"For the prevention of angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease.A vasodilator used in the treatment of angina pectoris. Its actions are similar to nitroglycerin but with a slower onset of action.Isosorbide Dinitrate is a moderate to long acting oral organic nitrate used for the relief and prophylactic management of angina pectoris. It relaxes the vascular smooth muscle and consequent dilatation of peripheral arteries and veins, especially the latter. Dilatation of the veins promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end- diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance, systolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure.Isosorbide dinitrate is converted to the active nitric oxide to activate guanylate cyclase."
766,DB00884,"Risedronic acid is indicated for the treatment of osteoperosis in men, treatment of Paget's disease, treatment and prevention of osteoperosis in postmenopausal women, and treatment and prevention of glucocorticoid-induced osteoperosis.Risedronic acid is a third generation bisphosphonate that is used for the treatment of some forms of osteoperosis and Paget's disease. It functions by preventing resorption of bone.Risedronate is a pyridine-based bisphosphonate that inhibits bone resorption caused by osteoclasts.Risedronatic acid binds to bone hydroxyapatite. Bone resorption causes local acidification, releasing risedronic acid which is that taken into osteoclasts by fluid-phase endocytosis. Endocytic vesicles are acidified, releasing risedronic acid to the cytosol of osteoclasts where they induce apoptosis through inhbition of farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase. Inhibition of osteoclasts results in decreased bone resorption."
767,DB00887,"For the treatment of edema associated with congestive heart failure, hepatic and renal disease including the nephrotic syndrome.Bumetanide  is a sulfamyl diuretic.Bumetanide is a loop diuretic of the sulfamyl category to treat heart failure. It is often used in patients in whom high doses of furosemide are ineffective. There is however no reason not to use bumetanide as a first choice drug. The main difference between the two substances is in bioavailability. Bumetanide appears to block the active reabsorption of chloride and possibly sodium in the ascending loop of Henle, altering electrolyte transfer in the proximal tubule."
768,DB00888,"For the palliative treatment of Hodgkin's disease (Stages III and IV), lymphosarcoma, chronic myelocytic or chronic lymphocytic leukemia, polycythemia vera, mycosis fungoides, and bronchogenic carcinoma. It was formerly used as a war gas. The FDA granted marketing approval for the orphan drug Valchlor (mechlorethamine) gel on August 23, 2013 for the topical treatment of stage IA and IB mycosis fungoides-type cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) in patients who have received prior skin-directed therapy. Each tube of Valchlor contains 0.016% of mechlorethamine which is equivalent to 0.02% mechlorethamine HCl.Mechlorethamine also known as mustine, nitrogen mustard, and HN2, is the prototype anticancer chemotherapeutic drug. Alkylating agents work by three different mechanisms all of which achieve the same end result - disruption of DNA function and cell death.Alkylating agents work by three different mechanisms: 1) attachment of alkyl groups to DNA bases, resulting in the DNA being fragmented by repair enzymes in their attempts to replace the alkylated bases, preventing DNA synthesis and RNA transcription from the affected DNA, 2) DNA damage via the formation of cross-links (bonds between atoms in the DNA) which prevents DNA from being separated for synthesis or transcription, and 3) the induction of mispairing of the nucleotides leading to mutations."
769,DB00889,"Granisetron has little or no affinity for other serotonin receptors, including 5-HT 1 , 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 1B/C , or 5-HT 2 ; for alpha 1 -, alpha 2 -, or beta-adrenoreceptors; for dopamine D 2 receptors; for histamine H 1 receptors; for benzodiazepine receptors; for picrotoxin receptors; or for opioid receptors. The drug is structurally and pharmacologically related to ondansetron, another selective inhibitor of 5-HT3 receptors. The serontonin 5-HT3 receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery, and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. The serotonin then stimulates the vagal and splanchnic nerve receptors that project to the medullary vomiting center, as well as the 5-HT3 receptors in the area postrema, thus initiating the vomiting reflex, causing nausea and vomiting.Granisetron is a potent, selective antagonist of 5-HT3 receptors. This inhibition of 5-HT3 receptors in turn inhibits the visceral afferent stimulation of the vomiting center, likely indirectly at the level of the area postrema, as well as through direct inhibition of serotonin activity within the area postrema and the chemoreceptor trigger zone."
770,DB00890,"For use in the treatment of atrophic vaginitis and kraurosis vulvae.Dienestrol is a synthetic, non-steroidal estrogen. Estrogens work partly by increasing a normal clear discharge from the vagina and making the vulva and urethra healthy. Using or applying an estrogen relieves or lessens: dryness and soreness in the vagina, itching, redness, or soreness of the vulva. Conditions that are treated with vaginal estrogens include a genital skin condition (vulvar atrophy), inflammation of the vagina (atrophic vaginitis), and inflammation of the urethra (atrophic urethritis).Estrogens diffuse into their target cells and interact with a protein receptor. Dienestrol is a synthetic, non-steroidal estrogen."
771,DB00891,"The sulfonamides are synthetic bacteriostatic antibiotics with a wide spectrum against most gram-positive and many gram-negative organisms. However, many strains of an individual species may be resistant. Although these drugs are no longer used to treat meningitis, CSF levels are high in meningeal infections. Their antibacterial action is inhibited by pus.Sulfapyridine is a competitive inhibitor of the bacterial enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase. The inhibited reaction is necessary in these organisms for the synthesis of folic acid by means of processing the substrate para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)."
772,DB00892,"Used to temporarily numb the front surface of the eye so that the eye pressure can be measured or a foreign body removed.Oxybuprocaine (also known as Benoxinate) is a local anesthetic, which is used especially in ophthalmology and otolaryngology. Oxybuprocaine binds to sodium channels and reversibly stabilizes the neuronal membrane which decreases its permeability to sodium ions.Oxybuprocaine is a local anaesthetic. It may be less irritating than tetracaine, and the onset and duration of action are similar to tetracaine.Oxybuprocaine binds to sodium channel and reversibly stabilizes the neuronal membrane which decreases its permeability to sodium ions. Depolarization of the neuronal membrane is inhibited thereby blocking the initiation and conduction of nerve impulses."
773,DB00893,"For treatment of patients with documented iron deficiency in whom oral administration is unsatisfactory or impossible. Iron Dextran is used for the treatment of patients with documented iron deficiency in which oral administration is unsatisfactory or impossible.Iron dextran is a dark brown, slightly viscous sterile liquid complex of ferric hydroxide and dextran for intravenous or intramuscular use. Iron is essential to the formation of hemoglobin and to the function and formation of other heme and nonheme compounds. The iron is immediately bound to the available protein moieties to form hemosiderin or ferritin, the physiological forms of iron, or to a lesser extent to transferrin. This iron which is subject to physiological control replenishes hemoglobin and depleted iron stores."
774,DB00894,"For palliative treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women.An antineoplastic agent that is a derivative of progesterone and used to treat advanced breast cancer.Testolactone is a synthetic anti-neoplastic agent that is structurally distinct from the androgen steroid nucleus in possessing a six-membered lactone ring in place of the usual five-membered carbocyclic D-ring. Despite some similarity to testosterone, testolactone has no in vivo androgenic effect. No other hormonal effects have been reported in clinical studies in patients receiving testolactone.Although the precise mechanism by which testolactone produces its clinical antineoplastic effects has not been established, its principal action is reported to be inhibition of steroid aromatase activity and consequent reduction in estrone synthesis from adrenal androstenedione, the major source of estrogen in postmenopausal women. Based on in vitro studies, the aromatase inhibition may be noncompetitive and irreversible. This phenomenon may account for the persistence of testolactone's effect on estrogen synthesis after drug withdrawal."
775,DB00895,"For use as a adjunct in assessing the risk of administering penicillin (benzylpenicillin or penicillin G).Benzylpenicilloyl polylysine is used as a skin-testing reagent to detect immunoglobulin E antibodies in people with a history of penicillin allergy. The quantitation of in vitro IgE antibodies to the benzylpenicilloyl determinant is a useful tool for evaluating allergic subjects.Benylpenicilloyl polylysine is penicilloyl bound to polylysine and is considered to be the major determinant of penicillin metabolism; it is used as a skin-testing reagent to detect immunoglobulin E antibodies in people with a history of penicillin allergy. If skin testing using benzylpenicilloyl and penicillin G (as the sole source of minor determinants) is negative, approximately 97% of patients with a negative skin test will tolerate penicillin.The skin test for penicillin demonstrates the presence or absence of specific IgE antibodies to major and minor penicillin determinants. IgE antibodies to major determinants can be detected by using benzylpenicilloyl polylysine. A penicillin skin test predicts only the presence of IgE antibodies for the major or minor penicillin determinants at the time of application and does not predict the future development of IgE-mediated reactions during subsequent courses of penicillin."
776,DB00896,"It is used to treat inflammation in the eye. Corticosteroids suppress the inflammatory response to a variety of inciting agents of a mechanical, chemical, or immunological nature. They inhibit edema, cellular infiltration, capillary dilatation, fibroblastic proliferation, deposition of collagen and scar formation associated with inflammation.Rimexolone is a glucocorticoid receptor agonist. The antiinflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition of arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. By binding to the glucocorticoid receptor, this drug ultimately leads to changes in genetic transcription involving the lipocortins and prostaglandins."
777,DB00897,"For the short-term treatment of insomnia.Withdrawn in the United Kingdom due to risk of psychiatric adverse drug reactions. Internationally, triazolam is a Schedule IV drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances.A short-acting benzodiazepine used as a hypnotic agent in the treatment of insomnia. Some countries temporarily withdrew triazolam from the market because of concerns about adverse reactions, mostly psychological, associated with higher dose ranges. Its use at lower doses with appropriate care and labeling has been reaffirmed by the FDA and most other countries. As benzodiazepine receptors are thought to be coupled to gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptors, this enhances the effects of GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA receptor."
778,DB00898,"It is widely used as a solvent and preservative in pharmaceutical preparations as well as serving as the primary ingredient in alcoholic beverages.Alcohol produces injury to cells by dehydration and precipitation of the cytoplasm or protoplasm. When alcohol is injected in close proximity to nerve tissues, it produces neuritis and nerve degeneration (neurolysis). Ninety to 98% of ethanol that enters the body is completely oxidized. Ethanol also binds to GABA, glycine, NMDA receptors and modulates their effects. Alcohol also binds directly to the receptors for acetylcholine, serotonin, GABA, and the NMDA receptors for glutamate."
779,DB00899,"For use during the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia.Remifentanil (marketed by Abbott as Ultiva) is a potent ultra short-acting synthetic opioid given to patients during surgery for pain relief and adjunctive to an anaesthetic. The opioid activity of remifentanil is antagonized by opioid antagonists such as naloxone. The analgesic effects of remifentanil are rapid in onset and offset. Remifentanil in humans has a rapid blood-brain equilibration half-time of 1 &plusmn; 1 minutes (mean &plusmn; SD) and a rapid onset of action.Remifentanil is a &micro;-opioid agonist with rapid onset and peak effect, and short duration of action. The &micro;-opioid activity of remifentanil is antagonized by opioid antagonists such as naloxone."
780,DB00900,"Didanosine is a hypoxanthine attached to the sugar ring, unlike other nucleoside analogues. Didanosine is effective against HIV, and usually used in combination with other antiviral therapy. Switching from long term AZT treatment to didanosine has been shown to be beneficial. Didanosine has weak acid stability and therefore, it is often combined with an antacid.Didanosine (ddI) is metabolized intracellularly by a series of cellular enzymes to its active moiety, dideoxyadenosine triphosphate (ddATP), which inhibits the HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme competitively by competing with natural dATP. It also acts as a chain terminator by its incorporation into viral DNA as the lack of a 3'-OH group in the incorporated nucleoside analogue prevents the formation of the 5' to 3' phosphodiester linkage essential for DNA chain elongation, and therefore, the viral DNA growth is terminated."
781,DB00902,"Used for the symptomatic relief of hypersensitivity reactions and particularly for the control of pruritic skin disordersMethdilazine is a phenothiazine compound with antihistaminic activity. Once the mast cell-antibody-antigen complex is formed, a complex series of events occurs that eventually leads to cell-degranulation and the release of histamine (and other chemical mediators) from the mast cell or basophil. Once released, histamine can react with local or widespread tissues through histamine receptors. Histamine, acting on H1-receptors, produces pruritis, vasodilatation, hypotension, flushing, headache, tachycardia, and bronchoconstriction. Histamine also increases vascular permeability and potentiates pain."
782,DB00903,"This pharmacological action results in excretion of these ions, increased urinary output, and reduction in extracellular fluid. Ethacrynic acid acts on the ascending limb of the loop of Henle and on the proximal and distal tubules. Ethacrynic acid has little or no effect on glomerular filtration or on renal blood flow, except following pronounced reductions in plasma volume when associated with rapid diuresis.Ethacrynic acid inhibits symport of sodium, potassium, and chloride primarily in the ascending limb of Henle, but also in the proximal and distal tubules. This pharmacological action results in excretion of these ions, increased urinary output, and reduction in extracellular fluid. Diuretics also lower blood pressure initially by reducing plasma and extracellular fluid volume; cardiac output also decreases, explaining its antihypertensive action."
783,DB00904,"In the adult patient population:  i) orally administered ondansetron tablets and orally disintegrating tablets (ODT) are indicated for:  - the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including high dose (ie. It is effective in the treatment of nausea and vomiting caused by cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs, including cisplatin, and has reported anxiolytic and neuroleptic properties. The serotonin then stimulates the vagal and splanchnic nerve receptors that project to the medullary vomiting center, as well as the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors in the area postrema, thus initiating the vomiting reflex, causing nausea and vomiting , . At the highest tested dose of 32 mg, prolongation of the Fridericia-corrected QTc interval (QT/RR0.33=QTcF) was observed from 15 min to 4 h after the start of the 15 min infusion, with a maximum mean (upper limit of 90% CI) difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline-correction of 19.6 (21.5) msec at 20 min . Cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy are associated with the release of serotonin (5-HT) from enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine, presumably initiating a vomiting reflex through stimulation of 5-HT3 receptors located on vagal afferents ."
784,DB00905,"Bimatoprost is used for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Bimatoprost rapidly decreases intraocular pressure and reduces the risk for visual field loss from ocular hypertension due to various causes. Patients should be informed of these possible effects, especially if this drug is only administered to one eye, which may noticeably change in appearance with bimatoprost treatment.Bimatoprost imitates the effects of prostamides, specifically prostaglandin F2Î±. Bimatoprost mildly stimulates aqueous humor outflow, relieving elevated intraocular pressure and decreasing the risk of optic nerve damage. It achieves the above effects by decreasing tonographic resistance to aqueous humor outflow."
785,DB00906,"For the treatment of partial seizuresTiagabine is an anti-convulsive medication. Though the exact mechanism by which tiagabine exerts its effect on the human body is unknown, it does appear to operate as a selective GABA reuptake inhibitor.Tiagabine is used primarily as an anticonvulsant for the adjunctive treatment of epilepsy. The precise mechanism by which Tiagabine exerts its antiseizure effect is unknown, although it is believed to be related to its ability to enhance the activity of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Tiagabine binds to recognition sites associated with the GABA uptake carrier. It is thought that, by this action, Tiagabine blocks GABA uptake into presynaptic neurons, permitting more GABA to be available for receptor binding on the surfaces of post-synaptic cells.Though the exact mechanism by which Tiagabine exerts its effect on the human body is unknown, it does appear to operate as a selective GABA reuptake inhibitor."
786,DB00907,"It is a local anesthetic and vasoconstrictor and is clinically used for that purpose, particularly in the eye, ear, nose, and throat. Cocaine, like amphetamines, acts by multiple mechanisms on brain catecholaminergic neurons; the mechanism of its reinforcing effects is thought to involve inhibition of dopamine uptake.Cocaine is a local anesthetic indicated for the introduction of local (topical) anesthesia of accessible mucous membranes of the oral, laryngeal and nasal cavities.Cocaine produces anesthesia by inhibiting excitation of nerve endings or by blocking conduction in peripheral nerves. This is achieved by reversibly binding to and inactivating sodium channels. Cocaine is the only local anesthetic with vasoconstrictive properties. This is a result of its blockade of norepinephrine reuptake in the autonomic nervous system."
787,DB00908,"Quinidine is considered the first antiarrhythmic drug (class Ia) and is moderately efficacious in the acute conversion of atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm. It prolongs cellular action potential by blocking sodium and potassium currents. However, it continues to be used in the treatment of Brugada syndrome, short QT syndrome and idiopathic ventricular fibrillation.Quinidine is an antimalarial schizonticide, and a class Ia antiarrhythmic agent used to interrupt or prevent reentrant arrhythmias and arrhythmias due to increased automaticity, such as atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Quinidine also causes a marked prolongation of the QT interval in a dose-related manner, acts peripherally as an Î±-adrenergic antagonist, and has anticholinergic and negative inotropic activity. Patients treated with quinidine may also be at risk of a paradoxical increase in ventricular rate in atrial flutter/fibrillation, and patients with sick sinus syndrome treated with quinidine may develop marked sinus node depression and bradycardia.Quinidine has a complex electrophysiological profile that has not been fully elucidated."
788,DB00909,"Zonisamide oral suspension is indicated as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in adults and pediatric patients 16 years of age and older.Zonisamide is a sulfonamide anticonvulsant used as an adjunctive therapy in adults with partial-onset seizures. This latter action may inhibit the uptake of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA while enhancing the uptake of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. In 1989, it was approved for commercial use in Japan. Zonisamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, which may lead to metabolic acidosis in patients treated with this drug. However, its antiepileptic properties may be due to its effects on sodium and calcium channels."
789,DB00910,"Paricalcitol is indicated for the prevention and treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with chronic renal failure.Secondary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by an elevation in parathyroid hormone (PTH) associated with inadequate levels of active vitamin D hormone. The source of vitamin D in the body is from synthesis in the skin and from dietary intake. Vitamin D requires two sequential hydroxylations in the liver and the kidney to bind to and to activate the vitamin D receptor (VDR). In the diseased kidney, the activation of vitamin D is diminished, resulting in a rise of PTH, subsequently leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism and disturbances in the calcium and phosphorus homeostasis.1 Decreased levels of 1,25(OH)2 D3 have been observed in early stages of chronic kidney disease. An in vitro study indicates that paricalcitol is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 or CYP3A at concentrations up to 50 nM (21 ng/mL).Paricalcitol is a synthetic, biologically active vitamin D analog of calcitriol with modifications to the side chain (D2) and the A (19-nor) ring."
790,DB00911,"Tinidazole demonstrates activity both in vitro and in clinical infections against the following protozoa: Trichomonas vaginalis, Giardia duodenalis (also termed G. lamblia), and Entamoeba histolytica. Tinidazole does not appear to have activity against most strains of vaginal lactobacilli.Tinidazole is a prodrug and antiprotozoal agent. The nitro group of tinidazole is reduced in Trichomonas by a ferredoxin-mediated electron transport system. The free nitro radical generated as a result of this reduction is believed to be responsible for the antiprotozoal activity. It is suggested that the toxic free radicals covalently bind to DNA, causing DNA damage and leading to cell death."
791,DB00912,"As an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Membrane potential is regulated through an inverse relationship between the activity of cell membrane ATP-sensitive potassium channels (ABCC8) and extracellular glucose concentrations. Once inside the cell, glucose is metabolized to produce ATP. Repaglinide activity is dependent on the presence functioning &beta; cells and glucose. The insulinotropic effects of repaglinide are highest at intermediate glucose levels (3 to 10 mmol/L) and it does not increase insulin release already stimulated by high glucose concentrations (greater than 15 mmol/L)."
792,DB00913,"For treatment and management of pain (systemic) and for use as an anesthesia adjunct.Anileridine is a synthetic opioid and strong analgesic medication. It is a narcotic pain reliever used to treat moderate to severe pain. Narcotic analgesics act in the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain. It may also be used as an analgesic adjunct in general anesthesia in the same manner as meperidine to reduce the amount of anesthetic needed, to facilitate relaxation, and to reduce laryngospasm. Anileridine's main pharmacologic action is exerted on the CNS."
793,DB00914,"For the reatment of type II diabetes mellitus.A biguanide hypoglycemic agent with actions and uses similar to those of metformin. Although it is generally considered to be associated with an unacceptably high incidence of lactic acidosis, often fatal, it is still available in some countries. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p290)Used to treat diabetes, phenformin is a biguanide (contains 2 guanidino groups) hypoglycemic agent with actions and uses similar to those of metformin (Glucophage). Both drugs work by (1) decreasing the absorption of glucose by the intestines, (2) decreasing the production of glucose in the liver, and by (3) increasing the body's ability to use insulin more effectively. Phenformin is generally considered to be associated with an unacceptably high incidence of actic acidosis."
794,DB00915,"Also for the treatment of parkinsonism and drug-induced extrapyramidal reactions.An antiviral that is used in the prophylactic or symptomatic treatment of influenza A. It is also used as an antiparkinsonian agent, to treat extrapyramidal reactions, and for postherpetic neuralgia. The mechanisms of its effects in movement disorders are not well understood but probably reflect an increase in synthesis and release of dopamine, with perhaps some inhibition of dopamine uptake.Amantadine is an antiviral drug which also acts as an antiparkinson agent, for which it is usually combined with L-DOPA when L-DOPA responses decline (probably due to tolerance). It is a derivate of adamantane, like a similar drug rimantadine. It has been shown to cause an increase in dopamine release in the animal brain, and does not possess anticholinergic activity.The mechanism of its antiparkinsonic effect is not fully understood, but it appears to be releasing dopamine from the nerve endings of the brain cells, together with stimulation of norepinephrine response."
795,DB00916,"Metronidazole is indicated for the treatment of confirmed trichomoniasis caused by Trichomonas vaginalis (except for in the first trimester of pregnancy) and the patient's sexual partners, bacterial vaginosis, certain types of amebiasis, and various anaerobic infections. It is frequently used to treat gastrointestinal infections as well as trichomoniasis and giardiasis, and amebiasis which are parasitic infections. Metronidazole is an effective treatment for some anaerobic bacterial infections. Following this, ferredoxin or flavodoxin reduce its nitro group to nitro radicals. These include N-(2-hydroxyethyl) oxamic acid and acetamide, which may damage DNA of replicating organisms."
796,DB00917,"Also used in the management of nonmetastatic gestational trophoblastic disease (benign hydatidiform mole). It also stimulates osteoblasts to release factors which stimualtes bone resorption by osteoclasts. As a prescription drug it is used as a vaginal suppository, to prepare the cervix for labour and to induce labour.Dinoprostone is equivalent to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). It stimulates labor and delivery by stimulating the uterine, and thus terminates pregnancy. The exact mechanism of action for this effect is also unknown, but it has been suggested that this effect may be associated with collagen degradation caused by secretion of the enzyme collagenase as a partial response to locally administered dinoprostone."
797,DB00918,"It works by narrowing blood vessels in the brain, stopping pain signals from being sent to the brain, and stopping the release of certain natural substances that cause pain, nausea, and other symptoms of migraine. Almotriptan does not prevent migraine attacks.Almotriptan is a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor subtype agonist indicated for the acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without aura in adults. Almotriptan is not intended for the prophylactic therapy of migraine or for use in the management of hemiplegic or basilar migraine. This action in humans correlates with the relief of migraine headache. In addition to causing vasoconstriction, experimental data from animal studies show that Almotriptan also activates 5-HT1 receptors on peripheral terminals of the trigeminal nerve innervating cranial blood vessels, which may also contribute to the antimigrainous effect of Almotriptan in humans.Almotriptan binds with high affinity to human 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors leading to cranial blood vessel constriction."
798,DB00919,For use in the treatment of acute gonorrheal urethritis and proctitis in the male and acute gonorrheal cervicitis and proctitis in the female when due to susceptible strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae.An antibiotic produced by Streptomyces spectabilis. It is active against gram-negative bacteria and used for the treatment of gonorrhea.Spectinomycin is an aminocyclitol antibiotic produced by a species of soil microorganism designated as Streptomyces spectabilis. In vitro studies have shown spectinomycin to be active against most strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (minimum inhibitory concentration <7.5 to 20 mcg/mL). Footprint studies indicate that spectinomycin exerts regional effects on ribosomal structure.Spectinomycin is an inhibitor of protein synthesis in the bacterial cell; the site of action is the 30S ribosomal subunit. It is bactericidal in its action.
799,DB00920,"Administered orally, ketotifen is indicated as an add-on medication in the chronic treatment of mild atopic asthma in children. It is also available as an over-the-counter ophthalmic solution which is indicated for the temporary prevention of itching of the eye due to allergic conjunctivitis.Ketotifen is a benzocycloheptathiophene derivative with potent antihistaminic and mast cell stabilizing properties. It has a similar structure to some other first-generation antihistamines such as  and . In the US, it is now used in an over-the-counter ophthalmic formulation for the treatment of itchy eyes associated with allergies, and in Canada a prescription-only oral formulation is available and indicated as an add-on therapy for children with atopic asthma. In addition, oral ketotifen is used in Mexico and across Europe for the treatment of various allergic symptoms and disorders, including urticaria, mastocytosis, and food allergy.Ketotifen is a non-competitive histamine antagonist and mast cell stabilizer."
800,DB00921,"It is also commonly used as an alternative to  for the treatment of severe opioid addiction. **Withdrawal**    Abrupt discontinuation of treatment is not recommended as it may result in an opioid withdrawal syndrome that may be delayed in onset. **Precipitation of Opioid Withdrawal Signs and Symptoms**    If buprenorphine is started in opioid-dependent individuals, it will displace the other opioids and cause a phenomenon known as ""precipitated withdrawal"" which is characterized by a rapid and intense onset of withdrawal symptoms. Buprenorphine/naloxone products may be used with caution for maintenance treatment in patients with moderate hepatic impairment who have initiated treatment on a buprenorphine product without naloxone. Buprenorphine's high affinity, but low intrinsic activity for the mu-opioid receptor also means that if it is started in opioid-dependent individuals, it will displace the other opioids without creating an equal opioid effect and cause a phenomenon known as ""precipitated withdrawal"" which is characterized by a rapid and intense onset of withdrawal symptoms (i.e. anxiety, restlessness, gastrointestinal distress, diaphoresis, intense drug cravings, and tachycardia)."
801,DB00922,"For short term treatment of acutely decompensated severe chronic heart failure (CHF). This increases contractility without raising calcium levels. Levosimendan has not been approved for use in the U.S. or Canada.Levosimendan appears to increase myofilament calcium sensitivity by binding to cardiac troponin C in a calcium-dependent manner. This stabilizes the calcium-induced conformational change of troponin C, thereby (1) changing actin-myosin cross-bridge kinetics apparently without increasing the cycling rate of the cross-bridges or myocardial ATP consumption, (2) increasing the effects of calcium on cardiac myofilaments during systole and (3) improving contraction at low energy cost (inotropic effect). Levosimendan also has a selective phosphodiesterase (PDE)-III inhibitory action that may contribute to the inotropic effect of this compound under certain experimental conditions."
802,DB00923,"For the treatment of infections caused by susceptible organisms.Ceforanide is administered parenterally. It has a longer elimination half-life than any currently available cephalosporin. Its activity is very similar to that of cefamandole, another second-generation cephalosporin antibiotic, except that ceforanide is less active against most gram-positive organisms. Many coliforms, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Proteus, are susceptible to ceforanide, as are most strains of Salmonella, Shigella, Hemophilus, Citrobacter and Arizona species.Ceforanide is a semisynthetic second-generation cephalosporin. The cephalosporins are bactericidal drugs with both gram-positive and gram-negative activity."
803,DB00924,"It has not been found effective in the treatment of spasticity originating from cerebral or spinal cord disease, or spasticity in children with cerebral palsy. It was initially studied for use as antidepressant given its structural similarity to tricyclic antidepressants - it differs from  by only a single double bond. Since its approval, it has remained relatively popular as an adjunctive, short-term treatment for acute skeletal muscle spasms secondary to musculoskeletal injury.Cyclobenzaprine is a skeletal muscle relaxant that works on areas of the brainstem to reduce skeletal muscle spasm, though its exact pharmacodynamic behaviour is currently unclear. Despite its long half-life, it is relatively short-acting with a typical duration of action of 4-6 hours. More recently it has been suggested that inhibition of descending serotonergic pathways in the spinal cord via action on 5-HT2 receptors may contribute to cyclobenzaprineâs observed effects."
804,DB00925,"For the treatment of phaeochromocytoma (malignant), benign prostatic hypertrophy and malignant essential hypertension.An alpha-adrenergic antagonist with long duration of action. It has been used to treat hypertension and as a peripheral vasodilator.Phenoxybenzamine is indicated for the control of episodes of hypertension and sweating that occur with a disease called pheochromocytoma. Phenoxybenzamine works by blocking alpha receptors in certain parts of the body. Alpha receptors are present in the muscle that lines the walls of blood vessels. This widening of the blood vessels results in a lowering of blood pressure.Phenoxybenzamine produces its therapeutic actions by blocking alpha receptors, leading to a muscle relaxation and a widening of the blood vessels."
805,DB00927,"Off-label uses of famotidine include the reduction of NSAIDs-associated gastrointestinal effects, treatment of refractory urticarial, prevention of stress ulcer in critically-ill patients, and symptomatic relief of gastritis.Famotidine is a competitive histamine-2 (H2) receptor antagonist that works to inhibit gastric acid secretion. It is commonly used in gastrointestinal conditions related to acid secretion, such as gastric ulcers and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), in adults and children. The duration of effect is about 10-12 hours.Histamine acts as a local hormone that stimulates the acid output by parietal cells via a paracrine mechanism. Gastrin (G) cells release gastrin, which works on CCK2 receptors on ECL cells. This action promotes the release of histamine from ECL cells."
806,DB00928,"As an analogue of cytidine, it is able to incorporate into RNA and DNA, disrupting RNA metabolism and inhibiting protein and DNA synthesis. The other one is through the inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, impairing DNA methylation. Due to its anti-neoplastic activity and its ability to inhibit methylation in replicating DNA, azacytidine has been used mainly used in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), two types of cancer characterized by the presence of aberrant DNA methylation. The use of oral azacitidine for the treatment of AML in patients in complete remission was approved by the FDA in September 2020.The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis, and hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes critical for differentiation and proliferation. On the other hand, the incorporation of azacitidine into RNA and DNA leads to cytotoxicity as follows: Following cellular uptake, azacitidine is phosphorylated by uridine-cytidine kinase to form 5-azacytidine monophosphate."
807,DB00929,"Misoprostol is indicated as a tablet to reduce the risk of NSAID induced gastric ulcers but not duodenal ulcers in high risk patients. Misoprostol is used off label for the management of miscarriages, prevention of post partum hemorrhage, and is also used alone or in combination with mifepristone in other countries for first trimester abortions.Misoprostol is a prostaglandin analog used to reduce the risk of NSAID related ulcers, manage miscarriages, prevent post partum hemorrhage, and also for first trimester abortions. Misoprostol is also used to manage miscarriages and used alone or in combination with mifepristone for first trimester abortions. An oral dose of misoprostol has an 8 minute onset of action and a duration of action of approximately 2 hours, a sublingual dose has an 11 minute onset of action and a duration of action of approximately 3 hours, a vaginal dose has a 20 minute onset of action and a duration of action of approximately 4 hours, and a rectal dose has a 100 minute onset of action and a duration of action of approximately 4 hours.Misoprostol is a synthetic prostaglandin E1 analog that stimulates prostaglandin E1 receptors on parietal cells in the stomach to reduce gastric acid secretion. Misoprostol binds to smooth muscle cells in the uterine lining to increase the strength and frequency of contractions as well as degrade collagen and reduce cervical tone."
808,DB00930,"Colesevelam is a bile acid sequestrant. Colesevelam binds to bile acids in the intestine which reduces the amount of bile acids that are returned to the liver via enterohepatic circulation. Similarly, decreased levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Epidemiological investigations have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the levels of total-C and LDL-C, and inversely with the level of HDL-C. The combination of colesevelam and an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor is effective in further lowering serum total-C and LDL-C levels beyond that achieved by either agent alone.Colesevelam binds bile acids in the intestine and prevents their reabsorption."
809,DB00931,"For the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitisA broad-spectrum semisynthetic antibiotic related to tetracycline but excreted more slowly and maintaining effective blood levels for a more extended period.Methacycline is a tetracycline antibiotic. It is active against most Gram-positive bacteria (pneumococci, streptococci, staphylococci) and Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, salmonella, shigella, etc. ), and towards agents causing onithosis, psittacosis, trachoma, and some Protozoa. Like other tetracyclines, the general usefulness of methacycline has been reduced with the onset of bacterial resistance.Methacycline, a tetracycline antibiotic, is a protein synthesis inhibitors, inhibiting the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex. Tetracyclines also have been found to inhibit matrix metalloproteinases."
810,DB00932,"Tipranavir is a non-peptidic protease inhibitor (PI) of HIV. Nelfinavir binds to the protease active site and inhibits the activity of the enzyme. This inhibition prevents cleavage of the viral polyproteins resulting in the formation of immature non-infectious viral particles. Protease inhibitors are almost always used in combination with at least two other anti-HIV drugs.Tipranavir (TPV) is a non-peptidic HIV-1 protease inhibitor that inhibits the processing of the viral Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins in HIV-1 infected cells, thus preventing formation of mature virions. Tipravanir may bind to the active site of the protease enzyme with fewer hydrogen bonds than peptidic protease inhibitors, which results in increased flexibility, allowing it to fit into the active site of the enzyme in viruses that have become resistance to other protease inhibitors."
811,DB00933,"Used in the treatment of schizophrenia, organic brain disorders, alcoholism and psychoneuroses.A phenothiazine antipsychotic with effects similar to chlorpromazine.Mesoridazine, the besylate salt of a metabolite of thioridazine, is a phenothiazine tranquilizer. Pharmacological studies in laboratory animals have established that mesoridazine has a spectrum of pharmacodynamic actions typical of a major tranquilizer. It is effective in blocking spinal reflexes in the cut and antagonizes d-amphetamine excitation and toxicity in grouped mice. Intravenously administered, it lowers the blood pressure of anesthetized dogs. It has a weak antiacetylcholine effect in vitro.Based upon animal studies, mesoridazine, as with other phenothiazines, acts indirectly on reticular formation, whereby neuronal activity into reticular formation is reduced without affecting its intrinsic ability to activate the cerebral cortex."
812,DB00934,"For treatment of depression, including the depressed phase of bipolar depression, psychotic depression, and involutional melancholia, and may also be helpful in treating certain patients suffering severe depressive neurosis.Maprotiline is a tetracyclic antidepressant with similar pharmacological properties to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Although its main therapeutic use is in the treatment of depression, it has also been shown to exert a sedative effect on the anxiety component that often accompanies depression. Maprotiline is a strong inhibitor of noradrenaline reuptake in the brain and peripheral tissues, however it is worthy to note that it is a weak inhibitor of serotonergic uptake. In addition, it displays strong antihistaminic action (which may explain its sedative effects) as well as weak anticholinergic action. Maprotiline is also a moderate peripheral &alpha;1 adrenergic antagonist, which may explain the occasional orthostatic hypotension reported in association with its use."
813,DB00935,"Oxymetazoline is indicated for the topical treatment of persistent facial erythema associated with rosacea in adults. As an effective decongestant, oxymetazoline is available in over-the-counter intranasal sprays used to relieve nasal and sinus congestion caused by a wide variety of conditions, such as common cold, hay fever, and upper respiratory allergies. In July 2020, the FDA approved the use of an ophthalmic formulation of oxymetazoline (Upneeq) in adults with acquired blepharoptosis, or ptosis, making it the first FDA-approved medical treatment for this medical condition.Oxymetazoline is an adrenergic Î±1- and Î±2-agonist and a direct-acting sympathomimetic drug. In blepharoptosis, it is hypothesized that oxymetazoline works by stimulating Î±-adrenergic receptors on the MÃ¼ller muscle that elevates the upper eyelid, causing muscle contraction. Oxymetazoline relieves nasal congestion by vasoconstricting the respiratory microvasculature, in both resistance and capacitance blood vessels on the human nasal mucosa, leading to decreased nasal mucosal blood flow, edema, and airflow resistance."
814,DB00936,"Its salts, the salicylates, are used as analgesics.Salicylic acid treats acne by causing skin cells to slough off more readily, preventing pores from clogging up. Salicylic acid is a key ingredient in many skin-care products for the treatment of acne, psoriasis, calluses, corns, keratosis pilaris, and warts. Because of its effect on skin cells, salicylic acid is used in several shampoos used to treat dandruff. Salicylic acid is also used as an active ingredient in gels which remove verrucas (plantar warts). It also competitively inhibits the transferring of the glucuronyl group of uridine-5-phosphoglucuronic acid (UDPGA) to a phenolic acceptor."
815,DB00937,"Used in the management of exogenous obesity as a short-term adjunct (a few weeks) in a regimen of weight reduction based on caloric restriction.A appetite depressant considered to produce less central nervous system disturbance than most drugs in this therapeutic category. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1994, p2290)Diethylpropion is a sympathomimetic stimulant drug marketed as an appetite suppressant. Chemically, it is the N,N-diethyl analog of cathinone. It is theorized that diethylpropion can raise levels of leptin which signal satiety. It is also theorized that increased levels of the catecholamines are partially responsible for halting another chemical messenger known as neuropeptide Y."
816,DB00938,"It has a longer duration of action than the short-acting beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist, . Salmeterol was granted FDA approval on 4 February 1994.Salmeterol is a long acting beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist that binds to both the active and exo sites of the beta-2 adrenergic receptor. Patients should be counselled regarding the risks of long acting beta agonist (LABA) monotherapy, hypokalemia, hypoglycemia, and not to take this drug with another LABA.Beta-2 adrenoceptor stimulation causes relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle, bronchodilation, and increased airflow. Salmeterol is hypothesized to bind to 2 sites on the beta-2 adrenoceptor. The hydrophilic tail of salmeterol binds to leucine residues in the exo-site of the beta-2 adrenoceptor almost irreversibly, allowing salmeterol to persist in the active site, which is responsible for it's long duration of action."
817,DB00939,"For the relief of mild to moderate pain, for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea and for the treatment of idiopathic heavy menstrual blood loss. Also for relief of the signs and symptoms of acute and chronic rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent with antipyretic and antigranulation activities. It also inhibits prostaglandin biosynthesis.Meclofenamic acid is a nonsteroidal agent which has demonstrated anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activity in laboratory animals.The mode of action, like that of other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, is not known. Therapeutic action does not result from pituitary-adrenal stimulation. In vitro meclofenamic acid was found to be an inhibitor of human leukocyte 5-lipoxygenase activity."
818,DB00940,"Methantheline is used to treat intestine or stomach ulcers (peptic ulcer disease), intestine problems (irritable bowel syndrome), pancreatitis, gastritis, biliary dyskinesia, pylorosplasm, or urinary problems (reflex neurogenic bladder in children).Methantheline is a synthetic quarternary ammonium antimuscarinic used to relieve cramps or spasms of the stomach, intestines, and bladder. It can be used together with antacids or other medicines, such as H2-receptor antagonists, in the treatment of peptic ulcer. Methantheline inhibits muscarinic actions at postganglionic parasympathetic neuroeffector sites.Methantheline inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves as well as on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. These postganglionic receptor sites are present in the autonomic effector cells of the smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, and exocrine glands. Depending on the dose, anticholinergics may reduce the motility and secretory activity of the gastrointestinal system, and the tone of the ureter and urinary bladder and may have a slight relaxant action on the bile ducts and gallbladder."
819,DB00941,Used as an adjunct with succinylcholine (or suxamethonium chloride) to prolong muscle relaxation and to prevent succinylcholine-induced muscle fasciculations.Hexafluronium bromide is a neuromuscular blocking agent used in anesthesiology to prolong and potentiate the skeletal muscle relaxing action of suxamethonium during surgery. There are two types of cholinesterase acetylcholinesterase and pseuodocholinesterase. The first hydrolyses acetylcholine more quickly; the latter hydrolyses butyrylcholine and succinylcholine more quickly. This is a silent condition that only manifests itself when people who have the deficiency receive the muscle relaxants succinylcholine or mivacurium during a surgery.Hexafluronium bromide is a non-competitive reversible inhibitor of human plasma cholinesterase or pseudocholinesterase. The esteratic site on cholistereases is where acetylcholine is hydrolyzed to acetic acid and choline.
820,DB00942,"For treatment and management of Parkinson's disease.Cycrimine is a drug used to reduce levels of acetylcholine to return a balance with dopamine in the treatment and management of Parkinson's disease.Cycrimine is a central anticholenergic used in the treatment of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. It is a drug used to reduce levels of acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is usually in balance with dopamine neurotransmitters, however lower levels of dopamine are present in the brain of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease. By lowering levels of acetylcholine, it is thought that this balance may be restored.Cycrimine binds the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1, effectively inhibiting acetylcholine. This decrease in acetylcholine restores the normal dopamine-acetylcholine balance and relieves the symptoms of Parkinson's disease."
821,DB00943,"For the treatment of Human immunovirus (HIV) infections in conjunction with other antivirals.A dideoxynucleoside compound in which the 3'-hydroxyl group on the sugar moiety has been replaced by a hydrogen. This modification prevents the formation of 5' to 3' phosphodiester linkages, which are needed for the elongation of DNA chains, thus resulting in the termination of viral DNA growth. Its principal toxic side effect is axonal degeneration resulting in peripheral neuropathy.Zalcitabine is an analog of 2'-deoxycytidine that is pharmacologically related to but structurally different from other nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Within cells, zalcitabine is converted to its active metabolite, dideoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate (ddCTP), by the sequential action of cellular enzymes. ddCTP interferes with viral RNA-directed DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase) by competing for utilization of the natural substrate deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate (dCTP), as well as incorpating into viral DNA."
822,DB00944,"For the topical treatment of chronic open-angle glaucoma.Demecarium is an indirect-acting parasympathomimetic agent that is used to treat glaucoma. It is a cholinesterase inhibitor or an anticholinesterase. Cholinesterase inhibitors prolong the effect of acetylcholine, which is released at the neuroeffector junction of parasympathetic postganglion nerves, by inactivating the cholinesterases that break it down. The outflow of the aqueous humor is facilitated, which leads to a reduction in intraocular pressure.Demecarium is a long-acting cholinesterase inhibitor and potent miotic. In the eye, this causes constriction of the iris sphincter muscle (causing miosis) and the ciliary muscle (affecting the accommodation reflex and causing a spasm of the focus to near vision)."
823,DB00945,"Additionally, the extended-release form is used to decrease the risk of death and recurrent episodes of stroke in patients with a history of stroke or TIA . Also known as _Aspirin_, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) is a commonly used drug for the treatment of pain and fever due to various causes. This drug also inhibits platelet aggregation and is used in the prevention of blood clots stroke, and myocardial infarction (MI) . Prostaglandins increase the sensitivity of pain receptors and substances such as histamine and bradykinin. **Effects on platelet aggregation**    The inhibition of platelet aggregation by ASA occurs because of its interference with thromboxane A2 in platelets, caused by COX-1 inhibition."

825,DB00947,"Fulvestrant is a drug treatment of hormone receptor (HR)-positive metastatic breast cancer in post-menopausal women with disease progression following anti-estrogen therapy. It is an estrogen receptor antagonist with no agonist effects, which works both by down-regulating and by degrading the estrogen receptor.Fulvestrant competitively and reversibly binds to estrogen receptors present in cancer cells and achieves its anti-estrogen effects through two separate mechanisms. First, fulvestrant binds to the receptors and downregulates them so that estrogen is no longer able to bind to these receptors. Second, fulvestrant degrades the estrogen receptors to which it is bound. Both of these mechanisms inhibit the growth of tamoxifen-resistant as well as estrogen-sensitive human breast cancer cell lines."
826,DB00948,"Used to treat serious gram&ndash;negative infections of the lungs, urinary tract, and skin.Semisynthetic ampicillin-derived acylureido penicillin. It has been proposed for infections with certain anaerobes and may be useful in inner ear, bile, and CNS infections.Mezlocillin is a penicillin beta-lactam antibiotic used in the treatment of bacterial infections caused by susceptible, usually gram-positive, organisms. Mezlocillin has <i>in vitro</i> activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The bactericidal activity of mezlocillin results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis and is mediated through mezlocillin binding to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). Mezlocillin is stable against hydrolysis by a variety of beta-lactamases, including penicillinases, and cephalosporinases and extended spectrum beta-lactamases."
827,DB00949,"In particular, in the adult patient population, it can be employed to treat partial seizures (with and without generalization). Alternatively, it is used to treat partial and generalized seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in children. It has a weak inhibitory effect on GABA receptor binding sites.Felbamate is an antiepileptic indicated as monotherapy or as an adjunct to other anticonvulsants for the treatment of partial seizures resulting from epilepsy. Receptor-binding studies <i>in vitro</i> indicate that felbamate has weak inhibitory effects on GABA-receptor binding, benzodiazepine receptor binding, and is devoid of activity at the MK-801 receptor binding site of the NMDA receptor-ionophore complex. However, felbamate does interact as an antagonist at the strychnine-insensitive glycine recognition site of the NMDA receptor-ionophore complex.The mechanism by which felbamate exerts its anticonvulsant activity is unknown, but in animal test systems designed to detect anticonvulsant activity, felbamate has properties in common with other marketed anticonvulsants."
828,DB00950,"Fexofenadine is also available in combination with  for the symptomatic treatment of season allergic rhinitis in patients â¥12 years old.Fexofenadine is an over-the-counter second-generation antihistamine used in the treatment of various allergic symptoms. It is selective for the H1 receptor, carries little-to-no activity at off-targets, and does not cross the blood-brain barrier - this is in contrast to previous first-generation antihistamines, such as , which readily bind to off-targets that contribute to side effects such as sedation. Fexofenadine is the major active metabolite of  and is administered as a racemic mixture in which both enantiomers display approximately equivalent antihistamine activity.Fexofenadine relieves allergy symptoms by antagonizing the actions of histamine, an endogenous compound predominantly responsible for allergic symptomatology. The relatively long duration of action of fexofenadine (approximately 24 hours) allows for once or twice daily dosing, and its rapid absorption allows for an onset of action within 1-3 hours. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells."
829,DB00951,"It remains the treatment of choice for tuberculosis.Isoniazid is a bactericidal agent active against organisms of the genus Mycobacterium, specifically M. tuberculosis, M. bovis and M. kansasii. Isoniazid is bactericidal when mycobacteria grow rapidly and bacteriostatic when they grow slowly.Isoniazid is a prodrug and must be activated by bacterial catalase. Specficially, activation is associated with reduction of the mycobacterial ferric KatG catalase-peroxidase by hydrazine and reaction with oxygen to form an oxyferrous enzyme complex. Once activated, isoniazid inhibits the synthesis of mycoloic acids, an essential component of the bacterial cell wall. Specifically isoniazid inhibits InhA, the enoyl reductase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, by forming a covalent adduct with the NAD cofactor."
830,DB00952,"For the acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without aura in adults.Naratriptan is a triptan drug that is selective for the 5-hydroxytryptamine1 receptor subtype. It is typically used for the treatment of migraine headaches.Naratriptan is a selective agonist of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) type 1B and 1D receptors. Naratriptan has only a weak affinity for 5-HT1A, 5-HT5A, and 5-HT7 receptors and no significant affinity or pharmacological activity at 5-HT2, 5-HT3 or 5-HT4 receptor subtypes or at alpha1-, alpha2-, or beta-adrenergic, dopamine1,; dopamine2; muscarinic, or benzodiazepine receptors. This action in humans correlates with the relief of migraine headache. In addition to causing vasoconstriction, experimental data from animal studies show that Naratriptan also activates 5-HT1 receptors on peripheral terminals of the trigeminal nerve innervating cranial blood vessels, which may also contribute to the antimigrainous effect of Naratriptan in humans.Three distinct pharmacological actions have been implicated in the antimigraine effect of the triptans: (1) stimulation of presynaptic 5-HT1D receptors, which serves to inhibit both dural vasodilation and inflammation; (2) direct inhibition of trigeminal nuclei cell excitability via 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonism in the brainstem and (3) vasoconstriction of meningeal, dural, cerebral or pial vessels as a result of vascular 5-HT1B receptor agonism."
831,DB00953,"Used in the treatment of migraines, rizatriptan was first approved in the US in 1998. Activation of the trigeminovascular system leads to the release of vasoactive neuropeptides (such as substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and neurokinin A) from the trigeminal nerve innervating the intracranial vessels and dura mater. An imbalance in serotonin (5-HT) levels has also been documented: 5-HT binds to 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors to promote trigeminal neuronal firing and vasoconstriction. Rizatriptan causes vasoconstriction of intracranial extracerebral blood vessels, which is thought to occur primarily via 5-HT1B receptors. It attenuates the release of vasoactive neuropeptides by the trigeminal nerve, which is thought to occur via neurogenic and central 5-HT1D receptors."
832,DB00955,"Netilmicin inhibits protein synthesis in susceptible organisms by binding to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit and interfering with mRNA binding and the acceptor tRNA site. The bactericidal effect of netilmiicin is not fully understood.Netilmicin is a semisynthetic, water soluble antibiotic of the aminoglycoside group, produced by the fermentation of Micromonospora inyoensis, a species of actinomycete. Shigella sp. Many strains of the above organisms which are found to be resistant to other aminoglycosides, such as kanamycin, gentamicin, tobramycin and sisomicin, are susceptible to netilmicin in vitro. The combined effect of netilmicin and carbenicillin or ticarcillin is synergistic for many strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa."
833,DB00956,"Historically, hydrocodone has been used as a cough suppressant although this has largely been replaced by  in current cough and cold formulations. Hydrocodone's more potent metabolite,  has also found wide use as an analgesic and is frequently used in cases of severe pain. Its actions in the brain also produce euphoria, respiratory depression, and sedation.Hydrocodone binds to the mu opioid receptor (MOR) with the highest affinity followed by the delta opioid receptors (DOR). In the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, activation of pre-synaptic MOR on primary afferents the inhibition of calcium channel opening and increased activity of GIRK channels hyperpolarizes the neuron and prevents release of neurotransmitters. MOR can also inhibit GABAergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area, removing the inhibitory tone on dopaminergic neurons in the nucleus accumbens and contributing to the activation of the brain's reward and addiction pathway."
834,DB00957,"It can also be given with low dose ethinylestradiol for contraception as well as the treatment of moderate acne vulgaris in women â¥15 years old.Norgestimate was first described in the literature in 1977. It was developed by Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation as part of an effort to develop new hormonal contraceptives with reduced adverse effects. Norgestimate was granted FDA approval on 29 December 1989.Norgestimate is a progestin that suppresses ovulation for contraception and reduces free testosterone to treat moderate acne vulgaris. The therapeutic index is wide as overdoses are rare. These actions together result in less testosterone being available to stimulate sebaceous glands, resulting in effective treatment of some forms of acne."
835,DB00958,"Carboplatin is indicated in combination with an established combination of chemotherapeutic agents for the initial treatment of advanced ovarian carcinoma. Carboplatin is also indicated for the palliative treatment of ovarian carcinoma, recurrent after prior chemotherapy.Carboplatin is an organoplatinum antineoplastic alkylating agent used in the treatment of advanced ovarian carcinoma. Early clinical studies of carboplatin were performed in 1982. Carboplatin was developed as an analog of  with reduced nephrotoxicity and vomiting. Carboplatin was granted FDA approval on 3 March 1989.Carboplatin is an organoplatinum antineoplastic alkylating agent used in the treatment of advanced ovarian carcinoma."
836,DB00959,"Oral and intramuscular methylprednisolone are indicated for a number of endocrine,  rheumatic, collagen, dermatologic, allergic, ophthalmic, respiratory, hematologic, neoplastic, edematous, gastrointestinal, nervous system, and other disorders. Intra-articular and soft tissue injections are indicated for short term treatment of acute gouty arthritis, acute and subactute bursitis, acute nonspecific tenosynovitis, epicondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and synovitis of osteoarthritis. Intralesional injections are indicated for alopecia areata, discoid lupus erythematosus, keloids, lichen planus, lichen simplex chronicus and psoriatic plaques, necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum, and localized hypertrophic infiltrated inflammatory lesions of granuloma annulare.Methylprednisolone is a  derivative glucocorticoid with higher potency than . The efficacy of methylprednisolone in novel coronavirus pneumonia is being investigated further in clinical trials.Corticosteroids bind to the glucocorticoid receptor, inhibiting pro-inflammatory signals, and promoting anti-inflammatory signals. Lower doses of corticosteroids provide an anti-inflammatory effect, while higher doses are immunosuppressive."
837,DB00960,"In Canada, it is also indicated in the prophylaxis of angina.Pindolol is a first generation non-selective beta blocker used in the treatment of hypertension. cAMP-dependant kinase A also phosphorylates myosin light chains, increasing smooth muscle contractility. By blocking beta-1 receptors in the juxtaglomerular apparatus, pindolol inhibits the release of renin, which inhibits angiotensin II and aldosterone release. Beta-2 adrenoceptors located in the kidneys and peripheral blood vessels use a similar mechanism to activate cAMP-dependant kinase A to increase smooth muscle contractility. Blocking of the beta-2 adrenoceptor relaxes smooth muscle, leading to vasodilation."
838,DB00961,"For production of local or regional analgesia and anesthesia by local infiltration, peripheral nerve block techniques, and central neural techniques including epidural and caudal blocks.A local anesthetic that is chemically related to bupivacaine but pharmacologically related to lidocaine. Mepivicaine as a reasonably rapid onset and medium duration and is known by the proprietary names as Carbocaine and Polocaine. Mepivicaine is used in local infiltration and regional anesthesia. Systemic absorption of local anesthetics produces effects on the cardiovascular and central nervous systems. In general, the progression of anesthesia is related to the diameter, myelination, and conduction velocity of affected nerve fibers."
839,DB00962,"It is known as a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic. Zaleplon interacts with the GABA receptor complex and shares some of the pharmacological properties of the benzodiazepines. Zaleplon is a schedule IV drug in the United States.Zaleplon is a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic from the pyrazolopyrimidine class and is indicated for the short-term treatment of insomnia. While Zaleplon is a hypnotic agent with a chemical structure unrelated to benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or other drugs with known hypnotic properties, it interacts with the gamma-aminobutyric acid-benzodiazepine (GABABZ) receptor complex. Subunit modulation of the GABABZ receptor chloride channel macromolecular complex is hypothesized to be responsible for some of the pharmacological properties of benzodiazepines, which include sedative, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, and anticonvulsive effects in animal models."
840,DB00963,"For the treatment of postoperative inflammation in patients who have undergone cataract extraction.Bromfenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for ophthalmic use. Ophthalmic NSAIDs are becoming a cornerstone for the management of ocular pain and inflammation. Their well-characterized anti-inflammatory activity, analgesic property, and established safety record have also made NSAIDs an important tool for optimizing surgical outcomes. Non-ophthalmic formulations of bromfenac were withdrawn in the US in 1998 due to cases of severe liver toxicity.Bromfenac ophthalmic solution is a sterile, topical, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for ophthalmic use.The mechanism of its action is thought to be due to its ability to block prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting cyclooxygenase 1 and 2. Prostaglandins have been shown in many animal models to be mediators of certain kinds of intraocular inflammation."
841,DB00964,"For prevention or reduction of intraoperative and postoperative increases in intraocular pressure (IOP) before and after ocular laser surgery when used prophylactically. Also used as a short-term adjunctive therapy in patients with open-angle glaucoma who are on maximally tolerated medical therapy requiring additional IOP reduction.Apraclonidine, also known as iopidine, is a sympathomimetic used in glaucoma therapy. It is an alpha2-adrenergic agonist.Apraclonidine significantly lowers intraocular pressure with minimal effects on cardiovascular and pulmonary parameters. It lowers intraocular pressure by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow.Apraclonidine is a relatively selective alpha2 adrenergic receptor agonist that stimulates alpha1 receptors to a lesser extent. It has a peak ocular hypotensive effect occurring at two hours post-dosing."
842,DB00965,"For use as a radio-opaque medium for hysterosalpingography and lymphography, and as an antineoplastic agent when part of the iodine is 131-I. It is also used in follow-up imaging for chemoembolization.Ethiodized oil is used by injection as a radio-opaque contrast agent. And although these esters are primarily as ethyl monoiodostearate and ethyl diiodostearate, the actual, specific structure is unknown.There has been little detailed investigation of the metabolic fate of ethiodized oil in either man or animals. Koehler et al. employed I131-tagged ethiodol for lymphangiography in dogs and analyses of individual organs at various time intervals were done. The investigators reported an average of only 25% of the injected medium was retained in the lymphatics at the end of three days."
843,DB00966,"Generally, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) such as telmisartan bind to the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptors with high affinity, causing inhibition of the action of angiotensin II on vascular smooth muscle, ultimately leading to a reduction in arterial blood pressure. New studies suggest that telmisartan may also have PPAR&gamma; agonistic properties that could potentially confer beneficial metabolic effects, as PPAR&gamma; is a nuclear receptor that regulates specific gene transcription, and whose target genes are involved in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as anti-inflammatory responses. Telmisartan works by blocking the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone secretory effects of angiotensin II.Telmisartan interferes with the binding of angiotensin II to the angiotensin II AT1-receptor by binding reversibly and selectively to the receptors in vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. As angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor, which also stimulates the synthesis and release of aldosterone, blockage of its effects results in decreases in systemic vascular resistance. Studies also suggest that telmisartan is a partial agonist of PPAR&gamma;, which is an established target for antidiabetic drugs."
844,DB00967,"For the relief of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis, perennial (non-seasonal) allergic rhinitis. Desloratidine is also used for the sympomatic treatment of pruritus and urticaria (hives) associated with chronic idiopathic urticaria.Desloratadine is a second generation, tricyclic antihistamine that which has a selective and peripheral H1-antagonist action. Desloratidine has a long-lasting effect and does not cause drowsiness because it does not readily enter the central nervous system.Desloratadine is a long-acting second-generation H1-receptor antagonist which has a selective and peripheral H1-antagonist action. Histamine is released from histamine-storing cells (mast cells) and attaches to other cells that have receptors for histamine. nasal congestion, watery eyes) brought on by histamine."
845,DB00968,"Since then, methyldopa was largely replaced by newer, better-tolerated antihypertensive agents; Methyldopa is also available as intravenous injection, which is used to manage hypertension when oral therapy is unfeasible and to treat hypertensive crisis.Antihypertensive effects of methyldopa are mostly mediated by its pharmacologically active metabolite, alpha-methylnorepinephrine, which works as an agonist at central inhibitory alpha-adrenergic receptors. Methyldopa also reduces plasma renin activity but has negligible effects on glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow, or filtration fraction. Stimulating alpha-2 adrenergic receptors results in the inhibition of adrenergic neuronal outflow and attenuation of norepinephrine release in the brainstem. Consequently, the output of vasoconstrictor adrenergic signals to the peripheral sympathetic nervous system is reduced, leading to a reduction in blood pressure. The L-isomer of alpha-methyldopa also reduces blood pressure by inhibiting aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase, also known as DOPA decarboxylase, which is an enzyme responsible for the syntheses of dopamine and serotonin."
846,DB00969,"Alosetron was voluntarily withdrawn from the US market in November 2000 by the manufacturer due to numerous reports of severe adverse effects including ischemic colitis, severely obstructed or ruptured bowel, and death. In June 2002, the FDA approved a supplemental new drug application allowing the remarketing of the drug under restricted conditions of use.Alosetron is a potent and selective antagonist of the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor type. Activation of these receptors and the resulting neuronal depolarization affects the regulation of visceral pain, colonic transit, and GI secretions processes that are related to IBS. Activation of these channels and the resulting neuronal depolarization affect the regulation of visceral pain, colonic transit and gastrointestinal secretions, processes that relate to the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). 5-HT3 receptor antagonists such as alosetron inhibit activation of non-selective cation channels which results in the modulation of serotonin-sensitive GI motor and sensory processes."
847,DB00970,"For the treatment of Wilms' tumor, childhood rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma and metastatic, nonseminomatous testicular cancer as part of a combination chemotherapy and/or multi-modality treatment regimenA compound composed of a two cyclic peptides attached to a phenoxazine that is derived from streptomyces parvullus. It binds to DNA and inhibits RNA synthesis (transcription), with chain elongation more sensitive than initiation, termination, or release. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1993, p2015)Generally, the actinomycins exert an inhibitory effect on gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and on some fungi. This cytotoxic action is the basis for their use in the treatment of certain types of cancer. Dactinomycin is believed to produce its cytotoxic effects by binding DNA and inhibiting RNA synthesis.Good evidence exists that this drug bind strongly, but reversibly, to DNA, interfering with synthesis of RNA (prevention of RNA polymerase elongation) and, consequently, with protein synthesis."
848,DB00972,"Intranasal azelastine is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis in patients 5 years and older and for the symptomatic treatment of vasomotor rhinitis in patients 12 years and older. As a 0.15% nasal spray, azelastine hydrochloride is also indicated for over-the-counter treatment of allergies in patients aged six years and older.Azelastine, a phthalazine derivative, is an antihistamine available as an intranasal spray for the treatment of allergic and vasomotor rhinitis and as an ophthalmic solution for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. It is a racemic mixture, though there is no noted difference in pharmacologic activity between enantiomers, and was first granted FDA approval in 1996.Azelastine antagonizes the actions of histamine, resulting in the relief of histamine-mediated allergy symptoms. Onset of action occurs within 15 minutes with intranasal formulations and as quickly as 3 minutes with ophthalmic solutions. Following allergen exposure in sensitized individuals, IgE-receptor cross-linking on mast cells results in the release of histamine, which binds to H1-receptors and contributes to typical allergic symptoms such as itching, sneezing, and congestion."
849,DB00973,"In genetically NPC1L1-deficient mice, a 70% reduction in intestinal cholesterol absorption was seen, and these mice were insensitive to ezetimibe treatment - it was determined based on these findings that NPC1L1 plays an essential role in promoting intestinal cholesterol uptake via an ezetimibe-sensitive pathway. In clinical trials involving patients with homozygous and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and in those with sitosterolemia, a recommended therapeutic dose of ezetimibe was effective in reducing the LDL levels by 15-20% while increasing HDL-C by 2.5-5%. The primary target of ezetimibe is the cholesterol transport protein Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) protein. Once cholesterol in the gut lumen or bile is incorporated into the cell membrane of enterocytes, it binds to the sterol-sensing domain of NPC1L1 and forms a NPC1L1/cholesterol complex. Ezetimibe selectively blocks the NPC1L1 protein in the jejunal brush border, reducing the uptake of intestinal lumen micelles into the enterocyte."
850,DB00974,"It is used in pharmaceutical manufacturing and as a food additive.Edetate calcium is a heavy metal chelating agent. The calcium in edetate calcium can be displaced by divalent or trivalent metals to form a stable water soluble complex that can be excreted in the urine. In addition to chelating lead, edetate calcium also chelates and eliminates zinc from the body. Edetate calcium also binds cadmium, copper, iron and manganese, but to a much lesser extent than either lead or zinc. A stable chelate will form with any metal that has the ability to displace calcium from the molecule, a feature shared by lead, zinc, cadmium, manganese, iron and mercury."
851,DB00975,"For as an adjunct to coumarin anticoagulants in the prevention of postoperative thromboembolic complications of cardiac valve replacement and also used in prevention of angina.A phosphodiesterase inhibitor that blocks uptake and metabolism of adenosine by erythrocytes and vascular endothelial cells. Dipyridamole also potentiates the antiaggregating action of prostacyclin. Dipyridamole is also used in myocardial perfusion imaging, as an antiplatelet agent.Dipyridamole likely inhibits both adenosine deaminase and phosphodiesterase, preventing the degradation of cAMP, an inhibitor of platelet function. This elevation in cAMP blocks the release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids and reduces thromboxane A2 activity. Dipyridamole also directly stimulates the release of prostacyclin, which induces adenylate cyclase activity, thereby raising the intraplatelet concentration of cAMP and further inhibiting platelet aggregation."
852,DB00976,"It is used to treat mild to moderate respiratory infections.Telithromycin is a ketolide antibiotic which has an antimicrobial spectrum similar or slightly broader than that of penicillin. Telithromycin prevents bacterial growth by binding to bacterial 50S ribosomal subunits and interfering with bacterial peptide translocation and elongation.Telithromycin acts by binding to domains II and V of 23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit. By binding at domain II, telithromycin retains activity against gram-positive cocci (e.g. Streptococcus pneumoniae) in the presence of resistance mediated by methylases (erm genes) that alter the binding site at domain V. Telithromycin may also inhibit the assembly of nascent ribosomal units. This increased binding affinity may be conferred by the C11-12 carbamate side chain of telithromycin. The  side chain appears to maintain binding at domain II in the presence of resistance mediated by alterations in domain V."
853,DB00977,"Ethinylestradiol was first synthesized in 1938 by Hans Herloff Inhoffen and Walter Hohlweg at Schering. It was developed in an effort to create an estrogen with greater oral bioavailability. Ethinylestradiol soon replaced  in contraceptive pills. Ethinylestradiol was granted FDA approval on 25 June 1943.Ethinylestradiol is a synthetic estrogen that decreases luteinizing hormone to decrease endometrial vascularization, and decreases gonadotrophic hormone to prevent ovulation. It has a long duration of action as it is taken once daily, and a wide therapeutic index as overdoses are generally not associated with serious adverse effects."
854,DB00978,"For the treatment of bacterial infections of the respiratory tract (chronic bronchitis) and urinary tract, and as a pre-operative prophylactic to prevent urinary tract infection caused by: S.pneumoniae, H.influenzae, S.aureus, P.aeruginosa, E. cloacae P. mirabilis, C. civersus, S. asprphyticus, E.coli, and K.pneumoniae.Lomefloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, used to treat bacterial infections including bronchitis and urinary tract infections (UTIs). They also posses effective activity against shigella, salmonella, campylobacter, gonococcal organisms, and multi drug resistant pseudomonas and enterobacter.Lomefloxacin is a bactericidal fluoroquinolone agent with activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. The bactericidal action of lomefloxacin results from interference with the activity of the bacterial enzymes DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, which are needed for the transcription and replication of bacterial DNA. DNA gyrase appears to be the primary quinolone target for gram-negative bacteria. Topoisomerase IV appears to be the preferential target in gram-positive organisms."
855,DB00979,"Used mainly to produce mydriasis and cycloplegia for diagnostic purposes.A parasympatholytic anticholinergic used solely to obtain mydriasis or cycloplegia.Cyclopentolate is an anti-muscarinic in the same class as atropine and scopolamine. Cyclopentolate blocks the receptors in the muscles of the eye (muscarinic receptors). These receptors are involved controlling the pupil size and the shape of the lens. Cyclopentolate thus induces relaxation of the sphincter of the iris and the ciliary muscles. When applied topically to the eyes, it causes a rapid, intense cycloplegic and mydriatic effect that is maximal in 15 to 60 minutes; recovery usually occurs within 24 hours."
856,DB00980,"For the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulty with sleep onset. Ramelteon is the first in a new class of sleep agents that selectively binds to the melatonin receptors in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Ramelteon has a high affinity for the MT1 and MT2 receptors. The metabolite also has weak affinity for the 5HT2b receptor. MT1 receptors are believed to be responsible for regulation of sleepiness and facilitation of sleep onset, and MT2 receptors are believed to mediate phase-shifting effects of melatonin on the circadian rhythm."
857,DB00981,"For the treatment of glaucoma, and in the treatment of severe anticholinergic toxicity.A cholinesterase inhibitor that is rapidly absorbed through membranes. It can be applied topically to the conjunctiva. It also can cross the blood-brain barrier and is used when central nervous system effects are desired, as in the treatment of severe anticholinergic toxicity.Physostigmine is a parasympathomimetic, specifically, a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor which effectively increases the concentration of acetylcholine at the sites of cholinergic transmission. Physostigmine is used to treat glaucoma. Because it crosses the blood-brain barrier, it is also used to treat the central nervous system effects of atropine overdose and other anticholinergic drug overdoses."
858,DB00982,"Isotretinoin is indicated to treat severe recalcitrant nodular acne and patients â¥12 years enrolled in the iPLEDGE program.Isotretinoin is a retinoid derivative of vitamin A used in the treatment of severe recalcitrant acne. It was most widely marketed under the brand name Accutane, which has since been discontinued. The first isotretinoin-containing product was FDA approved on 7 May 1982.The pharmacodynamics of isotretinoin are poorly understood.Isotretinoin produces its effects through altering progress through the cell cycle, cell differentiation, survival, and apoptosis. These actions reduce sebum production, preventing the blockage of pores, and growth of acne causing bacteria. Isotretinoin induces apoptosis in sebocytes, leading to a decrease in sebum production."
859,DB00983,"Formoterol is indicated in various formulations for the treatment of asthma and COPD. It is available as a single-entity product  and in several formulations in combination with both inhaled corticosteroids  and long-acting muscarinic antagonists.Formoterol works locally in the lungs as a bronchodilator, relaxing smooth muscle and opening up the airways. It possesses both a rapid onset of action (approximately 2-3 minutes) and a long duration of action (up to 12 hours). The use of long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs), such as formoterol, without concomitant inhaled corticosteroids in asthmatic patients should be avoided, as LABA monotherapy has been associated with an increased risk of asthma-related death.Formoterol is a relatively selective long-acting agonist of beta2-adrenergic receptors, although it does carry some degree of activity at beta1 and beta3 receptors. Beta2 receptors are found predominantly in bronchial smooth muscle (with a relatively minor amount found in cardiac tissue) whereas beta1 receptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors found in the heart - for this reason, selectivity for beta2 receptors is desirable in the treatment of pulmonary diseases such as COPD and asthma."
860,DB00984,"For the treatment of refractory deficient red cell production anemias, breast carcinoma, hereditary angioedema, antithrombin III deficiency, fibrinogen excess, growth failure and Turner's syndrome. It is also indicated in the prophylaxis of hereditary angioedema.C18 steroid with androgenic and anabolic properties. It is a schedule III drug in the U.S.Nandrolone is an anabolic steroid occurring naturally in the human body, albeit in small quantities. Nandrolone increases production and urinary excretion of erythropoietin. Nandrolone binds to the androgen receptor to a greater degree than testosterone, but due to its inability to act on the muscle in ways unmediated by the receptor, has less overall effect on muscle growth.Nandrolone is an androgen receptor agonist."
861,DB00985,"Dimenhydrinate is indicated for the prevention and treatment of nausea, vomiting, or vertigo of motion sickness.Dimehydrinate was first described in the literature in 1949, and patented in 1950. Dimenhydrinate is a combination of  and  in a salt form, with 53%-55.5% dried diphenhydramine, and 44%-47% died 8-chlorotheophylline. The antiemetic properties of dimenhydrinate are primarily thought to be produced by diphenhydramine's antagonism of H1 histamine receptors in the vestibular system while the excitatory effects are thought to be produced by 8-chlorotheophylline's adenosine receptor blockade. When used in large doses, dimenhydrinate has been shown to cause a ""high"" characterized by hallucinations, excitement, incoordination, and disorientation. Dimenhydrinate was granted FDA approval on 31 May 1972.Dimenhydrinate is indicated for the prevention and treatment of nausea, vomiting, or vertigo of motion sickness."
862,DB00986,"Glycopyrronium formulated as a topical cloth is indicated to treat primary axillary hyperhidrosis in patients â¥9 years, and an inhalational solution is indicated for long term maintenance of airflow obstruction in COPD. A glycopyrronium intravenous and intramuscular injection is indicated in adults and pediatric patients to reduce the volume and acidity of gastric secretions, reduce airway secretions, and block cardiac inhibitory reflexes during the induction of anesthesia and intubation; to treat surgically-induced, drug-induced, or vagal reflex associated arrhythmias intraoperatively; and to prevent peripheral muscarinic effects of cholinergic drugs. The same injection is indicated in adults as an adjunct therapy in the treatment of peptic ulcers, as is an orally disintegrating tablet formulation. Glycopyrronium was originally granted FDA approval on 11 August 1961.Glycopyrronium is a quaternary ammonium compound that is one of the most commonly prescribed long acting muscarinic antagonists. Secretions from salivary and sweat glands, as well as gastric acid secretions, are also predominantly mediated by the M3 receptor."
863,DB00987,"(From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p472)Cytarabine is an antineoplastic anti-metabolite used in the treatment of several forms of leukemia including acute myelogenous leukemia and meningeal leukemia. Anti-metabolites masquerade as purine or pyrimidine - which become the building blocks of DNA. Cytarabine is metabolized intracellularly into its active triphosphate form (cytosine arabinoside triphosphate). Cytotoxicity is highly specific for the S phase of the cell cycle.Cytarabine acts through direct DNA damage and incorporation into DNA. Although the mechanism of action is not completely understood, it appears that cytarabine acts through the inhibition of DNA polymerase."
864,DB00988,"For the correction of hemodynamic imbalances present in the shock syndrome due to myocardial infarction, trauma, endotoxic septicemia, open-heart surgery, renal failure, and chronic cardiac decompensation as in congestive failureOne of the catecholamine neurotransmitters in the brain. It is a precursor to norepinephrine in noradrenergic nerves and is also a neurotransmitter in certain areas of the central nervous system, especially in the nigrostriatal tract, and in a few peripheral sympathetic nerves. Dopamine produces positive chronotropic and inotropic effects on the myocardium, resulting in increased heart rate and cardiac contractility. This is accomplished directly by exerting an agonist action on beta-adrenoceptors and indirectly by causing release of norepinephrine from storage sites in sympathetic nerve endings.Dopamine is a precursor to norepinephrine in noradrenergic nerves and is also a neurotransmitter in certain areas of the central nervous system. Dopamine produces positive chronotropic and inotropic effects on the myocardium, resulting in increased heart rate and cardiac contractility."
865,DB00989,"An early pathophysiological feature of Alzheimer's disease that is associated with memory loss and cognitive deficits is a deficiency of acetylcholine as a result of selective loss of cholinergic neurons in the cerebral cortex, nucleus basalis, and hippocampus. While the precise mechanism of rivastigmine's action is unknown, it is postulated to exert its therapeutic effect by enhancing cholinergic function. This is accomplished by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine through reversible inhibition of its hydrolysis by cholinesterase. If this proposed mechanism is correct, rivastigmine's effect may lessen as the disease progresses and fewer cholinergic neurons remain functionally intact.Rivastigmine is a carbamate derivative that is structurally related to physostigmine, but not to donepezil and tacrine. The anticholinesterase activity of rivastigmine is relatively specific for brain acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase compared with those in peripheral tissues."
866,DB00990,"It irreversibly binds to the active site of the enzyme resulting in permanent inhibition.Aromatase is an enzyme that converts hormones to estrogen in the body's adrenal glands. The selective AIs (SAIs) selectively reduce levels of estrogen without interfering with levels of other steroid hormones that are produced by the adrenal gland. Drugs in this class include anastrozole (Arimidex &trade;), letrozole (Femara &trade;) and exemestane (Aromasin &trade;).Breast cancer cell growth may be estrogen-dependent. Aromatase (exemestane) is the principal enzyme that converts androgens to estrogens both in pre- and postmenopausal women. Estrogen deprivation through aromatase inhibition is an effective and selective treatment for some postmenopausal patients with hormone-dependent breast cancer."
867,DB00991,"Used to relieve the inflammation, swelling, stiffness, and joint pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.Oxaprozin is a non-narcotic, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), used to relieve the inflammation, swelling, stiffness, and joint pain associated with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.Oxaprozin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with analgesic and antipyretic properties. Oxaprozin is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, dysmenorrhea, and to alleviate moderate pain.Anti-inflammatory effects of Oxaprozin are believed to be due to inhibition of cylooxygenase in platelets which leads to the blockage of prostaglandin synthesis. Antipyretic effects may be due to action on the hypothalamus, resulting in an increased peripheral blood flow, vasodilation, and subsequent heat dissipation. Oxaprozin is a non-selective NSAID, with a cell assay system showing lower COX-2 selectivity implying higher COX-1 selectivity."
868,DB00992,"For topical use, in combination with 570 to 670 nm wavelength red light illumination, in the treatment of non-hyperkeratotic actinic keratoses of the face and scalp in immunocompetent patients when used in conjunction with lesion preparation (debridement using a sharp dermal curette).Methyl aminolevulinate is a prodrug that is metabolised to Protoporphyrin IX (a photosensitizer) used in photodynamic therapy.After topical application of methyl aminolevulinate, porphyrins will accumulate intracellularly in the treated skin lesions. The intracellular porphyrins (including PpIX) are photoactive, fluorescing compounds and, upon light activation in the presence of oxygen, singlet oxygen is formed which causes damage to cellular compartments, in particular the mitochondria. Light activation of accumulated porphyrins leads to a photochemical reaction and thereby phototoxicity to the light-exposed target cells.Photosensitization following application of methyl aminolevulinate cream occurs through the metabolic conversion of methyl aminolevulinate (prodrug) to photoactive porphyrins (PAP), which accumulates in the skin lesions to which the cream has been applied. When exposed to light of appropriate wavelength and energy, the accumulated photoactive porphyrins produce a photodynamic reaction, resulting in a cytotoxic process dependent upon the simultaneous presence of oxygen. The absorption of light results in an excited state of porphyrin molecules, and subsequent spin transfer from photoactive porphyrins to molecular oxygen generates singlet oxygen, which can further react to form superoxide and hydroxyl radicals."
869,DB00993,"Azathioprine is indicated to treat rheumatoid arthritis and prevent renal transplant rejection.Azathioprine is a prodrug of 6-mercaptopurine, first synthesized in 1956 by Gertrude Elion, William Lange, and George Hitchings in an attempt to produce a derivative of 6-mercaptopurine with a better therapeutic index. Azathiprine was granted FDA approval on 20 March 1968.Azathioprine is an immunosuppressive agent which functions through modulation of rac1 to induce T cell apoptosis, as well as other unknown immunosuppressive functions. Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of malignancies of the skin and lymphomas.Azathioprine's mechanism of action is not entirely understood but it may be related to inhibition of purine synthesis, along with inhibition of B and T cells. 6-thioguanine triphosphate, a metabolite of azathioprine, modulates activation of rac1 when costimulated with CD28, inducing T cell apoptosis. This may be mediated through rac1's action on mitogen-activated protein kinase, NF-kappaB."
870,DB00994,"It is strongly recommended that oral neomycin is only used in infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria to reduce the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. The ophthalmic solution containing neomycin in combination with polymyxin B sulfates and dexamethasone is used to treat steroid-responsive inflammatory ocular conditions for which a corticosteroid is indicated and where bacterial infection or a risk of bacterial infection exists.Neomycin is a broad-spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotic drug that is derived from the metabolic products of _Streptomyces fradiae_. Neomycin is active against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms and mediates its pharmacological action by binding to bacterial ribosomes and inhibiting protein synthesis, which is crucial for the survival of bacteria. Neomycin sulfate as monotherapy is available in an oral solution for adjunct use in the treatment of hepatic coma. Neomycin has no antifungal activity and has some activity against some protozoa.Like other aminoglycoside antibiotic drugs, neomycin inhibits bacterial ribosomes by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit of susceptible bacteria and disrupting the translational machinery of bacterial protein synthesis."
871,DB00995,"Used in the treatment of active, progressive or destructive forms of inflammatory arthritis, such as adult rheumatoid arthritis.Auranofin is a gold salt that is capable of eliciting pharmacologic actions that suppress inflammation and stimulate cell-mediated immunity. It has subsequently been listed by the World Health Organization as a member of the antirheumatic agent category. Heme oxygenase 1 is an inducible heme-degrading enzyme with anti-inflammatory properties.Auranofin is a gold salt used in treating inflammatory arthritis. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, gold salts such as auranofin can be administered to decrease joint inflammation and prevent the destruction of bones and cartilage. Another study showed that auranofin enhanced the production of free radicals, governing T-cell activation."
872,DB00996,"In the United States, gabapentin is officially indicated for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia in adults and for the adjunctive treatment of partial-onset seizures, with or without secondary generalization, in patients 3 years of age and older. It is also used in adults for the treatment of various types of peripheral neuropathic pain, such as painful diabetic neuropathy.Gabapentin is a structural analogue of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid () that was first approved for use in the United States in 1993. It has a wide therapeutic index, with doses in excess of 8000 mg/kg failing to cause a fatal reaction in rats. Gabapentin appears to inhibit the action of Î±2Î´-1 subunits, thus decreasing the density of pre-synaptic voltage-gated calcium channels and subsequent release of excitatory neurotransmitters. There is some evidence that gabapentin also acts on adenosine receptors and voltage-gated potassium channels, though the clinical relevance of its action at these sites is unclear."
873,DB00997,"For the liposomal formulation, doxorubicin is indicated for the treatment of ovarian cancer that has progressed or recurred after platinum-based chemotherapy, AIDS-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma after the failure of prior systemic chemotherapy or intolerance to such therapy, and multiple myeloma in combination with bortezomib in patients who have not previously received bortezomib and have received at least one prior therapy.Doxorubicin is a cytotoxic anthracycline antibiotic isolated from cultures of Streptomyces peucetius var. Although its detailed molecular mechanisms have yet to be understood, doxorubicin is generally thought to exert its effect through DNA intercalation, which eventually leads to DNA damage and the generation of reactive oxygen species. It is generally thought to exert its antitumor effect by destabilizing DNA structures through intercalation, thus introducing DNA strand breakages and damages. Additionally, the doxorubicin-DNA complex can interfere with topoisomerase II enzyme activity by preventing relegation of topoisomerase-mediated DNA breaks, thus inhibiting replication and transcription and inducing apoptosis. Moreover, doxorubicin can be metabolized by microsomal NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase into a semiquinone radical, which can be reoxidized in the presence of oxygen to form oxygen radicals."
874,DB00998,"Frovatriptan is a triptan drug developed by Vernalis for the treatment of migraine headaches, in particular those associated with menstruation. Frovatriptan causes vasoconstriction of arteries and veins that supply blood to the head. It is structurally distinct from, but pharmacologically related to other selective 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonists. Frovatriptan has no significant effects on GABAA mediated channel activity and has no significant affinity for benzodiazepine binding sites. Frovatriptan eases the pain associated with migraine by narrowing these blood vessels."
875,DB00999,"Hydrochlorothiazide is indicated alone or in combination for the management of edema associated with congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, acute glomerulonephritis, chronic renal failure, and corticosteroid and estrogen therapy. It is indicated to treat edema and hypertension. Hydrochlorothiazide use is common but declining in favour of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Hydrochlorothiazide was granted FDA approval on 12 February 1959.Hydrochlorothiazide prevents the reabsorption of sodium and water from the distal convoluted tubule, allowing for the increased elimination of water in the urine. Normally, sodium is reabsorbed into epithelial cells of the distal convoluted tubule and pumped into the basolateral interstitium by a sodium-potassium ATPase, creating a concentration gradient between the epithelial cell and the distal convoluted tubule that promotes the reabsorption of water."
876,DB01000,"For the treatment of bacterial infections caused by susceptible organisms.A cyclohexylamido analog of penicillanic acid.Cyclacillin, a penicillin, is a cyclohexylamido analog of penicillanic acid. Cyclacillin is more resistant to beta-lactamase hydrolysis than ampicillin, is much better absorbed when given by mouth and, as a result, the levels reached in the blood and in the urine are considerably higher than those obtained with the same dose of ampicillin. Cyclacillin has been replaced by newer penicillin treatments.The bactericidal activity of cyclacillin results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Cyclacillin is stable in the presence of a variety of b-lactamases, including penicillinases and some cephalosporinases."
877,DB01001,"It is 29 times more selective for beta2 receptors than beta1 receptors giving it higher specificity for pulmonary beta receptors versus beta1-adrenergic receptors located in the heart. It is also used prophylactically for exercise-induced asthma.Salbutamol (INN) or albuterol (USAN), a moderately selective beta(2)-receptor agonist similar in structure to terbutaline, is widely used as a bronchodilator to manage asthma and other chronic obstructive airway diseases. Metabolic effects such as hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia also may occur, although it is not known whether these effects are mediated by beta-1 or beta-2 receptors. Increased cyclic AMP concentrations are also associated with the inhibition of release of mediators from mast cells in the airway. Salbutamol has been shown in most controlled clinical trials to have more effect on the respiratory tract, in the form of bronchial smooth muscle relaxation, than isoproterenol at comparable doses while producing fewer cardiovascular effects."
878,DB01002,"It is the S-enantiomer of bupivacaine. Levobupivacaine hydrochloride is commonly marketed by AstraZeneca under the trade name Chirocaine. In particular, the specific levobupivacaine enantiomer is a worthwhile pursuit because it demonstrates less vasodilation and possesses a greater length of action in comparison to bupivacaine. When administered appropriately, the occurrence of adverse effects is not anticipated much if at all. Regardless, allergic reactions may also occur - although only rarely.Levobupivacaine, a local anesthetic agent, is indicated for the production of local or regional anesthesia or analgesia for surgery, for oral surgery procedures, for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, and for obstetrical procedures.Local anesthetics such as Levobupivacaine block the generation and the conduction of nerve impulses, presumably by increasing the threshold for electrical excitation in the nerve, by slowing the propagation of the nerve impulse, and by reducing the rate of rise of the action potential."
879,DB01003,"For the management of patients with bronchial asthma. Also used in the treatment of vernal keratoconjunctivitis, vernal conjunctivitis, and vernal keratitis.A chromone complex that acts by inhibiting the release of chemical mediators from sensitized mast cells. It is used in the prophylactic treatment of both allergic and exercise-induced asthma, but does not affect an established asthmatic attack.Cromoglicate or cromolyn (USAN), a synthetic compound, inhibits antigen-induced bronchospasms and, hence, is used to treat asthma and allergic rhinitis. Cromoglicate is used as an ophthalmic solution to treat conjunctivitis and is taken orally to treat systemic mastocytosis and ulcerative colitis.Cromoglicate inhibits degranulation of mast cells, subsequently preventing the release of histamine and slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A), mediators of type I allergic reactions. Cromoglicate also may reduce the release of inflammatory leukotrienes."
880,DB01004,"Also used in the treatment of severe cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease, including CMV pneumonia, CMV gastrointestinal disease, and disseminated CMV infections, in immunocompromised patients.An acyclovir analog that is a potent inhibitor of the Herpesvirus family including cytomegalovirus. Sensitive human viruses include cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus -1 and -2 (HSV-1, HSV-2), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV), however clinical studies have been limited to assessment of efficacy in patients with CMV infection. It inhibits virus replication by its encorporation into viral DNA. TK catalyzes phosphorylation of ganciclovir to the monophosphate, which is then subsequently converted into the diphosphate by cellular guanylate kinase and into the triphosphate by a number of cellular enzymes. When used as a substrate for viral DNA polymerase, ganciclovir triphosphate competitively inhibits dATP leading to the formation of 'faulty' DNA."
881,DB01005,"Hydroxyurea is indicated to reduce the frequency of painful crises and to reduce the need for blood transfusions in adult and pediatric patients, 2 years of age and older, with sickle cell anemia with recurrent moderate to severe painful crises.Hydroxyurea is a non-alkylating antineoplastic agent that was first synthesized in 1869 but was not characterized biologically until 1928. It was first approved by the FDA in 1998 for the treatment of sickle cell anemia in adults. Although clinical evidence on the efficacy of hydroxyurea in certain conditions exists, hydroxyurea is used sparingly in clinical settings, largely due to lack of knowledge and adherence, the need for therapeutic monitoring, and serious side effects of secondary cancer and birth defects.The correlation between hydroxyurea concentrations, reduction of crisis rate, and increase in HbF, is not known.The precise mechanism by which hydroxyurea produces its antineoplastic effects cannot, at present, be described. In vitro studies utilizing Chinese hamster cells suggest that hydroxyurea is lethal to normally radioresistant S-stage cells and holds other cells of the cell cycle in the G1 or pre-DNA synthesis stage where they are most susceptible to the effects of irradiation. The third mechanism of action has been theorized on the basis of in vitro studies of HeLa cells: it appears that hydroxyurea, by inhibition of DNA synthesis, hinders the normal repair process of cells damaged but not killed by irradiation, thereby decreasing their survival rate; there is no alteration of RNA and protein syntheses."
882,DB01006,"Letrozole is indicated to treat postmenopausal women with hormone receptor (HR) positive early breast cancer, postmenopausal women with early breast cancer who have periviously been treated with tamoxifen, and postmenopausal women with HR+ or unknown advanced breast cancer.Letrozole, or CGS 20267, is an oral non-steroidal type II aromatase inhibitor first described in the literature in 1990. It is a third generation aromatase inhibitor like  and , meaning it does not significantly affect cortisol, aldosterone, and thyroxine. As breast tissue is stimulated by estrogens, decreasing their production is a way of suppressing recurrence of the breast tumor tissue. Letrozole is a third generation type II aromatase inhibitor used to treat estrogen dependant breast cancers. This competitive inhibition prevents the conversion of androgens to estrogen."
883,DB01007,"For the local treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (moniliasis). Tioconazole is an imidazole antifungal used to treat fungal and yeast infections. Topical formulations are used for ringworm, jock itch, athleteâs foot, and tinea versicolor or âsun fungusâ. Tioconazole interacts with 14-alpha demethylase, a cytochrome P-450 enzyme that converts lanosterol to ergosterol, an essential component of the yeast membrane. In this way, tioconazole inhibits ergosterol synthesis, resulting in increased cellular permeability."
884,DB01008,"It is also used as a component of pretransplant conditioning regimens in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation for acute myeloid leukemia and nonmalignant diseases.Busulfan is a bifunctional alkylating agent, having a selective immunosuppressive effect on bone marrow. It is not a structural analog of the nitrogen mustards. Alkylating agents are so named because of their ability to add alkyl groups to many electronegative groups under conditions present in cells. Busulfan is an alkylating agent that contains 2 labile methanesulfonate groups attached to opposite ends of a 4-carbon alkyl chain. These carbonium ions alkylate DNA, which results in the interference of DNA replication and RNA transcription, ultimately leading to the disruption of nucleic acid function."
885,DB01009,"Ketoprofen has pharmacologic actions similar to those of other prototypical NSAIDs, which inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. Ketoprofen is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, dysmenorrhea, and alleviate moderate pain.The anti-inflammatory effects of ketoprofen are believed to be due to inhibition cylooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an enzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis via the arachidonic acid pathway. This results in decreased levels of prostaglandins that mediate pain, fever and inflammation. Ketoprofen is a non-specific cyclooxygenase inhibitor and inhibition of COX-1 is thought to confer some of its side effects, such as GI upset and ulceration. Ketoprofen is thought to have anti-bradykinin activity, as well as lysosomal membrane-stabilizing action."
886,DB01010,"For the differential diagnosis of myasthenia gravis and as an adjunct in the evaluation of treatment requirements in this disease. Its effect is manifest within 30 to 60 seconds after injection and lasts an average of 10 minutes. Edrophonium's pharmacologic action is due primarily to the inhibition or inactivation of acetylcholinesterase at sites of cholinergic transmission. Stimulation of these receptors causes to muscle contraction. In myasthenia gravis the body's immune system destroys many of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, so that the muscle becomes less responsive to nervous stimulation."
887,DB01011,"It is used as a test of the feedback hypothalamic-pituitary mechanism in the diagnosis of cushing syndrome.Metopirone is an inhibitor of endogenous adrenal corticosteroid synthesis.The pharmacological effect of Metopirone is to reduce cortisol and corticosterone production by inhibiting the 11-&szlig;-hydroxylation reaction in the adrenal cortex. Removal of the strong inhibitory feedback mechanism exerted by cortisol results in an increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) production by the pituitary. With continued blockade of the enzymatic steps leading to production of cortisol and corticosterone, there is a marked increase in adrenocortical secretion of their immediate precursors, 11-desoxycortisol and desoxycorticosterone, which are weak suppressors of ACTH release, and a corresponding elevation of these steroids in the plasma and of their metabolites in the urine. Because of these actions, metopirone is used as a diagnostic test, with urinary 17-OHCS measured as an index of pituitary ACTH responsiveness. Metopirone may also suppress biosynthesis of aldosterone, resulting in a mild natriuresis."
888,DB01012,"For the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease who are on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Also for the treatment of hypercalcemia in patients with parathyroid carcinoma.Cinacalcet is a calcimimetic sold by Amgen under the trade name SensiparÂ® in North America and Australia and as MimparaÂ® in Europe. Secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive disease, associated with increases in parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels and derangements in calcium and phosphorus metabolism. The goals of treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism are to lower levels of PTH, calcium, and phosphorus in the blood, in order to prevent progressive bone disease and the systemic consequences of disordered mineral metabolism. In CKD patients on dialysis with uncontrolled secondary HPT, reductions in PTH are associated with a favorable impact on bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP), bone turnover and bone fibrosis."
889,DB01013,"Clobetasol propionate is indicated to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis as well as inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid responsive dermatoses.Clobetasol propionate is a prednisolone derivative with higher specificity for glucocorticoid receptors than mineralocorticoid receptors. It has demonstrated superior activity compared to  and was first described in the literature in 1974. Clobetasol Propionate was granted FDA approval on 27 December 1985.Corticosteroids bind to the glucocorticoid receptor, inhibiting pro-inflammatory signals, and promoting anti-inflammatory signals. Clobetasol propionate is generally applied twice daily so the duration of action is long. Lower doses of corticosteroids provide an anti-inflammatory effect, while higher doses are immunosuppressive."
890,DB01014,"It is sold under the name ""Colazal"" in the US and ""Colazide"" in the UK. The chemical name is (E)-5- phenyl]azo] -2-hydroxybenzoic acid. It is usually administered as the disodium salt. Mesalazine is also known as 5-aminosalicylic acid, or 5-ASA.Balsalazide is a prodrug that has little or no pharmacologic activity until it is enzymatically cleaved in the colon to produce mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid), an anti inflammatory drug indicated for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways (catalyzes the formation of prostaglandin precursors from arachidonic acid), and through the lipoxygenase pathways (catalyzes the formation of leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids from arachidonic acid and its metabolites), is increased in patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease."
891,DB01015,"In Canada, additional indications include the adjunctive treatment of cholera, treatment of bacillary dysentery, nocardiosis, and second-line treatment of brucellosis in combination with  or .Sulfamethoxazole is a bacteriostatic sulfonamide antibiotic that interferes with folic acid synthesis in susceptible bacteria. In this combination, sulfamethoxazole is useful for the treatment of a variety of bacterial infections, including those of the urinary, respiratory, and gastrointestinal tracts.Sulfamethoxazole is a bacteriostatic sulfonamide antibiotic that inhibits a critical step in bacterial folate synthesis. Studies have shown that bacterial resistance develops more slowly with the combination of the two drugs than with either trimethoprim or sulfamethoxazole alone, as together they inhibit sequential steps in the bacterial folate synthesis pathway. Sulfamethoxazole treatment may contribute to folate deficiency and should therefore be used with caution in patients at a higher risk of developing a deficiency. Hemolysis has been observed in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency who are using sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim.Sulfamethoxazole is a sulfonamide that inhibits bacterial dihydrofolic acid synthesis due to its structural similarity to an endogenous substrate, para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)."
892,DB01016,"Glyburide stimulates insulin secretion through the closure of ATP-sensitive potassium channels on beta cells, raising intracellular potassium and calcium ion concentrations. A formulation with metformin was granted FDA approval on on 31 July 2000.Glyburide is a second generation sulfonylurea that stimulates insulin secretion through the closure of ATP-sensitive potassium channels on beta cells, raising intracellular potassium and calcium ion concentrations. Glibenclamide has a long duration of action as it is given once daily, and a wide therapeutic index as patients are started at doses as low as 0.75mg but that can increase as high as 10mg or more. The ATP-sensitive potassium channels on beta cells are known as sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1). Normally SUR1 closes in response to high glucose concentrations, the membrane potential of the cells becomes less negative, the cell depolarizes, voltage gated calcium channels open, calcium ions enter the cell, and the increased intracellular calcium concentration stimulates the release of insulin containing granules."
893,DB01017,"Oral and intravenous formulations are indicated to treat infections of susceptible microorganisms. These include rickettsiae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Chlamydophila psittaci, Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Borrelia recurrentis, Haemophilus ducreyi, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, Vibrio cholerae, Campylobacter fetus, Brucella species, Bartonella bacilliformis, Klebsiella granulomatis, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Shigella species, Acinetobacter species, Haemophilus influenzae, and Kelbsiella species.Minocycline was first described in the literacture in 1966. It is a second generation tetracycline antibiotic that is active against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. Like other semisynthetic tetracyclines, minocycline has modifications to carbons 7-9 on the D ring to generate higher efficacy than previous tetracyclines. Minocycline was granted FDA approval on 30 June 1971.Minocycline is a tetracycline antibiotic that binds to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit and interferes with protein synthesis."
894,DB01018,"Guanfacine is indicated alone or as an adjunct with stimulants to treat ADHD.Guanfacine, or BS 100-141, is a selective alpha-A2 adrenergic receptor agonist initially indicated for the treatment of hypertension but is now indicated as an extended release tablet for the treatment of ADHD. Guanfacine was granted FDA approval on 27 October 1986.Guanfacine is a selective alpha-2A adrenergic receptor agonist but it is unclear how this translates to the treatment of ADHD. It has a long duration of action as it is given once daily and a wide therapeutic window as fatal overdoses have not been described in literature. Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope.Guanfacine is a selective alpha-2A adrenergic receptor agonist, which reduces the effects of the sympathetic nervous system on the heart and circulatory system. The link between guanfacineâs molecular mechanism and itâs effect on the treatment of ADHD has not been determined."
895,DB01019,"Bethanechol is indicated for the treatment of acute, functional postpartum and postoperative urinary retention. As a cholinergic agent, bethanechol is similar in structure and pharmacological function to acetylcholine and is used in specific cases when stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system is necessary. An advantage of bethanechol is that in contrast to acetylcholine, bethanechol is not degraded by cholinesterase allowing its effects to be longer-lasting.Bethanechol is selective for muscarinic receptors and has little to no impact on nicotinic receptors. Bethanechol is a direct muscarinic agonist and stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system by binding to postganglionic muscarinic receptors. Though there are 5 types of muscarinic receptors (M1, M2, M3, M4, M5), binding of bethanechol to M3 is most clinically significant since M3 receptors are present in intestinal smooth muscle and the bladder."
896,DB01020,"Like other organic nitrates, isosorbide mononitrate acts as a prodrug for its active metabolite, , which mediates the therapeutic action of isosorbide mononitrate. The extended-release forms of the drug are also available generically and under the brand name Imdur.Isosorbide mononitrate is an anti-anginal agent and vasodilator that relaxes vascular smooth muscle to prevent and manage angina pectoris. Nitric oxide works on both arteries and veins, but predominantly veins: by relaxing veins and reducing the central venous pressure, nitric oxide causes venous pooling and a decrease in the venous return to the heart, thus decreasing cardiac preload. Reduced cardiac preload and afterload caused by nitric oxide causes a reduction in myocardial oxygen consumption; decreased myocardial oxygen demand, along with increased coronary blood flow, leads to an increased in the oxygen content of coronary sinus blood  and the relief from ischemia. The duration of anti-anginal action of at least 12 hours was observed with an asymmetrical dosing regimen.Isosorbide mononitrate acts as a prodrug for nitric oxide (NO), which is a potent vasodilator gas that is released when the drug is metabolized."
897,DB01021,"Used in the treatment of oedema (including that associated with heart failure) and hypertension.A thiazide diuretic with properties similar to those of hydrochlorothiazide. Thiazides also cause loss of potassium and an increase in serum uric acid. As a diuretic, Trichloromethiazide inhibits active chloride reabsorption at the early distal tubule via the Na-Cl cotransporter, resulting in an increase in the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water. Thiazides like Trichloromethiazide also inhibit sodium ion transport across the renal tubular epithelium through binding to the thiazide sensitive sodium-chloride transporter. The antihypertensive mechanism of Trichloromethiazide is less well understood although it may be mediated through its action on carbonic anhydrases in the smooth muscle or through its action on the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (KCa) channel, also found in the smooth muscle."
898,DB01022,"Parenteral (intravenous, intramuscular, and subcutaneous) phylloquinone is indicated to treat coagulation disorders due to faulty formation of coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X caused by vitamin K deficiency or some interference with vitamin K activity. These indications include the above indications as well as hypoprothrombinemia secondary to sprue, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, intestinal resection, pancreatic cystic fibrosis, or regional enteritis; or hypoprothrombinemia caused by interference with vitamin k metabolism.Vitamin K1, also called phylloquinone or phytonadione, is a fat soluble vitamin. Phylloquinone is a cofactor of the enzyme Î³-carboxylase, which modifies and activates precursors to coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X. Patients should have their prothrombin time monitored during therapy and healthcare professionals should be aware of the increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions with parenteral administration.Vitamin K is a cofactor of gamma-carboxylase. Binding of calcium ions converts these clotting factors to their active form, which are then secreted from hepatocytes into the blood, restoring normal clotting function."
899,DB01023,"It acts primarily on vascular smooth muscle cells by stabilizing voltage-gated L-type calcium channels in their inactive conformation. In addition to binding to L-type calcium channels, felodipine binds to a number of calcium-binding proteins, exhibits competitive antagonism of the mineralcorticoid receptor, inhibits the activity of calmodulin-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, and blocks calcium influx through voltage-gated T-type calcium channels. Felodipine is used to treat mild to moderate essential hypertension.Felodipine belongs to the dihydropyridine (DHP) class of calcium channel blockers (CCBs), the most widely used class of CCBs. Felodipine also binds to calmodulin and inhibits calmodulin-dependent calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Felodipine is able to bind to skeletal and cardiac muscle isoforms of troponin C, one of the key regulatory proteins in muscle contraction."
900,DB01024,"It was derived from _Penicillium stoloniferum_, and has also shown antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral properties.. Mycophenolic acid is used in immunosuppressive regimens as part of a triple therapy that includes a calcineurin inhibitor (ciclosporin or tacrolimus) and prednisolone. , a prodrug of mycophenolic acid, is also prescribed to transplant recipients to prevent organ rejection.Mycophenolic acid is a potent inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) that blocks _de novo_ biosynthesis of purine nucleotides. This affects lymphocytes primarily and leads to the suppression of DNA synthesis in T- and B-cells. Patients treated with mycophenolic acid have a higher risk of developing new or reactivated viral infections, serious infections, blood dyscrasias (including pure red cell aplasia), serious gastrointestinal tract complications, acute inflammatory syndrome associated with mycophenolate products, lymphoma, and other malignancies. While other cell types are able to use salvage pathways, T- and B-lymphocyte proliferation is a mechanism heavily dependent on the _de novo_ synthesis of purines."
901,DB01026,"In Europe, it is also used in the treatment of endogenous Cushing's syndrome.Ketoconazole is an imidazole antifungal agent used in the prevention and treatment of a variety of fungal infections. It functions by preventing the synthesis of ergosterol, the fungal equivalent of cholesterol, thereby increasing membrane fluidity and preventing growth of the fungus. Ketoconazole was first approved in an oral formulation for systemic use by the FDA in 1981. At this time it was considered a significant improvement over previous antifungals,  and , due to its broad spectrum and good absorption. This results in inhibition of ergosterol synthesis and increased fungal cellular permeability due to reduced amounts of ergosterol present in the fungal cell membrane."
902,DB01028,"If so employed, it should be administered with nitrous oxide to achieve a relatively light level of anesthesia, and a neuromuscular blocking agent given concurrently to obtain the desired degree of muscular relaxation. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1994, p180)    In the US, methoxyflurane is one of the products that have been withdrawn or removed from the market for reasons of safety or effectiveness.Methoxyflurane is a general inhalation anesthetic used for induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. It induces muscle relaxation and reduces pains sensitivity by altering tissue excitability. It does so by decreasing the extent of gap junction mediated cell-cell coupling and altering the activity of the channels that underlie the action potential.Methoxyflurane induces a reduction in junctional conductance by decreasing gap junction channel opening times and increasing gap junction channel closing times. Methoxyflurane also activates calcium dependent ATPase in the sarcoplasmic reticulum by increasing the fluidity of the lipid membrane."
903,DB01029,"A combination product with hydrochlorothiazide is indicated for hypertension in patients with uncontrolled hypertension with monotherapy or first line in patients not expected to be well controlled with monotherapy.Irbesartan is an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) indicated to treat hypertension or diabetic nephropathy. Unlike angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, ARBs are not associated with a dry cough. It has a long duration of action as it is usually taken once daily and a wide therapeutic index as doses may be as low as 150mg daily but doses of 900mg/day were well tolerated in healthy human subjects.Irbesartan prevents angiotensin II binding to the AT1 receptor in tissues like vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Irbesartanâs prevention of angiotensin II binding causes vascular smooth muscle relaxation and prevents the secretion of aldosterone, lowering blood pressure. Angiotensin II would otherwise bind to the AT1 receptor, inducing vasoconstriction and aldosterone secretion, raising blood pressure."
904,DB01030,"Also used as a second-line therapy for treatment-sensitive small cell lung cancer, as well as in combination with cisplatin for the treatment of stage IV-B, recurrent, or persistent cervical cancer not amenable to curative treatment with surgery and/or radiation therapy.An antineoplastic agent used to treat ovarian cancer. During these processes, DNA topoisomerase I creates reversible single-stranded breaks in double-stranded DNA, allowing intact single DNA strands to pass through the break and relieve the topologic constraints inherent in supercoiled DNA. Topotecan interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Unlike irinotecan, topotecan is found predominantly in the inactive carboxylate form at neutral pH and it is not a prodrug.Topotecan has the same mechanism of action as irinotecan and is believed to exert its cytotoxic effects during the S-phase of DNA synthesis. Topotecan binds to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevents religation of these single strand breaks."
905,DB01032,"It inhibits the renal excretion of organic anions and reduces tubular reabsorption of urate. Probenecid has also been used to treat patients with renal impairment, and, because it reduces the renal tubular excretion of other drugs, has been used as an adjunct to antibacterial therapy.Probenecid is a uricosuric and renal tubular blocking agent and is used in combination with colchicine to treat chronic gouty arthritis when complicated by frequent, recurrent acute attacks of gout. It inhibits the reabsorption of urate at the proximal convoluted tubule, thus increasing the urinary excretion of uric acid and decreasing serum urate levels. This results in an increase in the plasma concentrations of acidic drugs eliminated principally by renal secretion, but only a slight increase if the drug is eliminated mainly by filtration. The mechanism by which probenecid inhibits renal tubular transport is not known, but the drug may inhibit transport enzymes that require a source of high energy phosphate bonds and/or nonspecifically interfere with substrate access to protein receptor sites on the kidney tubules."
906,DB01033,"It interferes with nucleic acid synthesis by inhibiting purine metabolism and is used, usually in combination with other drugs, in the treatment of or in remission maintenance programs for leukemia.Mercaptopurine is one of a large series of purine analogues which interfere with nucleic acid biosynthesis and has been found active against human leukemias. It is an analogue of the purine bases adenine and hypoxanthine. It is not known exactly which of any one or more of the biochemical effects of mercaptopurine and its metabolites are directly or predominantly responsible for cell death.Mercaptopurine competes with hypoxanthine and guanine for the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRTase) and is itself converted to thioinosinic acid (TIMP). Upon methylation, TIMP forms 6-methylthioinosinate (MTIMP) which inhibits glutamine-5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase in addition to TIMP. In comparison, some mercaptopurine may be converted to nucleotide derivatives of 6-thioguanine (6-TG) via actions of inosinate (IMP) dehydrogenase and xanthylate (XMP) aminase that convert TIMP to thioguanylic acid (TGMP)."
907,DB01035,"For the treatment of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.A derivative of procaine with less CNS action.Procainamide is an agent indicated for production of local or regional anesthesia and in the treatment of ventricular tachycardia occurring during cardiac manipulation, such as surgery or catheterization, or which may occur during acute myocardial infarction, digitalis toxicity, or other cardiac diseases. The mode of action of the antiarrhythmic effect of Procainamide appears to be similar to that of procaine and quinidine. Ventricular excitability is depressed and the stimulation threshold of the ventricle is increased during diastole. The sinoatrial node is, however, unaffected.Procainamide is sodium channel blocker. It stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses thereby effecting local anesthetic action."
908,DB01036,"For the treatment of overactive bladder (with symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, or urge incontinence).Tolterodine is an antimuscarinic drug that is used to treat urinary incontinence. Both urinary bladder contraction and salivation are mediated via cholinergic muscarinic receptors. After oral administration, tolterodine is metabolized in the liver, resulting in the formation of the 5-hydroxymethyl derivative, a major pharmacologically active metabolite. Tolterodine has a pronounced effect on bladder function. The main effects of tolterodine are an increase in residual urine, reflecting an incomplete emptying of the bladder, and a decrease in detrusor pressure, consistent with an antimuscarinic action on the lower urinary tract.Both tolterodine and its active metabolite, 5-hydroxymethyltolterodine, act as competitive antagonists at muscarinic receptors."
909,DB01037,"It is used in newly diagnosed patients with Parkinson's disease. It also may be given with levodopa upon onset of disability. It is the premature degradation of dopamine that results in the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Selegiline can prolong the effects of dopamine in the brain by preventing its breakdown through seletively blocking MAO-B. At higher doses, selegiline can also inhibit monozmine oxidase type A (MAO-A), allowing it to be used for the treatment of depression."
910,DB01039,"Fenofibrate is also indicated to treat adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia.Fenofibrate is a fibric acid derivative like  and . Fenofibrate was granted FDA approval on 31 December 1993.Fenofibrate is a fibrate that activates peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARÎ±) to alter lipid metabolism and treat primary hypercholesterolemia, mixed dyslipidemia, and severe hypertriglyceridemia. Fenofibrate requires once daily dosing and has a half life of 19-27 hours so its duration of action is long. Fenofibrate capsules are given at a dose of 50-150mg daily so the therapeutic index is wide. This mechanism of increased lipid metabolism is also associated with increased oxidative stress on the liver."
911,DB01041,"Thalidomide is primarily used for the acute treatment and maintenance therapy to prevent and suppress the cutaneous manifestations of moderate to severe erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). A piperidinyl isoindole originally introduced as a non-barbiturate hypnotic, thalidomide was withdrawn from the market due to teratogenic effects. It has been reintroduced and used for a number of inflammatory disorders and cancers. Thalidomide can inhibit the expression myeloid differentiating factor 88 (MyD88), an adaptor protein that is involved in the TNF-alpha production signalling pathway, at the protein and RNA level. Finally, some evidences suggest that thalidomide can block alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AGP), a known inducer of the NF-kB/MyD88 pathway, thus inhibiting the expression of TNF-alpha ."
912,DB01042,"Melphalan is indicated for use as a high-dose conditioning treatment prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with multiple myeloma. Melphalan is a component of HEPZATO KIT, a liver-directed therapy indicated for the treatment of adults with uveal melanoma with unresectable hepatic metastases affecting less than 50% of the liver and no extrahepatic disease or extrahepatic disease limited to the bone, lymph nodes, subcutaneous tissues, or lung that is amenable to resection or radiation.Melphalan is a nitrogen mustard or bischloroethylamine type alkylating agent. It was first synthesized in the early 1950s by substituting L-phenylalanine for the methyl group on nitrogen mustard. Melphalan is used in the treatment of multiple myeloma and ovarian carcinoma.

913,DB01043,"A more recent systemic review and meta-analysis  indicates that memantine is beneficial as a first line drug for the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia. Cholinesterase inhibitors may be added to memantine for further beneficial effects on behavioral symptoms and other symptoms of dementia .Initially approved by the FDA in 2013, memantine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist used in the management of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). In 2010, it was estimated that 36 million people worldwide live with Alzheimer's Disease. In 2013, this number increased to 44 million. The pharmacological effect of memantine likely occurs via the drug's behavior as an uncompetitive (open-channel) NMDA receptor antagonist, preventing glutamate action on this receptor."

It is also available as eye drops under the brand name ZymarÂ® marketed by Allergan. is bactericidal and its mode of action depends on blocking of bacterial DNA replication by binding itself to an enzyme called DNA gyrase, which allows the untwisting required to replicate one DNA double helix into two. Notably the drug has 100 times higher affinity for bacterial DNA gyrase than for mammalian. It should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria.The bactericidal action of Gatifloxacin results from inhibition of the enzymes topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV, which are required for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination."
915,DB01045,"Rifampin is indicated for the treatment of tuberculosis and tuberculosis-related mycobacterial infections.A semisynthetic antibiotic produced from Streptomyces mediterranei. In susceptible organisms it inhibits DNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity by forming a stable complex with the enzyme. It is bactericidal and has a very broad spectrum of activity against most gram-positive and gram-negative organisms (including Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and specifically Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Rifampin is well absorbed when taken orally and is distributed widely in body tissues and fluids, including the CSF. It is metabolized in the liver and eliminated in bile and, to a much lesser extent, in urine, but dose adjustments are unnecessary with renal insufficiency.Rifampin acts via the inhibition of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, leading to a suppression of RNA synthesis and cell death."
916,DB01046,"Lubiprostone is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic idiopathic constipation, or opioid-induced constipation in patients with chronic non-cancer pain. One approach to the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation is the secretion of fluid into the abdominal lumen through the activation of chloride channels in the apical membrane of the gastrointestinal epithelium. Lubiprostone is a locally acting chloride channel activator that increases intestinal chloride and fluid secretion without altering sodium and potassium concentrations in the serum.Lubiprostone acts by specifically activating ClC-2 chloride channels, which is a normal constituent of the apical membrane of the human intestine, in a protein kinase A action independent fashion. As a result, water follows sodium into the lumen in order to maintain isotonic equilibrium, thereby increasing intestinal fluid secretion. By increasing intestinal fluid secretion, lubiprostone increases motility in the intestine, thereby increasing the passage of stool and alleviating symptoms associated with chronic idiopathic constipation."
917,DB01047,"Fluocinonide is a potent glucocorticoid steroid used topically as anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment of skin disorders such as eczema. After binding the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Like other glucocorticoid agents Fluocinolone acetonide acts as a physiological antagonist to insulin by decreasing glycogenesis (formation of glycogen). There is also decreased glycogen formation in the liver."

Penicillin G may also be used in some cases as prophylaxis against susceptible organisms. Natural penicillins are considered the drugs of choice for several infections caused by susceptible gram positive aerobic organisms, such as *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, groups A, B, C and G streptococci, nonenterococcal group D streptococci, viridans group streptococci, and non-penicillinase producing staphylococcus. They are not generally used to treat anaerobic infections. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that penicillin G interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."
923,DB01054,"For the treatment of mild to moderate hypertensionNitrendipine is a calcium channel blocker with marked vasodilator action. It is an effective antihypertensive agent and differs from other calcium channel blockers in that it does not reduce glomerular filtration rate and is mildly natriuretic, rather than sodium retentive.Nitrendipine, a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker, is used alone or with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, to treat hypertension, chronic stable angina pectoris, and Prinzmetal's variant angina. Nitrendipine is similar to other peripheral vasodilators. Nitrendipine inhibits the influx of extra cellular calcium across the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes possibly by deforming the channel, inhibiting ion-control gating mechanisms, and/or interfering with the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The decrease in intracellular calcium inhibits the contractile processes of the myocardial smooth muscle cells, causing dilation of the coronary and systemic arteries, increased oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue, decreased total peripheral resistance, decreased systemic blood pressure, and decreased afterload.By deforming the channel, inhibiting ion-control gating mechanisms, and/or interfering with the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, Nitrendipine inhibits the influx of extracellular calcium across the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes The decrease in intracellular calcium inhibits the contractile processes of the myocardial smooth muscle cells, causing dilation of the coronary and systemic arteries, increased oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue, decreased total peripheral resistance, decreased systemic blood pressure, and decreased afterload."
924,DB01056,"For the treatment of documented ventricular arrhythmias, such as sustained ventricular tachycardia, that, in the judgment of the physician, are life-threatening.An antiarrhythmic agent which exerts a potential- and frequency-dependent block of sodium channels.Tocainide is a primary amine analog of lidocaine with antiarrhythmic properties useful in the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias. Tocainide, like lidocaine, produces dose dependent decreases in sodium and potassium conductance, thereby decreasing the excitability of myocardial cells. In experimental animal models, the dose-related depression of sodium current is more pronounced in ischemic tissue than in normal tissue. Tocainide is a Class I antiarrhythmic compound with electrophysiologic properties in man similar to those of lidocaine, but dissimilar from quinidine, procainamide, and disopyramide.Tocainide acts on sodium channels on the neuronal cell membrane, limiting the spread of seizure activity and reducing seizure propagation. Tocainide binds preferentially to the inactive state of the sodium channels.The antiarrhythmic actions are mediated through effects on sodium channels in Purkinje fibers."
925,DB01057,"For use in the treatment of subacute or chronic angle-closure glaucoma after iridectomy or where surgery is refused or contraindicated.A potent, long-acting irreversible cholinesterase inhibitor used as an ocular hypertensive in the treatment of glaucoma.

Echothiophate iodide will depress both plasma and erythrocyte cholinesterase levels in most patients after a few weeks of eyedrop therapy.Echothiophate Iodide is a long-acting cholinesterase inhibitor for topical use which enhances the effect of endogenously liberated acetylcholine in iris, ciliary muscle, and other parasympathetically innervated structures of the eye. Echothiophate iodide binds irreversibly to cholinesterase, and is long acting due to the slow rate of hydrolysis by cholinesterase. It causes miosis, increase in facility of outflow of aqueous humor, fall in intraocular pressure, and potentiation of accommodation."
926,DB01058,"Praziquantel is indicated in patients aged 1 year and older for the treatment of the schistosomiasis due to all species of Schistosoma (for example, Schistosoma mekongi, Schistosoma japonicum, Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma hematobium) and clonorchiasis and opisthorchiasis due to the liver flukes, Clonorchis sinensis/Opisthorchis viverrini (approval of this indication was based on studies in which the two species were not differentiated).Praziquantel is a pyrazino-isoquinolein derivative from the thioxantonic group used as a broad anthelmintic spectrum. Despite being approved since 1980, the exact mechanism of action is yet to be elucidated.In vitro studies on trematodes and cestodes have shown that praziquantel induces a rapid contraction of schistosomas by a specific effect on the permeability of the cell membrane. Praziquantel is active against schistosoma (for example, Schistosoma mekongi, Schistosoma japonicum, Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma hematobium), and infections due to the liver flukes, Clonorchis sinensis/Opisthorchis viverrini. An interesting quirk of praziquantel is that it is relatively ineffective against juvenile schistosomes. Effectiveness then increases again until it is once again fully effective at 6-7 weeks.Although the exact mechanism of action is unknown, praziquantel was hypothesized to target the Î² subunits of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, particularly in Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma japonicum, due to the lack of two conserved serine residues in these subunits."

It is used in the treatment of disorganized and psychotic thinking. It is also used to help treat false perceptions (e.g. hallucinations or delusions). It primarily targets the dopamine D2 receptor.Acetophenzine is a phenothiazine antipsychotic intended for the management of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.Acetophenazine blocks postsynaptic mesolimbic dopaminergic D1 and D2 receptors in the brain; depresses the release of hypothalamic and hypophyseal hormones and is believed to depress the reticular activating system thus affecting basal metabolism, body temperature, wakefulness, vasomotor tone, and emesis."
932,DB01064,"Isoprenaline is also indicated as an adjunct therapy to fluid and electrolyte replacement therapy in hypovolemic shock, septic shock, hypoperfusion, congestive heart failure, and cardiogenic shock.Isoprenaline is a non-selective beta adrenergic receptor agonist indicated to treat heart block, Adams-Stokes attacks, bronchospasm in anesthesia, cadiac arrest, hypovolemic shocks, septic shock, hypoperfusion, congestive hear failure, and cardiogenic shock. Isoprenaline was granted FDA approval on 19 February 1948.Isoprenaline is a non-selective beta adrenergic receptor agonist used in a number of indications for the heart, as well as bronchospasm in anesthesia. Agonism of beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors causes the alpha subunit of G-protein coupled receptors to exchange GMP for GTP, activating them, and allowing the alpha subunit to dissociate from the beta and gamma subunits. Cyclic AMP activates protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates cardiac L-type calcium channels such as Cav1.2. These channels depolarize cells by inward active transport of calcium ions."
933,DB01065,"A number of studies have shown that melatonin may be effective for treating sleep-wake cycle disturbances in children and adolescents with mental retardation, autism, and other central nervous system disorders. In mammals, melatonin is produced by the pineal gland. The melatonin receptors are G protein-coupled receptors and are expressed in various tissues of the body. MT1 receptor activation inhibits the adenylyl cyclase and its inhibition causes a rippling effect of non activation; starting with decreasing formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and then progressing to less protein kinase A (PKA) activity, which in turn hinders the phosphorilation of cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB binding protein) into P-CREB. The binding of melatonin to MT2 receptors inhibits adenylyl cyclase which decreases the formation of cAMP."
934,DB01066,"For the treatment of mild to moderate infections in adults and adolescents (12 years of age or older) which are caused by susceptible strains of microorganisms in acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, and uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections.

935,DB01067,"Glipizide is an oral hypoglycemic agent in the second-generation sulfonylurea drug class that is used to control blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Compared to other members of the sulfonylurea drug group, glipizide displays rapid absorption and onset of action with the shortest half-life and duration of action, reducing the risk for long-lasting hypoglycemia that is often observed with blood glucose-lowering agents. Chronic administration of glipizide may result in down-regulation of the sulfonylurea receptors on pancreatic beta cells, which are molecular targets of the drug, leading to a reduced effect on insulin secretion. In response to high blood glucose levels, insulin promotes the uptake of glucose into the liver, muscle cells, and fat cells for storage. Glipizide, like other sulfonylurea drugs, is an insulin secretagogue, which works by stimulating the insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells thereby increasing the plasma concentrations of insulin."
936,DB01068,"Additionally, clonazepam is also indicated for the treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, as defined in the DSM-V.    Alternatively, some regional prescribing information note that clonazepam is indicated for all clinical forms of epileptic disease and seizures in adults, especially absence seizures (petit mal) including atypical absence; primary or secondarily generalised tonic-clonic (grand mal), tonic or clonic seizures; partial (focal) seizures with elementary or complex symptomatology; various forms of myoclonic seizures, myoclonus and associated abnormal movements. The agent has also been indicated for treating panic disorder. Subsequently, benzodiazepines like clonazepam can bind to benzodiazepine receptors that are components of various varieties of GABA(a) receptors . This enhanced ligand binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA to the receptors increases the aforementioned chloride ion conduction (perhaps reportedly via an increase in the frequency of the chloride channel opening), resulting in a hyperpolarized cell membrane that prevents further excitation of the associated neuron cells . By enhancing the neuro-inhibitory activity of GABA, it is believed that clonazepam can facilitate in decreasing any excessive electrical nerve activity in the CNS that might be contributing to seizures ."
937,DB01069,"Promethazine antagonizes a variety of receptors, allowing it to be used for a number of indications including allergic reactions, pain, sedation, nausea, and vomiting. Promethazine was granted FDA approval before 29 March 1951.Promethazine is is a histamine H1 antagonist that can be used for it's ability to induce sedation, reduce pain, and treat allergic reactions. Promethazine's effects generally last 4-6h but can last up to 12h. Antagonism of muscarinic and NMDA receptors contribute to its use as a sleep aid, as well as for anxiety and tension. Antagonism of histamine H1, muscarinic, and dopamine receptors in the medullary vomiting center make promethazine useful in the treatment of nausea and vomiting."

It does not undergo further hydroxylation by the kidney and therefore is the analogue of 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Dihydrotachysterol is effective in the elevation of serum calcium by stimulating intestinal calcium absorption and mobilizing bone calcium in the absence of parathyroid hormone and of functioning renal tissue. Dihydrotachysterol also increases renal phosphate excretion.Once hydroxylated to 25-hydroxydihydrotachysterol, the modified drug binds to the vitamin D receptor. Vitamin D (when bound to the vitamin D receptor)stimulates the expression of a number of proteins involved in transporting calcium from the lumen of the intestine, across the epithelial cells and into blood. This stimulates intestinal calcium absorption and increases renal phosphate excretion."

It may cause neuropathy and hepatitis.Used in the treatment of unresponsive or refractory angina. Perhexiline increases glucose metabolism at the expense of free-fatty-acid metabolism, enhancing oxygen efficiency during myocardial ischaemia. Perhexiline also potentiates platelet responsiveness to nitric oxide both in patients with angina and patients with acute coronary syndrome. Perhexiline relieves symptoms of angina, improves exercise tolerance, and increases the workload needed to induce ischaemia when used as monotherapy."
942,DB01075,"However, it also has antiemetic, antitussive, hypnotic, and antiparkinson properties . As histamine receptors exist both peripherally and in the central nervous system, diphenhydramine has been shown to cause sedation due to its competitive antagonism of histamine H1 receptors within the central nervous system . The anti-histamine action occurs by blocking the spasmogenic and congestive effects of histamine by competing with histamine for H1 receptor sites on effector cells, preventing but not reversing responses mediated by histamine alone . Anti-vertigo action is by a central antimuscarinic effect on the vestibular apparatus and the integrative vomiting center and medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone of the midbrain .Diphenhydramine predominantly works via the antagonism of H1 (Histamine 1) receptors . Such H1 receptors are located on respiratory smooth muscles, vascular endothelial cells, the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), cardiac tissue, immune cells, the uterus, and the central nervous system (CNS) neurons ."
943,DB01076,"Atorvastatin can be used as a preventive agent for myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization, and angina, in patients without coronary heart disease but with multiple risk factors and in patients with type 2 diabetes without coronary heart disease but multiple risk factors. Several landmark studies demonstrate that the use of statins is associated with both a reduction in LDL levels and CVD risk. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Elevated cholesterol levels (and high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in particular) are an important risk factor for the development of CVD. Further studies have demonstrated statins affect Lp(a) levels differently in patients with dyslipidemia depending on their apo(a) phenotype; statins increase Lp(a) levels exclusively in patients with the low molecular weight apo(a) phenotype.Atorvastatin is a statin medication and a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis."

A cardiotonic glycoside from the leaves of Digitalis lanata.Deslanoside is a cardiac glycoside used to treat congestive heart failure and supraventricular arrhythmias due to reentry mechanisms, and to control ventricular rate in the treatment of chronic atrial fibrillation.Deslanoside inhibits the Na-K-ATPase membrane pump, resulting in an increase in intracellular sodium and calcium concentrations. Increased intracellular concentrations of calcium may promote activation of contractile proteins (e.g., actin, myosin). Deslanoside also acts on the electrical activity of the heart, increasing the slope of phase 4 depolarization, shortening the action potential duration, and decreasing the maximal diastolic potential."
946,DB01079,"Tegaserod is a serotonin-4 (5-HT4) receptor agonist indicated for the treatment of adult women less than 65 years of age with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) . Despite the relative complications involved in its history of regulatory approval, ever since its first introduction in 2002 tegaserod remains the only therapy for IBS-C that possesses the unique mechanism of action of acting on serotonin-4 (5-HT(4)) receptors in smooth muscle cells and in the gastrointestinal wall to facilitate actions like esophageal relaxation, peristaltic gut movement, and natural secretions in the gut, among others.In general, it has been determined that tegaserod is an agonist of serotonin type-4 (5-HT(4)) receptors, an antagonist at 5-HT(2B) receptors, but is expected to possess minimal binding to 5-HT(1) receptors, and virtually no affinity for 5-HT(3) or dopamine receptors . An increase in QTcF of 30 to 60 ms was observed in 7% of patients receiving tegaserod and 8% receiving placebo . Furthermore, it was determined that there is a potential for tegaserod and its main metabolite (the M29 metabolite) to increase platelet aggregation in vitro . Subsequently, because tegaserod is considered to be an agonist of the 5-HT(4) receptor and an antagonist of the 5-HT(2B) receptor at clinically relevant levels, it is believed that tegaserod may elicit its mechanism of action by facilitating activities associated with the activation and antagonism of the 5-HT(4) and 5-HT(2B) receptors, like stimulating peristaltic gastrointestinal reflexes and intestinal secretion, inhibiting visceral sensitivity, enhancing basal motor activity, and normalizing impaired motility throughout the gastrointestinal tract, among other actions ."
947,DB01080,"Vigabatrin is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of refractory complex partial seizures in patients 2 years of age and older who have had inadequate responses to multiple previous treatments (i.e. not to be used for first-line therapy). Although administered as a racemic mixture, only the S(+) enantiomer is pharmacologically active. It was first introduced as an antiepileptic agent in the United Kingdom in 1989 and was used extensively until 1997, when an association with vision loss became apparent. Vigabatrin prevents the metabolism of GABA by irreversibly inhibiting GABA transaminase (GABA-T). Vigabatrin increases concentrations of GABA in the central nervous system by irreversibly inhibiting the enzymes responsible for its metabolism to succinic semialdehyde: gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase (GABA-T)."

When diphenoxylate is used alone, it is classified as a Schedule II.Diphenoxylate, an antidiarrheal, is effective as adjunctive therapy in the management of diarrhea. Diphenoxylate has a direct effect on circular smooth muscle of the bowel, that conceivably results in segmentation and prolongation of gastrointestinal transit time."
949,DB01082,"The second âenergy-dependent phase Iâ of aminoglycoside entry into the cytoplasm relies on the proton-motive force and allows a limited amount of aminoglycoside access to its primary intracellular target - the bacterial 30S ribosome. This ultimately results in the mistranslation of proteins and disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane. Aminoglycoside rapidly accumulates in the cell due to the damaged cytoplasmic membrane, and protein mistranslation and synthesis inhibition is amplified. Inhibition of protein synthesis is a key component of aminoglycoside efficacy. Recent evidence suggests that the latter effect is due to a cryptic second binding site situated in h69 of the 23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit."

Orlistat in the 120 mg prescription formulation is also indicated to reduce the risk of weight regain following weight loss.The global prevalence of obesity is increasing rapidly. Obesity-related complications lead to significant personal and economic burden by reducing quality of life and increasing the cost of healthcare. In some individuals, diet and exercise are insufficient to maintain weight loss, and pharmacological or surgical intervention is required. It was approved by the FDA for use in combination with a reduced-calorie diet in 1999. This drug is a generally well-tolerated and effective weight-loss aid and is now available in both over-the-counter and prescription preparations, depending on the dosage quantity.Orlistat helps with weight reduction and maintenance by inhibiting the absorption of dietary fats via the inhibition of lipase enzymes.Orlistat is a potent and selective inhibitor of various lipase enzymes responsible for the metabolism of fat."
951,DB01084,"For the temporary relief of the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis.Emedastine is an antihistamine used in eye drops to treat allergic conjunctivitis.Emedastine is a relatively selective H1-receptor antagonist.Emedastine is a relatively selective, histamine H1 antagonist. In vitro examinations of emedastine's affinity for histamine receptors demonstrate relative selectivity for the H1 histamine receptor. In vivo studies have shown concentration-dependent inhibition of histamine-stimulated vascular permeability in the conjunctiva following topical ocular administration. Emedastine appears exert negligible effects on adrenergic, dopaminergic and serotonin receptors."
952,DB01085,"Pilocarpine is associated with parasympathomimetic effects by selectively working on muscarinic receptors. Pilocarpine is used to treat dry mouth and various ophthalmic conditions, including elevated intraocular pressure and glaucoma. Because pilocarpine may affect all five muscarinic receptor subtypes, it is associated with parasympathetic side effects.The muscarinic M3 receptor is expressed in various endocrine and exocrine glands, including the gastric and salivary glands. It is also found in smooth muscle cells in pupillary sphincter and ciliary bodies. Pilocarpine is an agonist for M1 and M2 receptors, and is a full and partial agonist at the M3 receptor."
953,DB01086,"Benzocaine products are indicated for topical anesthesia in a wide variety of conditions including skin irritation, oral pain, and hemorrhoids.Benzocaine is an ester local anesthetic that acts by preventing transmission of impulses along nerve fibers and at nerve endings. It is commonly used for local anesthesia in many over the counter products. Benzocaine was first used for local anesthesia in dentistry.Benzocaine is indicated for use as a topical anesthetic. It has a duration of action of approximately 10 minutes and a wide therapeutic window. Patients should be counselled regarding the risks of methemoglobinemia.Benzocaine diffuses into nerve cells where it binds to sodium channels, preventing the channels from opening, and blocking the influx of sodium ions."
954,DB01087,"It has also been used to prevent transmission of falciparum malaria by those returning to areas where there is a potential for re-introduction of malaria. To prevent it from being damaged, the malaria parasite produces an chemical which converts the toxic haem into a non-toxic product. Primaquine acts by interfering with a part of the parasite (mitochondria) that is responsible for supplying it with energy. Primaquine is not used in the prevention of malaria, only in the treatment. It has insignificant activity against the asexual blood forms of the parasite and therefore it is always used in conjunction with a blood schizonticide and never as a single agent."
955,DB01088,"Iloprost is indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (WHO Group 1) to improve a composite endpoint consisting of exercise tolerance, symptoms (NYHA Class), and lack of deterioration. It is also indicated for the treatment of severe frostbite in adults to reduce the risk of digit amputations. Iloprost consists of a mixture of the 4R and 4S diastereoisomers at a ratio of approximately 53:47. It is a potent vasodilator with reported anti-thrombotic properties.Iloprost is a synthetic analogue of prostacyclin PGI2 that dilates systemic and pulmonary arterial vascular beds. It was shown to inhibit platelet aggregation, but whether this effect contributes to its vasodilatory action has not been elucidated."
956,DB01089,"For the treatment of hypertension.Deserpidine is an ester alkaloid drug isolated from Rauwolfia canescens (family Apocynaceae) with antipsychotic and antihypertensive properties that has been used for the control of high blood pressure and for the relief of psychotic behavior.Deserpidine, an alkaloid of Rauwolfia canescens, is used as an antihypertensive. Rauwolfia alkaloids work by controlling nerve impulses along certain nerve pathways. As a result, they act on the heart and blood vessels to lower blood pressure.Deserpidine's mechanism of action is through inhibition of the ATP/Mg2+ pump responsible for the sequestering of neurotransmitters into storage vesicles located in the presynaptic neuron. The neurotransmitters that are not sequestered in the storage vesicle are readily metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO) causing a reduction in catecholamines."
957,DB01090,"Used to produce controlled hypotension during surgical procedures and in hypertensive crises.Pentolinium is a nicotinic antagonist that has been used as a ganglionic blocking agent in hypertension.Pentolinium acts as a ganglionic blocking agent. Pentolinium inhibits release of adrenaline and noradrenaline from adrenergic nerves. It is used as an antihypertensive, and can be administered orally, intramuscularly, and subcutaneously.Pentolinium binds to the nicotinic (ganglion) acetylcholine receptor. This receptor/channel is permeable to a range of divalent cations including calcium, the influx of which may activate a potassium current which hyperpolarizes the cell membrane. Blockage of the receptor leads to smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilaton."
958,DB01092,"For the treatment of atrial fibrillation and flutter and heart failureA cardioactive glycoside consisting of rhamnose and ouabagenin, obtained from the seeds of Strophanthus gratus and other plants of the Apocynaceae; used like digitalis. It is commonly used in cell biological studies as an inhibitor of the NA(+)-K(+)-exchanging ATPase.Ouabain, a cardiac glycoside similar to digitoxin, is used to treat congestive heart failure and supraventricular arrhythmias due to reentry mechanisms, and to control ventricular rate in the treatment of chronic atrial fibrillation.Ouabain inhibits the Na-K-ATPase membrane pump, resulting in an increase in intracellular sodium and calcium concentrations. Increased intracellular concentrations of calcium may promote activation of contractile proteins (e.g., actin, myosin). Ouabain also acts on the electrical activity of the heart, increasing the slope of phase 4 depolarization, shortening the action potential duration, and decreasing the maximal diastolic potential."
959,DB01093,"Because of its ability to penetrate biological membranes, it is used as a vehicle for topical application of pharmaceuticals. Dimethyl Sulfoxide also readily penetrates cellular membranes. The membrane-penetrating ability of dimethyl sulfoxide may enhance diffusion of other substances through the skin. For this reason, mixtures of idoxuridine and dimethyl sulfoxide have been used for topical treatment of herpes zoster in the United Kingdom.The mechanism of dimethyl sulfoxide's actions is not well understood. It is also thought that dimethyl sulfoxide's possible anti-inflammatory activity is due to antioxidant action."
960,DB01095,"Fluvastatin belongs to a class of medications called statins and is used to reduce plasma cholesterol levels and prevent cardiovascular disease. It is also the first entirely synthetic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and is structurally distinct from the fungal derivatives of this therapeutic class. Fluvastatin is a racemate comprising equimolar amounts of (3R,5S)- and (3S,5R)-fluvastatin.Fluvastatin, the first synthetically-derived HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, is a hydrophilic, acidic, antilipemic agent used to lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels associated with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia (Fredrickson types IIa and IIb), to slow the progression of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with CHD and as secondary prevention therapy in patients with CHD to reduce the risk of requiring coronary revascularization procedures. Although similar to lovastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin, fluvastatin has a shorter half-life, no active metabolites, extensive protein binding, and minimal CSF penetration. HMG-CoA reductase is responsible for converting HMG-CoA to mevalonate, the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis."
961,DB01096,"For treatment of Schistosomiasis caused by Schistosoma mansoni An anthelmintic with schistosomicidal activity against Schistosoma mansoni, but not against other Schistosoma spp. Oxamniquine causes worms to shift from the mesenteric veins to the liver where the male worms are retained; the female worms return to the mesentery, but can no longer release eggs. (From Martidale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 31st ed, p121)Oxamniquine is an anthelmintic with schistosomicidal activity against Schistosoma mansoni, but not against other Schistosoma spp. Oxamniquine causes worms to shift from the mesenteric veins to the liver where the male worms are retained; the female worms return to the mesentery, but can no longer release egg.Oxamniquine may associate with an irreversible inhibition of the nucleic acid metabolism of the parasites. A hypothesis has been put forth that the drug is activated by a single step, in which a schistosome sulfotransferase enzyme converts oxamniquine into an ester (probably acetate, phosphate, or sulfate)."
962,DB01097,"Has also been used for the prevention of acute and chronic rejection in recipients of solid organ trasnplants and is designated by the FDA as an orphan drug for this use.Leflunomide is a pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor belonging to the DMARD (disease-modifying antirheumatic drug) class of drugs, which are chemically and pharmacologically very heterogeneous. Leflunomide was approved by FDA and in many other countries (e.g., Canada, Europe) in 1999.Leflunomide is a pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor indicated in adults for the treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Therefore, activated T cells, which are dependent on de novo pyrimidine synthesis, will be more affected by leflunomide's inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase than other cell types that use the salvage pathway of pyrimidine synthesis.Leflunomide is a prodrug that is rapidly and almost completely metabolized following oral administration to its pharmacologically active metabolite, A77 1726. It has been suggested that leflunomide exerts its immunomodulating effects by preventing the expansion of activated autoimmune lymphocytes via interferences with cell cycle progression. Inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase by A77 1726 prevents production of rUMP by the de novo pathway; such inhibition leads to decreased rUMP levels, decreased DNA and RNA synthesis, inhibition of cell proliferation, and G1 cell cycle arrest."
963,DB01098,"More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as ""bad cholesterol""), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. Rosuvastatin is also a unique member of the class of statins due to its high hydrophilicity which increases hepatic uptake at the site of action, low bioavailability, and minimal metabolism via the Cytochrome P450 system. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The risk of myopathy during treatment with rosuvastatin may be increased with concurrent administration of some other lipid-lowering therapies (such as  or ), , , /, /ritonavir, or ."
964,DB01099,"For the treatment (in combination with amphotericin B) of serious infections caused by susceptible strains of Candida (septicemia, endocarditis and urinary system infections) and/or Cryptococcus (meningitis and pulmonary infections).A fluorinated cytosine analog that is used as an antifungal agent.Flucytosine is an antimetabolite that acts as an antifungal agent with in vitro and in vivo activity against Candida and Cryptococcus. Flucytosine enters the fungal cell via cytosine permease; thus, flucytosine is metabolized to 5-fluorouracil within fungal organisms. The 5-fluorouracil is extensively incorporated into fungal RNA and inhibits synthesis of both DNA and RNA. The result is unbalanced growth and death of the fungal organism. Antifungal synergism between Ancobon and polyene antibiotics, particularly amphotericin B, has been reported.Although the exact mode of action is unknown, it has been proposed that flucytosine acts directly on fungal organisms by competitive inhibition of purine and pyrimidine uptake and indirectly by intracellular metabolism to 5-fluorouracil."
965,DB01100,"Used for the suppression of motor and phonic tics in patients with Tourette's Disorder who have failed to respond satisfactorily to standard treatment.A diphenylbutylpiperidine that is effective as an antipsychotic agent and as an alternative to haloperidol for the suppression of vocal and motor tics in patients with Tourette syndrome. Although the precise mechanism of action is unknown, blockade of postsynaptic dopamine receptors has been postulated. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1994, p403)Pimozide is an orally active antipsychotic drug product which shares with other antipsychotics the ability to blockade dopaminergic receptors on neurons in the central nervous system. However, receptor blockade is often accompanied by a series of secondary alterations in central dopamine metabolism and function which may contribute to both pimozide's therapeutic and untoward effects. In addition, pimozide, in common with other antipsychotic drugs, has various effects on other central nervous system receptor systems which are not fully characterized."
966,DB01101,"Capecitabine is a prodrug, that is enzymatically converted to fluorouracil (antimetabolite) in the tumor, where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumor tissue.Capecitabine is a fluoropyrimidine carbamate belonging to a group of antineoplastic agents called antimetabolites, which kill cancerous cells by interfering with DNA synthesis. If correctly positioned, dUMP, CH2THF, and TS would form a ternary complex to facilitate the donation of the methyl group from CH2THF to dUMP. TS inhibition prevents the conversion of dUMP to dTMP, depleting the pool of dTMP that could be phosphorylated into dTTP to be incorporated as DNA nucleotides. Repeated base excision repair can result in abasic sites, which can lead to DNA mutagenesis and thus protein miscoding, replication forks collapse, and DNA fragmentation through single or double strand breaks      However, several reports have found that the incorporation of uracil in genomic DNA does not significantly affect the cytotoxicity of 5-FU, suggesting that the cytotoxic effect of 5-FU is dominated by the perturbation of RNA through 5-FUTP. Although the main mechanism of 5-FU cytotoxicity was thought to be attributed to DNA damages, recent reports have shown that the majority of 5-FU pharmacological action is mediated through RNA, since 5-FU is accumulated ~3000- to 15â000-fold more in RNA compared to that of DNA."
967,DB01102,"Used to elicit acute cardiovascular responses (cardiac stumulant), similar to those produced by exercise, in order to aid in diagnosing the presence or absence of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients who cannot exercise adequately.Arbutamine, administered through a closed-loop, computer-controlled drug-delivery system, is indicated to elicit acute cardiovascular responses, similar to those produced by exercise, in order to aid in diagnosing the presence or absence of coronary artery disease in patients who cannot exercise adequately .Arbutamine is a synthetic catecholamine with positive chronotropic and inotropic properties. The chronotropic (increase in heart rate) and inotropic (increase in force of contraction) effects of arbutamine serve to mimic exercise by increasing cardiac work (producing stress) and provoke myocardial ischemia in patients with compromised coronary arteries. The increase in heart rate caused by arbutamine is thought to limit regional subendocardial perfusion, thereby limiting tissue oxygenation. In functional assays, arbutamine is more selective for beta-adrenergic receptors than for alpha-adrenergic receptors. The degree of hypotension that occurs for a given chronotropic activity is less with arbutamine than, for example, with isoproterenol because alpha receptor activity is retained."
968,DB01104,"Sertraline is indicated for the management of major depressive disorder (MDD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder (PD), premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), and social anxiety disorder (SAD). Sertraline is a popular antidepressant medication commonly known as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and is similar to drugs such as  and . Despite marked structural differences between compounds in this drug class, SSRIs exert similar pharmacological effects. In animal studies, chronic administration of sertraline results in down-regulation of brain norepinephrine receptors. In vitro, sertraline shows little to no affinity for GABA, dopaminergic, serotonergic (5HT1A, 5HT1B, 5HT2), or benzodiazepine receptors."
969,DB01105,"For the treatment of obesity. Sibutramine (trade name Meridia in the USA, Reductil in Europe and other countries), usually as sibutramide hydrochloride monohydrate, is an orally administered agent for the treatment of obesity. The parent compound, sibutramine, is a potent inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake in vivo, but not in vitro. However, metabolites M1 and M2 inhibit the reuptake of these neurotransmitters both in vitro and in vivo. In human brain tissue, M1 and M2 also inhibit dopamine reuptake in vitro, but with ~3-fold lower potency than for the reuptake inhibition of serotonin or norepinephrine."
970,DB01106,"As an ophthalmic for the temporary relief of the signs and symptoms of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis. Levocabastine was discovered at Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1979.Levocabastine is a selective histamine H1-receptor antagonist exerting inhibitory effects on the release of chemical mediators from mast cells and on the chemotaxis of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and eosinophils. Both histamine and antigens induced conjunctivitis can be inhibited by levocabastine. Levocabastine can also reduce symptoms of allergic rhinitis by preventing an increase in vascular permeability of nasal mucosa.Levocabastine is a potent, selective histamine H1-receptor antagonist. It thereby prevents, but does not reverse, responses mediated by histamine alone."
971,DB01107,"For the treatment of insomnia.Methyprylon is a sedative of the piperidinedione derivative family that was previously used for the treatment of insomnia. However, with the introduction of newer drugs with fewer side effects, such as benzodiazepines, the clinical use of methyprylon is now limited. Methyprylon was withdrawn from the U.S. market in June 1965 and the Canadian market in September 1990 due to adverse events.Methyprylon, a piperidinedione CNS depressant, is close to barbituric acid in structure, but different enough to be called a ""non-barbiturate"" sedative-hynotic. Methyprylon is used for insomnia and daytime tension. Methyprylon depresses the activity of muscle tissues, the heart, and the respiratory system.Methyprylon binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl- ionopore at the GABAA receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl- ionopore is open."
972,DB01108,"Used in the treatment of Cushing's syndrome. It was withdrawn from the United States market in April 1994.Trilostane blocks an enzyme involved in the production of several steroids including cortisol. In Cushing's syndrome, the adrenal gland overproduces steroids. Although steroids are important for various functions of the body, too much can cause problems. This product was withdrawn from the U.S. market in April 1994.Trilostane produces suppression of the adrenal cortex by inhibiting enzymatic conversion of steroids by 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/delta 5,4 ketosteroid isomerase, thus blocking synthesis of adrenal steroids."
973,DB01109,"It binds reversibly to antithrombin III (ATIII) and greatly accelerates the rate at which ATIII inactivates coagulation enzymes thrombin (factor IIa) and factor Xa. UH is different from low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in the following ways: the average molecular weight of LMWH is about 4.5 kDa whereas it is 15 kDa for UH; UH requires continuous infusions; activated partial prothrombin time (aPTT) monitoring is required when using UH; and UH has a higher risk of bleeding and higher risk of osteoporosis in long term use. Small amounts of heparin in combination with antithrombin III, a heparin cofactor,) can inhibit thrombosis by inactivating Factor Xa and thrombin. Of all the coagulation tests, activated partial prothrombin time (aPTT) is the most clinically important value.Under normal circumstances, antithrombin III (ATIII) inactivates thrombin (factor IIa) and factor Xa. It prevents progression of existing clots by inhibiting further clotting."
974,DB01110,"Miconazole is available as both a suppository and cream for the treatment of vaginal yeast infections and the relief of associated vulvar itching and irritation. Lastly, miconazole cream is effective in treating athlete's foot (tinea pedis), jock itch (tinea cruris), ringworm infections (tinea corporis), pityriasis (formerly tinea) versicolor, and cutaneous candidiasis.Miconazole is a broad-spectrum azole antifungal with some activity against Gram-positive bacteria as well. Miconazole is thought to act primarily through the inhibition of fungal CYP450 14Î±-lanosterol demethylase activity. Patients using intravaginal miconazole products are advised not to rely on contraceptives to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, as well as not to use tampons concurrently.Miconazole is an azole antifungal used to treat a variety of conditions, including those caused by _Candida_ overgrowth. In addition, miconazole inhibits fungal peroxidase and catalase while not affecting NADH oxidase activity, leading to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)."
975,DB01111,"For the treatment of acute or chronic infections due to sensitive strains of certain gram-negative bacilli, particularly _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_.Colistimethate is an antibiotic that has been shown to have bactericidal activity against aerobic gram-negative microorganisms. Originally, colistimethate sodium was thought to be less toxic than polymyxin B; however, if the drugs are administered at comparable doses, their toxicities may be similar. Polymyxins are cationic polypeptides that disrupt the bacterial cell membrane through a detergentlike mechanism. Colistimethate is polycationic and has both hydrophobic and lipophilic moieties. It interacts with the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane, changing its permeability."
976,DB01112,"Cefuroxime is a Î²-lactam type antibiotic. More specifically, it is a second-generation cephalosporin. Cephalosporins work the same way as penicillins: they interfere with the peptidoglycan synthesis of the bacterial wall by inhibiting the final transpeptidation needed for the cross-links. Cefuroxime axetil is the prodrug Cefuroxime, like the penicillins, is a beta-lactam antibiotic. By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, it inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis."
977,DB01113,"It is a direct-acting smooth muscle relaxant used in the treatment of impotence and as a vasodilator, especially for cerebral vasodilation. The main actions of Papaverine are exerted on cardiac and smooth muscle. Like qathidine, Papaverine acts directly on the heart muscle to depress conduction and prolong the refractory period. Papaverine relaxes various smooth muscles. This relaxation may be prominent if spasm exists."
978,DB01114,"It has also been used in veterinary applications. One of the most widely used of the classical antihistaminics, it generally causes less drowsiness and sedation than promethazine.In allergic reactions an allergen interacts with and cross-links surface IgE antibodies on mast cells and basophils. Once the mast cell-antibody-antigen complex is formed, a complex series of events occurs that eventually leads to cell-degranulation and the release of histamine (and other chemical mediators) from the mast cell or basophil. Once released, histamine can react with local or widespread tissues through histamine receptors. It provides effective, temporary relief of sneezing, watery and itchy eyes, and runny nose due to hay fever and other upper respiratory allergies.Chlorpheniramine binds to the histamine H1 receptor."
979,DB01115,"Nifedipine capsules are indicated to treat vasospastic angina and chronic stable angina. Extended release tablets are indicated to treat vasospastic angina, chronic stable angina, and hypertension.Nifedipine, or BAY a 1040, is a first generation dihydropyridine L-type calcium channel blocker, similar to . Since nifedipine's development, second and third generation dihydropyridines have been developed with slower onsets and longer durations of action. Nifedipine was granted FDA approval on 31 December 1981.Nifedipine is an inhibitor of L-type voltage gated calcium channels that reduces blood pressure and increases oxygen supply to the heart. Immediate release nifedipine's duration of action requires dosing 3 times daily."

Additional effects may include direct peripheral vasodilation and release of histamine. Trimethaphan's hypotensive effect is due to reduction in sympathetic tone and vasodilation, and is primarily postural."
981,DB01117,"For the treatment or prevention of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in patients who are intolerant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). Atovaquone is a highly lipophilic drug that closely resembles the structure ubiquinone. Its inhibitory effect being comparable to ubiquinone, atovaquone can act by selectively affecting mitochondrial electron transport and parallel processes such as ATP and pyrimidine biosynthesis in atovaquone-responsive parasites. Cytochrome bc1 complex (complex III) seems to serve as a highly discriminating molecular target for atovaquone in Plasmodia. Inhibition of electron transport by atovaquone will result in indirect inhibition of these enzymes."
982,DB01118,"The FDA emphasizes that this drug should only be given in these conditions when they are clinically documented and have not responded to normal therapeutic doses of other antiarrhythmic agents, or when other drugs are not tolerated by the patient. Off-label indications include atrial fibrillation and supraventricular tachycardia.Amiodarone is a benzofuran derivative, anti-arrhythmic drug used commonly in a variety of settings. Most known for its approved indication in life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, it is also used off-label in the outpatient and inpatient setting for atrial fibrillation. Thyrotoxicosis or hypothyroidism may also result from the administration of amiodarone, which contains high levels of iodine, and interferes with normal thyroid function.Amiodarone is considered a class III anti-arrhythmic drug. As a result amiodarone increases the duration of the action potential as well as the effective refractory period for cardiac cells (myocytes)."
983,DB01119,"Diazoxide may also be used parentally or intravenously to treat hypertensive emergencies.Diazoxide is a non-diuretic benzothiadiazine derivative that activates ATP-sensitive potassium channels. The hypotensive effects of diazoxide are usually not detected when administered orally. The use of intravenous or oral diazoxide may lead to the development of pulmonary hypertension in infants and neonates.Diazoxide is a nondiuretic benzothiadiazine derivative used for the management of symptomatic hypoglycemia. This hyperpolarizes the cell membrane and prevents the influx of calcium to the pancreatic betaâcells. The mechanism of action of its hypotensive effect has not been fully elucidated; however, it is possible that it involves the antagonism of calcium."
984,DB01120,"Gliclazide belongs to the sulfonylurea class of insulin secretagogues, which act by stimulating &beta; cells of the pancreas to release insulin. Sulfonylureas also increase peripheral glucose utilization, decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis and may increase the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors. Due to their mechanism of action, sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia and require consistent food intake to decrease this risk. Overall, it potentiates insulin release and improves insulin dynamics.Gliclazide binds to the &beta; cell sulfonyl urea receptor (SUR1). The binding results in closure of the channels and leads to a resulting decrease in potassium efflux leads to depolarization of the &beta; cells."
985,DB01121,"Used to control certain seizures in the treatment of epilepsy.Phenacemide is used to control certain seizures in the treatment of epilepsy. This medicine acts on the central nervous system (CNS) to reduce the number and severity of seizures.Phenacemide is a ureal anticonvulsant indicated for control of severe epilepsy, particularly mixed forms of complex partial (psychomotor or temporal lobe) seizures, refractory to other anticonvulsants. Phenacemide elevates the threshold for minimal electroshock convulsions and abolishes the tonic phase of maximal electroshock seizures. It also prevents or modifies seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol or other convulsants.Phenacemide binds to and blocks neuronal sodium channels or voltage sensitive calcium channels. This blocks or suppresses neuronal depolarization and hypersynchronization."
986,DB01122,"Ambenonium is used to treat muscle weakness due to muscle disease (myasthenia gravis).Ambenonium is a cholinesterase inhibitor. It is used in the management of myasthenia gravis.Ambenonium, similar to pyridostigmine and neostigmine, is used for the treatment of muscle weakness and fatigue in people with myasthenia gravis. It is postulated to exert its therapeutic effect by enhancing cholinergic function through the inhibition of the acetylcholine hydrolysis by acetylcholinesterase. Increased levels of acetylcholine has peripheral effects, as acetylcholine is also used in the brain, where it tends to cause excitatory actions. The glands that receive impulses from the parasympathetic part of the autonomic nervous system are also stimulated in the same way."
987,DB01124,"It is structurally similar to acetohexamide, chlorpropamide and tolazamide and belongs to the sulfonylurea class of insulin secretagogues, which act by stimulating Î² cells of the pancreas to release insulin. Sulfonylureas also increase peripheral glucose utilization, decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis and may increase the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors. Sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain, though less so than insulin. Due to their mechanism of action, sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia and require consistent food intake to decrease this risk. The pancreas must be able to produce insulin for this drug to work.Sulfonylureas lower blood glucose in patients with NIDDM by directly stimulating the acute release of insulin from functioning beta cells of pancreatic islet tissue by an unknown process that involves a sulfonylurea receptor (receptor 1) on the beta cell."
988,DB01126,"Type I and II 5Î±-reductase enzymes convert testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a primary hormonal mediator that plays a role in the development and enlargement of the prostate gland. However, unlike finasteride, dutasteride is not yet indicated for the treatment of androgenic alopecia although it was demonstrated to be effective in several randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in androgenetic alopecia.Dutasteride is a synthetic 4-azasteroid compound that selectively inhibits both the type I and type II isoforms of steroid 5Î±-reductase, an intracellular enzyme that converts testosterone to 5Î±-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Dutasteride works by reducing the levels of circulating DHT. Compared to a 70% reduction of serum DHT levels caused by , a near-complete suppression of serum DHT-more than 90% is seen with dutasteride. By forming a stable complex with both type II and type II 5Î±-reductase, dutasteride inhibits its enzymatic action of converting testosterone to 5Î±-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is the androgen primarily responsible for the initial development and subsequent enlargement of the prostate gland."

990,DB01128,"Bicalutamide is indicated in combination with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist for the treatment of Stage D2 metastatic carcinoma of the prostate.Bicalutamide is an oral non-steroidal anti-androgen for prostate cancer. It is comprised of a racemic mixture that is a 50:50 composition of the (R)-bicalutamide and (S)-bicalutamide enantionmers. Bicalutamide binds to the androgen receptor.Bicalutamide is an antineoplastic hormonal agent primarily used in the treatment of prostate cancer. Prostate cancer is mostly androgen-dependent and can be treated with surgical or chemical castration. To date, antiandrogen monotherapy has not consistently been shown to be equivalent to castration.Bicalutamide competes with androgen for the binding of androgen receptors, consequently blocking the action of androgens of adrenal and testicular origin which stimulate the growth of normal and malignant prostatic tissue."
991,DB01129,"Rabeprazole is an antiulcer drug in the class of proton pump inhibitors. It reduces symptoms and prevents injury to the esophagus or stomach in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or ulcers. Rabeprazole is a selective and irreversible proton pump inhibitor, suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+, K+ -ATPase, which is found at the secretory surface of parietal cells. Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, rabeprazole has been characterized as a gastric proton-pump inhibitor. In gastric parietal cells, rabeprazole is protonated, accumulates, and is transformed to an active sulfenamide."
992,DB01130,"For the relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses.Prednicarbate is a relatively new topical corticosteroid drug that displays a similar potency as . It is used in the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis. It has a favorable benefit-risk ratio, with an inflammatory action similar to that of a medium potency corticosteroid, but with a low potential to cause skin atrophy. The anti-inflammation action of corticosteroids is associated with the inhibition of the interleukin 1-alpha cytokine within keratinocytes. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2."
993,DB01131,"For the causal prevention and suppression of malaria caused by susceptible strains of P. falciparum and other species of Plasmodium found in some geographical areas of the world.Proguanil is a prophylactic antimalarial drug, which works by stopping the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, from reproducing once it is in the red blood cells. It does this by inhibiting the enzyme, dihydrofolate reductase, which is involved in the reproduction of the parasite.Proguanil is a biguanide derivative that is converted to an active metabolite called cycloguanil. It exerts its antimalarial action by inhibiting parasitic dihydrofolate reductase enzyme. However it is slower compared to 4-aminoquinolines.Proguanil inhibits the dihydrofolate reductase of plasmodia and thereby blocks the biosynthesis of purines and pyrimidines, which are essential for DNA synthesis and cell multiplication. This leads to failure of nuclear division at the time of schizont formation in erythrocytes and liver."
994,DB01132,"Pioglitazone is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is also available in combination with , , or  for the same indication.Pioglitazone is an antihyperglycemic used as an adjunct to diet, exercise, and other antidiabetic medications to manage type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is administered as a racemic mixture, though there is no pharmacologic difference between the enantiomers and they appear to interconvert _in vivo_ with little consequence. The thiazolidinedione class of medications, which also includes  and , exerts its pharmacological effect primarily by promoting insulin sensitivity and the improved uptake of blood glucose via agonism at the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARÎ³). Pioglitazone should not be used in patients with active bladder cancer and should be used with caution in patients with a history of bladder cancer.Pioglitazone is a selective agonist at peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARÎ³) in target tissues for insulin action such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver."
995,DB01133,"These drugs were developed to mimic the action of pyrophosphate, a regulator of calcification and decalcification. Tiludronic acid was first described in the literature in 1988 as a potential treatment for Paget's disease of bone. Bone resorption by osteoclasts causes local acidification, releasing the bisphosphonate, which is taken into the osteoclast by fluid-phase endocytosis. When osteoclasts bind to bone they form podosomes, ring structures of F-actin. Disruption of the podosomes causes osteoclasts to detach from bones, preventing bone resorption."
996,DB01135,"Used to provide skeletal muscle relaxation as an adjunct to general anesthesia, for endotracheal intubation or to facilitate mechanical ventilation.Doxacurium chloride is a long-acting, nondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxant for intravenous administration.Doxacurium chloride is a long-acting, nondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxant. The neuromuscular block produced by doxacurium chloride may be antagonized by anticholinesterase agents. As with other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents, the more profound the neuromuscular block at reversal, the longer the time and the greater the dose of anticholinesterase required for recovery of neuromuscular function. Doxacurium chloride is approximately 2.5 to 3 times more potent than pancuronium and 10 to 12 times more potent than metocurine.Doxacurium chloride binds competitively to cholinergic receptors on the motor end-plate to antagonize the action of acetylcholine, resulting in a block of neuromuscular transmission (non-depolarizing). This action is antagonized by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as neostigmine."
997,DB01136,"Carvedilol is indicated to treat mild to severe heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction with ventricular ejection fraction â¤40%, or hypertension.Carvedilol is a racemic mixture where the S(-) enantiomer is both a beta and alpha-1 adrenoceptor blocker, and the R(+) enantiomer is an alpha-1 adrenoceptor blocker. It is currently used to treat heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction, and hypertension. The dual action of carvedilol is advantageous in combination therapies as moderate doses of 2 drugs have a decreased incidence of adverse effects compared to high dose monotherapy in the treatment of moderate hypertension. It has a long duration of action as it is generally taken once daily and has a broad therapeutic index as patients generally take 10-80mg daily. Carvedilol's action on alpha-1 adrenergic receptors relaxes smooth muscle in vasculature, leading to reduced peripheral vascular resistance and an overall reduction in blood pressure."
998,DB01137,"In oral and intravenous formulations, levofloxacin is indicated in adults for the treatment of various infections caused by susceptible bacteria, including infections of the upper respiratory tract, lower respiratory tract, skin, skin structures, urinary tract, and prostate. The oral formulation is also indicated in both adults and children 6 months of age and older for the post-exposure management of inhalational anthrax caused by _Bacillus anthracis_ and for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of plague caused by _Yersinia pestis_. Levofloxacin, along with other quinolones such as  and , is a member of the third generation of fluoroquinolones, colloquially referred to as the ""respiratory quinolones"" due to improved activity against gram-positive bacteria commonly implicated in respiratory infections. As antimicrobial susceptibility patterns are geographically distinct, local antibiograms should be consulted to ensure adequate coverage of relevant pathogens prior to use.Levofloxacin, like other fluoroquinolone antibiotics, exerts its antimicrobial activity via the inhibition of two key bacterial enzymes: DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Bacterial topoisomerase IV, in addition to contributing to the relaxation of positive supercoils, is essential at the terminal stages of DNA replication and functions to âunlinkâ newly replicated chromosomes to allow for the completion of cell division."

Production for use in humans has been discontinued in the United States. Cefapirin is partly plasma-bound and is effective against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms.Cephapirin is a first-generation cephalosporin that has a wide spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cephapirin is more resistant to beta-lactamases than are the penicillins and so is effective against staphylococci, with the exception of methicillin-resistant staphylococci.The bactericidal activity of cephapirin results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs)."
1001,DB01140,"For the treatment of the following infections (skin, UTI, ENT) caused by; S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, staphylococci, S. pyogenes (group A beta-hemolytic streptococci), E. coli, P. mirabilis, Klebsiella sp, coagulase-negative staphylococci and Streptococcus pyogenes. Long-acting, broad-spectrum, water-soluble, cephalexin derivative. Cefadroxil, a first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic, is used to treat urinary tract infections, skin and skin structure infections, pharyngitis, and tonsillitis. Like all beta-lactam antibiotics, cefadroxil binds to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, causing the inhibition of the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that cefadroxil interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."

Micafungin is an antifungal drug. It belongs to the antifungal class of compounds known as echinocandins and exerts its effect by inhibiting the synthesis of 1,3-beta-D-glucan, an integral component of the fungal cell wall. Formerly known as FK463, micafungin is a semisynthetic lipopeptide synthesized from a fermentation product of Coleophoma empetri that works as an antifungal agent. It is a glucan synthesis inhibitor of the echinocandin structural class."
1003,DB01142,"Oral doxepin is approved for the following indications:    - Treatment of depression and/or anxiety. - Treatment of manic-depressive disorder. However, in 2010 it was approved for the treatment of insomnia. This effect on histamine receptors indicates effectiveness in skin conditions. Breaking its function according to the different effect, doxepin's antidepressive action is primarily associated with the inhibition of the central nervous system biogenic amine reuptake; more specifically, norepinephrine and serotonin at synaptic nerve terminals."
1004,DB01143,"For reduction in the cumulative renal toxicity in patients with ovarian cancer (using cisplatin) and moderate to severe xerostomia in patients undergoing post-operative radiation treatment for head and neck cancer.A phosphorothioate proposed as a radiation-protective agent. It causes splenic vasodilation and may block autonomic ganglia.Amifostine is an organic thiophosphate cytoprotective agent indicated to reduce the cumulative renal toxicity associated with repeated administration of cisplatin in patients with advanced ovarian cancer or non-small cell lung cancer and also to reduce the incidence of moderate to severe xerostomia in patients undergoing post-operative radiation treatment for head and neck cancer. Healthy cells are preferentially protected because amifostine and metabolites are present in healthy cells at 100-fold greater concentrations than in tumour cells.The thiol metabolite is responsible for most of the cytoprotective and radioprotective properties of amifostine. It is readily taken up by cells where it binds to and detoxifies reactive metabolites of platinum and alkylating agents as well as scavenges free radicals. Other possible effects include inhibition of apoptosis, alteration of gene expression and modification of enzyme activity."
1005,DB01144,"For adjunctive treatment of: chronic simple (open-angle) glaucoma, secondary glaucoma, and preoperatively in acute angle-closure glaucoma where delay of surgery is desired in order to lower intraocular pressureA carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that is used in the treatment of glaucoma.Dichlorphenamide is an oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor indicated for adjunctive treatment of: chronic simple (open-angle) glaucoma, secondary glaucoma, and preoperatively in acute angle-closure glaucoma where delay of surgery is desired in order to lower intraocular pressure. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors reduce intraocular pressure by partially suppressing the secretion of aqueous humor (inflow).Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors reduce intraocular pressure by partially suppressing the secretion of aqueous humor (inflow), although the mechanism by which they do this is not fully understood. Evidence suggests that HCO3- ions are produced in the ciliary body by hydration of carbon dioxide under the influence of carbonic anhydrase and diffuse into the posterior chamber which contains more Na+ and HCO3- ions than does plasma and consequently is hypertonic. Water is then attracted to the posterior chamber by osmosis, resulting in a drop in pressure."
1006,DB01146,"Antihistamines used in the treatment of allergy act by competing with histamine for H 1-receptor sites on effector cells. Antihistamines antagonize, in varying degrees, most of the pharmacological effects of histamine, including urticaria and pruritus.Diphenylpyraline is an antihistamine that prevents, but does not reverse, responses mediated by histamine alone. Diphenylpyraline antagonizes most of the pharmacological effects of histamine, including urticaria and pruritus. Also, diphenylpyraline may exhibit anticholinergic actions (as do most of the antihistamines) and may thus provide a drying effect on the nasal mucosa.Antihistamines such as diphenylpyraline used in the treatment of allergy act by competing with histamine for H1-receptor sites on effector cells. This reduces the effects of histamine, leading to a temporary reduction of allergy symptoms."

1008,DB01148,"It may have local anesthetic activity and direct relaxing effects on smooth muscle as well as some activity as a muscarinic antagonist. Flavoxate is a spasmolytic flavone derivative that acts by relaxing the smooth muscle in the urinary tract. Flavoxate is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist indicated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency. Muscarinic receptors play an important role in several major cholin-ergically mediated functions, including contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle and stimulation of salivary secretion.Flavoxate acts as a direct antagonist at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in cholinergically innervated organs. Its anticholinergic-parasympatholytic action reduces the tonus of smooth muscle in the bladder, effectively reducing the number of required voids, urge incontinence episodes, urge severity and improving retention, facilitating increased volume per void."
1009,DB01149,"Its sale was discontinued in 2003 in some countries, due to the small possibility of hepatic (liver) injury. On May 20, 2004, Bristol-Myers Squibb discontinued the sale of Serzone in the United States.Nefazodone, an antidepressant synthetically derived phenylpiperazine, is used to treat major depression. Although it is structurally similar to trazodone, nefazodone has a mechanism of action different from other antidepressants and, hence, lacks the risk for major cardiovascular toxicity seen with tricyclics and insomnia and inhibition of REM sleep seen with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.Within the serotonergic system, nefazodone acts as an antagonist at type 2 serotonin (5-HT2) post-synaptic receptors and, like fluoxetine-type antidepressants, inhibits pre-synaptic serotonin (5-HT) reuptake. Within the noradrenergic system, nefazodone inhibits norepinephrine uptake minimally. Nefazodone also antagonizes alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors, producing sedation, muscle relaxation, and a variety of cardiovascular effects."

1011,DB01151,"In depressed individuals, desipramine exerts a positive effect on mood. The antidepressant effects of TCAs are thought to be due to an overall increase in serotonergic neurotransmission. Desipramine exerts less anticholinergic and sedative side effects compared to tertiary amine TCAs, such as amitriptyline and clomipramine. Patients experiencing more severe depressive episodes may respond quicker than those with mild depressive symptoms.Desipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) that selectively blocks reuptake of norepinephrine (noradrenaline) from the neuronal synapse. Chronic use of desipramine also leads to down-regulation of beta-adrenergic receptors in the cerebral cortex and sensitization of serotonergic receptors."
1012,DB01152,"Used in the topical treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis.Candicidin is an antibiotic obtained from a streptomyces (Streptomyces griseus) and active against some fungi of the genus Candida (C. albicans). Candicidin is administered intravaginally in the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis.Candicidin is a polyene antifungal antibiotic produced by a strain of Streptomyces griseus. It is especially effective against <i>Candida albicans</i> (more effective than amphotericin B), and is administered intravaginally in the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis.Ergosterol, the principal sterol in the fungal cytoplasmic membrane, is the target site of action of Candicidin. Candicidin binds irreversibly to ergosterol, resulting in disruption of membrane integrity and ultimately cell death. There is some evidence that the binding site in the cell wall may be to fatty acids or fatty acid esters and that this binding capacity must be satisfied before candicidin can bring about its lethal effect by binding to sterol in the cell membrane."

When used in combination with  in the marketed product Contraveâ for chronic weight management, the two components are thought to have effects on areas of the brain involved in the regulation of food intake. As norepinephrine has been shown to have anticonvulsant properties, bupropion's inhibitory effects on NET are thought to contribute to its pro-convulsant activity. When used as an aid to smoking cessation, bupropion is thought to confer its anti-craving and anti-withdrawal effects by inhibiting dopamine reuptake, which is thought to be involved in the reward pathways associated with nicotine, and through the antagonism of the nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptor (AChR), thereby blunting the effects of nicotine.

Also used in the treatment of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia, that have failed to respond to adequate doses of a first-line antiarrhythmic agent, such as lidocaine.Bretylium blocks the release of noradrenaline from the peripheral sympathetic nervous system, and is used in emergency medicine, cardiology, and other specialties for the acute management of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. The primary mode of action for bretylium is thought to be inhibition of voltage-gated K(+) channels. Recent evidence has shown that bretylium may also inhibit the Na,K-ATPase by binding to the extracellular K-site.Bretylium is a bromobenzyl quaternary ammonium compound which selectively accumulates in sympathetic ganglia and their postganglionic adrenergic neurons where it inhibits norepinephrine release by depressing adrenergic nerve terminal excitability. Bretylium also suppresses ventricular fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias.Bretylium inhibits norepinephrine release by depressing adrenergic nerve terminal excitability."
1018,DB01159,"For the induction and maintenance of general anesthesiaA nonflammable, halogenated, hydrocarbon anesthetic that provides relatively rapid induction with little or no excitement. nitrous oxide is often given concomitantly. Because halothane may not produce sufficient muscle relaxation, supplemental neuromuscular blocking agents may be required. It does so by decreasing the extent of gap junction mediated cell-cell coupling and altering the activity of the channels that underlie the action potential.Halothane causes general anaethesia due to its actions on multiple ion channels, which ultimately depresses nerve conduction, breathing, cardiac contractility. Its immobilizing effects have been attributed to its binding to potassium channels in cholinergic neurons."

Similar to other local anesthetics, it increases the threshold for electrical excitation in nerves by slowing the propagation of the nerve impulse and reducing the rate of rise of the action potential. Chloroprocaine can be given as an injection, and is available in formulations with and without methylparaben as a preservative. However, at toxic blood concentrations, chloroprocaine may cause atrioventricular block and cardiac arrest, as well as decreased cardiac output and arterial blood pressure. A high concentration of chloroprocaine in plasma can also lead to central nervous system stimulation, depression, or both."
1021,DB01162,"Terazosin blocks adrenaline's action on alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, causing relaxation of smooth muscle in blood vessels and the prostate.Terazosin is a quinazoline derivative alpha-1-selective adrenergic blocker.Terazosin is selective for alpha-1-adrenoceptors but not their individual subtypes. Inhibition of these alpha-1-adrenoceptors results in relaxation of smooth muscle in blood vessels and the prostate, lowering blood pressure and improving urinary flow. It has also been shown that catecholamines induce factors responsible for mitogenesis and alpha-1-adrenergic receptor blockers inhibit this effect. A final long term mechanism of terazosin and other alpha-1-adrenergic receptor blockers is the induction of apoptosis of prostate cells. Treatment with terazosin enhances the expression of transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-beta1), which upregulates p27kip1, and the caspase cascade."

Ofloxacin is bactericidal and its mode of action depends on blocking of bacterial DNA replication by binding itself to an enzyme called DNA gyrase, which allows the untwisting required to replicate one DNA double helix into two. Notably the drug has 100 times higher affinity for bacterial DNA gyrase than for mammalian. Ofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.Ofloxacin acts on DNA gyrase and toposiomerase IV, enzymes which, like human topoisomerase, prevents the excessive supercoiling of DNA during replication or transcription. By inhibiting their function, the drug thereby inhibits normal cell division."

It is marketed under the brand name Pletal by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co.. Cilostazol works by inhibiting both primary and secondary aggregation and reducing calcium-induced contractions.Cilostazol reduces the symptoms of intermittent claudication, as indicated by an increased walking distance. Intermittent claudication is pain in the legs that occurs with walking and disappears with rest. The pain occurs due to reduced blood flow to the legs.Cilostazol and several of its metabolites are cyclic AMP (cAMP) phosphodiesterase III inhibitors (PDE III inhibitors), inhibiting phosphodiesterase activity and suppressing cAMP degradation with a resultant increase in cAMP in platelets and blood vessels, leading to inhibition of platelet aggregation and vasodilation."

In general, arsenic is known to be a naturally toxic substance capable of eliciting a variety of dangerous adverse effects. The enzyme thioredoxin reductase has recently been identified as a target for arsenic trioxide.Arsenic Trioxide is indicated for induction of remission and consolidation in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) who are refractory to, or have relapsed from, retinoid and anthracycline chemotherapy.The mechanism of action of Arsenic Trioxide is not completely understood. Arsenic trioxide causes morphological changes and DNA fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis in NB4 human promyelocytic leukemia cells <i>in vitro</i>."
1028,DB01170,"For the treatment of moderate and severe hypertension, either alone or as an adjunct, and for the treatment of renal hypertension.An antihypertensive agent that acts by inhibiting selectively transmission in post-ganglionic adrenergic nerves. It is believed to act mainly by preventing the release of norepinephrine at nerve endings and causes depletion of norepinephrine in peripheral sympathetic nerve terminals as well as in tissues. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. It is a postganglionic sympathetic nerve terminal blocker that prevents the release of norepinephrine from nerve terminals.Guanethidine acts at the sympathetic neuroeffector junction by inhibiting or interfering with the release and/or distribution of norepinephrine (NE), rather than acting at the effector cell by inhibiting the association of norepinephrine with its receptors. It further reduces blood pressure by decreasing the degree of vasoconstriction that normally results from reflex sympathetic nervous activity upon assumption of the upright posture, thus reducing venous return and cardiac output more."
1029,DB01171,"For the treatment of major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder .A reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) selective for isoform A (RIMA) used to treat major depressive disorder. Most meta-analyses and most studies indicate that in the acute management of depression, moclobemide is more efficacious than placebo medication and similarly efficacious as tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Due to negligible anticholinergic and antihistaminic actions, moclobemide has been better tolerated than tri- or heterocyclic antidepressants . A selective, reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO) which increases the . Besides its presence in sympathetic nerves, there is an abundant evidence that MAO-A is localized in noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus and MAO-B is closely associated with serotonergic neurons of the raphe nucleus .The mechanism of action of moclobemide involves the selective, reversible inhibition of MAO-A."
1030,DB01172,"For treatment of infections where one or more of the following are the known or suspected pathogens: E. coli, Proteus species (both indole-positive and indole-negative), E. aerogenes, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and Acinetobacter species. Kanamycin (also known as kanamycin A) is an aminoglycoside bacteriocidal antibiotic, available in oral, intravenous, and intramuscular forms, and used to treat a wide variety of infections. Aminoglycosides are useful primarily in infections involving aerobic, Gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and Enterobacter. Aminoglycosides like kanamycin âirreversiblyâ bind to specific 30S-subunit proteins and 16S rRNA. This interferes with decoding site in the vicinity of nucleotide 1400 in 16S rRNA of 30S subunit."
1031,DB01173,"Indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomfort associated with acute painful musculo skeletal conditions.A muscarinic antagonist used to treat drug-induced parkinsonism and to relieve pain from muscle spasm.Orphenadrine is indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomfort associated with acute painful musculoskeletal conditions. Orphenadrine is an anticholinergic with a predominantly central effect and only a weak peripheral effect. Parkinson's syndrome is the consequence of a disturbed balance between cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission in the basal ganglia caused by a decrease in dopamine. The effect is somewhat less on bradykinesia.Orphenadrine binds and inhibits both histamine H1 receptors and NMDA receptors. It may have a relaxing effect on skeletal muscle spasms and it has a mood elevating effect."
1032,DB01174,"For the treatment of all types of seizures except absence seizures.A barbituric acid derivative that acts as a nonselective central nervous system depressant. It promotes binding to inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid subtype receptors, and modulates chloride currents through receptor channels. It also inhibits glutamate induced depolarizations.Phenobarbital, the longest-acting barbiturate, is used for its anticonvulsant and sedative-hypnotic properties in the management of all seizure disorders except absence (petit mal).Phenobarbital acts on GABAA receptors, increasing synaptic inhibition. This has the effect of elevating seizure threshold and reducing the spread of seizure activity from a seizure focus. Phenobarbital may also inhibit calcium channels, resulting in a decrease in excitatory transmitter release."
1033,DB01175,"Escitalopram is indicated for the acute and maintenance treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults and pediatric patients 12 years old and older and for the acute treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in adults and pediatric patients 7 years old and older. Amongst SSRIs, escitalopram exerts the highest degree of selectivity for the serotonin transporter (SERT) relative to other off-targets which may explain its lower rates of adverse effects as compared to other agents in this class. Escitalopram also differentiates itself from other SSRIs via allosteric action on its target - this may be the mechanism responsible for its observed superior efficacy and faster onset compared to other SSRIs.Escitalopram belongs to a class of medications called selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Escitalopram may also cause a discontinuation syndrome with abrupt removal of the drug, and should be slowly tapered if discontinuation of therapy is warranted.Escitalopram, like other selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, enhances serotonergic activity by binding to the orthosteric (i.e. primary) binding site on the serotonin transporter (SERT), the same site to which endogenous 5-HT binds, and thus prevents the re-uptake of serotonin into the presynaptic neuron. Escitalopram, along with , is also considered an allosteric serotonin re-uptake inhibitor - it binds to a secondary allosteric site on the SERT molecule to more strongly inhibit 5-HT re-uptake."
1034,DB01176,"Cyclizine is used in the prevention and treatment of nausea, vomiting, and dizziness associated with motion sickness. Additionally, it has been used in the management of vertigo in diseases affecting the vestibular apparatus. The vomiting centre possesses neurons which are rich in muscarinic cholinergic and histamine containing synapses. These types of neurons are especially involved in transmission from the vestibular apparatus to the vomiting centre. Motion sickness principally involves overstimulation of these pathways due to various sensory stimuli."
1035,DB01177,"For the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in adults. The compound has shown activity against breast cancer, lymphomas and leukemias, together with the potential for reduced cardiac toxicity.Idarubicin is an antineoplastic in the anthracycline class. General properties of drugs in this class include: interaction with DNA in a variety of different ways including intercalation (squeezing between the base pairs), DNA strand breakage and inhibition with the enzyme topoisomerase II. Most of these compounds have been isolated from natural sources and antibiotics. However, they lack the specificity of the antimicrobial antibiotics and thus produce significant toxicity."
1036,DB01178,"Used in the management of anxiety and in the treatment of muscle spasm.A non-benzodiazepine that is used in the management of anxiety. It has been suggested for use in the treatment of muscle spasm.Chlormezanone is a non-benzodiazepine muscle relaxant. It was discontinued worldwide in 1996 by its manufacturer due to confirmed serious and rare cutaneous reactions (toxic epidermal necrolysis).Chlormezanone binds to central benzodiazepine receptors which interact allosterically with GABA receptors. This potentiates the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, increasing the inhibition of the ascending reticular activating system and blocking the cortical and limbic arousal that occurs following stimulation of the reticular pathways."
1037,DB01180,"For the treatment of hypertension.Rescinnamine is an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor used as an antihypertensive drug. Rescinnamine inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. By inhibiting angiotensin II, aldosterone reabsorption is decreased as well as vasoconstriction. As angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor and a negative-feedback mediator for renin activity, lower concentrations result in a decrease in blood pressure and stimulation of baroreceptor reflex mechanisms, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion."
1038,DB01181,"Also used as a component of various chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of cervical cancer, as well as in conjunction with surgery and/or radiation therapy in the treatment of various soft tissue sarcomas. small cell lung cancer, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.Ifosfamide is a chemotherapeutic agent chemically related to the nitrogen mustards and a synthetic analog of cyclophosphamide. It is active as an alkylating agent and an immunosuppressive agent.Ifosfamide requires activation by microsomal liver enzymes to active metabolites in order to exert its cytotoxic effects. The stable urinary metabolite, 4-carboxyifosfamide, is formed upon opening of the ring. These urinary metabolites have not been found to be cytotoxic."
1039,DB01182,"It is used in the treatment of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Propafenone has local anesthetic activity approximately equal to procaine.The electrophysiological effect of propafenone manifests itself in a reduction of upstroke velocity (Phase 0) of the monophasic action potential. In Purkinje fibers, and to a lesser extent myocardial fibers, propafenone reduces the fast inward current carried by sodium ions, which is responsible for the drugs antiarrhythmic actions. Diastolic excitability threshold is increased and effective refractory period prolonged. Propafenone reduces spontaneous automaticity and depresses triggered activity."
1040,DB01183,"Naloxone nasal sprays are indicated for the reversal of an opioid overdose or suspected opioid overdose: it is intended for immediate administration as emergency therapy in settings where opioids may be present. Intramuscular or subcutaneous naloxone autoinjectors are used for the emergency treatment of people 12 years of age and older where the use of high-potency opioids such as fentanyl analogues as a chemical weapon, is suspected. However, for individuals using opioid medications or experiencing an overdose, IM injection of naloxone rapidly reverses opioid effects and can cause the injected individual to immediately experience withdrawal symptoms. The primary purpose of including naloxone within Suboxone is to act as a deterrent to injection, as injected naloxone would rapidly reverse the effects of buprenorphine. Naloxone has a shorter duration of action than opioids and multiple doses may be required."
1041,DB01184,"For management of dyspepsia, heartburn, epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting.A specific blocker of dopamine receptors. It speeds gastrointestinal peristalsis, causes prolactin release, and is used as antiemetic and tool in the study of dopaminergic mechanisms.Domperidone is a specific blocker of dopamine receptors. It speeds gastrointestinal peristalsis, causes prolactin release, and is used as antiemetic and tool in the study of dopaminergic mechanisms.Domperidone acts as a gastrointestinal emptying (delayed) adjunct and peristaltic stimulant. Domperidone facilitates gastric emptying and decreases small bowel transit time by increasing esophageal and gastric peristalsis and by lowering esophageal sphincter pressure. Antiemetic: The antiemetic properties of domperidone are related to its dopamine receptor blocking activity at both the chemoreceptor trigger zone and at the gastric level."
1042,DB01185,"In females, for palliation of androgenresponsive recurrent mammary cancer in women who are more than one year but less than five years postmenopausal.An anabolic steroid that has been used in the treatment of male hypogonadism, delayed puberty in males, and in the treatment of breast neoplasms in women.Fluoxymesterone is a synthetic androgen, or male hormone, similar to testosterone. Fluoxymesterone works by attaching itself to androgen receptors; this causes it to interact with the parts of the cell involved in the making of proteins. It may cause an increase in the synthesis of some proteins or a decrease in the synthesis of others. Like testosterone and other androgenic hormones, fluoxymesterone binds to the androgen receptor. It produces retention of nitrogen, sodium, potassium, and phosphorus; increases protein anabolism; decreases amino acid catabolism and decreased urinary excretion of calcium."
1043,DB01186,"It was withdrawn from the US and Canadian markets in 2007 due to an increased risk of cardiac valvulopathy. The dopaminergic D2 receptor subfamily consists of D, D and D subreceptors and has been associated with improvement of symptoms of movement disorders. Thus, agonist activity specific for D2 subfamily receptors, primarily D and D receptor subtypes, are the primary targets of dopaminergic antiparkinsonian agents. Parkinsonian Syndrome manifests when approximately 80% of dopaminergic activity in the nigrostriatal pathway of the brain is lost. In lactotrophs, stimulation of dopamine D receptor causes inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, which decreases intracellular cAMP concentrations and blocks IP3-dependent release of Ca from intracellular stores."
1044,DB01189,"Desflurane is indicated for the induction and maintenance of anesthesia in adults, as well as the maintenance of anesthesia in pediatric patients.Desflurane, or I-653, a a volatile anesthetic that is more rapidly cleared and less metabolized than previous inhaled anesthetics such as , , , or .. It was developed in the late 1980s out of a need for a more rapidly acting and rapidly cleared inhaled anesthetic. Studies of other halogenated inhalational anesthetics have shown that the lipid bilayer spreads out more thinly as the anesthetic incorporates into the bilayer. However, the anesthetic does not bind to lipid heads or acyl chains of hydrocarbons in the bilayer. By incorporating into the lipid bilayer, anesthetics may introduce disorder in the lipids, leading to some indirect effect on ion channels."
1045,DB01190,"In oral and parenteral formulations, clindamycin is indicated for the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria, as well as susceptible staphylococci, streptococci, and pneumococci. Clindamycin is used for antimicrobial prophylaxis against _Viridans_ group streptococcal infections in susceptible patients undergoing oral, dental, or upper respiratory surgery, and may be used for prophylaxis against bacterial endocarditis in penicillin-allergic patients at high risk of these infections.Clindamycin is a semi-synthetic lincosamide antibiotic used in the treatment of a variety of serious infections due to susceptible microorganisms as well as topically for acne vulgaris. Clindamycin is derived from, and has largely replaced, , a naturally occurring lincosamide and the eponymous member of this antibiotic class, due to its improved properties over the parent compound. Because of the associated risks, clindamycin should be reserved for serious infections for which the use of less toxic antimicrobial agents are inappropriate. The mechanism through which topical clindamycin treats acne vulgaris is unclear, but may be related to its activity against _Propionibacterium acnes_, a bacteria that has been associated with acne."
1046,DB01191,"For the management of obesity including weight loss and maintenance of weight loss in patients on a reduced calorie dietDexfenfluramine, also marketed under the name Redux, is a serotoninergic anorectic drug. For a fairly limited time during the middle of the nineties, the US FDA had approved it for use in managing weight loss. However, following multiple concerns about the cardiovascular side-effects of the drug, such approval was withdrawn.Used to treat diabetes and obesity, Dexfenfluramine decreases caloric intake by increasing serotonin levels in the brain&rsquo;s synapses. Dexfenfluramine acts as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. This causes inhbition of serotonin reuptake."
1047,DB01192,"For the treatment of moderate-to-severe pain.An opioid analgesic with actions and uses similar to those of morphine, apart from an absence of cough suppressant activity. It is used in the treatment of moderate to severe pain, including pain in obstetrics. Opioid analgesics exert their principal pharmacologic effects on the CNS and the gastrointestinal tract. The mechanism of respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation.Oxymorphone interacts predominantly with the opioid mu-receptor. These mu-binding sites are discretely distributed in the human brain, with high densities in the posterior amygdala, hypothalamus, thalamus, nucleus caudatus, putamen, and certain cortical areas."
1048,DB01193,"For the management of hypertension and ventricular premature beats in adults.A cardioselective beta-adrenergic antagonist with little effect on the bronchial receptors. The drug has stabilizing and quinidine-like effects on cardiac rhythm as well as weak inherent sympathomimetic action.Acebutolol is a cardioselective, beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agent, which possesses mild intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) in its therapeutically effective dose range. In general, beta-blockers reduce the work the heart has to do and allow it to beat more regularly. Acebutolol has less antagonistic effects on peripheral vascular &szlig;2-receptors at rest and after epinephrine stimulation than nonselective beta-antagonists. Activation of &beta;1-receptors by epinephrine increases the heart rate and the blood pressure, and the heart consumes more oxygen."
1049,DB01194,"Brinzolamide is a highly specific, non-competitive, reversible carbonic anhydrase II (CA-II) inhibitor indicated to reduce ocular pressure in patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma. Although systemic anti-carbonic anhydrase (CA) therapy has been used for almost 50 years with varying degrees of success, systemic administration results in an increase in incidences of adverse effects. Brinzolamide was approved by the FDA in 1998 as a standalone product and in 2013 as a combination product with brimonidine tartrate. Among patients who were naive to IOP therapy (10 patients), the efficacy of brinzolamide was similar to that seen previously in adults, with mean IOP reductions from baseline ranging up to 5 mmHg. Among patients who were on topical IOP-lowering medicinal products (22 patients), mean IOP increased slightly from baseline in the brinzolamide group.Brinzolamide is a highly specific, reversible, non-competitive inhibitor of carbonic anhydrases (CA), the enzymes catalyzing the reversible reaction of water and carbon dioxide (CO2) to form bicarbonate ions."
1050,DB01195,"In New Zealand and America, flecainide is indicated to prevent supraventricular arrhythmias and ventricular arrhythmias. It is used to prevent supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, as well as paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and flutter. Flecainide was granted FDA approval on 31 October 1985.Flecainide inhibits the action of sodium and potassium ion channels in the heart, raising the threshold for depolarization and correcting arrhythmias. This blockade also shortens the duration of action potentials through the Purkinjie fibers. Flecainide also prevents delayed rectifier potassium channels from opening, lengthening the action potential through ventricular and atrial muscle fibers."
1051,DB01196,"Estramustine is a combination of estradiol with nitrogen mustard. In vivo, the nitrogen-mustard moiety becomes active and participates in alkylation of DNA or other cellular components. This causes DNA damage in rapidly dividing cancerous cells leading to cell death and ideally, tumor shrinkage.Estramustine is a derivative of estradiol with a nitrogen mustard moiety. This gives it alkylating properties. In vivo, the nitrogen mustard component is active and can alklyate DNA and other cellular components (such as tubulin components) of rapidly dividing cells."
1052,DB01197,"ATII increases blood pressure using a number of mechanisms. ADH stimulates further water reabsorption from the kidneys via insertion of aquaporin-2 channels on the apical surface of cells of the DCT and collecting tubules. ACE inhibitors inhibit the rapid conversion of ATI to ATII and antagonize RAAS-induced increases in blood pressure. Inhibiting the deactivation of bradykinin increases bradykinin levels and may sustain its effects by causing increased vasodilation and decreased blood pressure.There are two isoforms of ACE: the somatic isoform, which exists as a glycoprotein comprised of a single polypeptide chain of 1277; and the testicular isoform, which has a lower molecular mass and is thought to play a role in sperm maturation and binding of sperm to the oviduct epithelium. Captopril, one of the few ACE inhibitors that is not a prodrug, competes with ATI for binding to ACE and inhibits and enzymatic proteolysis of ATI to ATII."
1053,DB01198,"In addition to zopiclone's benzodiazepine pharmacological properties it also has some barbiturate-like properties.Zopiclone is a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic from the pyrazolopyrimidine class and is indicated for the short-term treatment of insomnia. While Zopiclone is a hypnotic agent with a chemical structure unrelated to benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or other drugs with known hypnotic properties, it interacts with the gamma-aminobutyric acid-benzodiazepine (GABABZ) receptor complex. Subunit modulation of the GABABZ receptor chloride channel macromolecular complex is hypothesized to be responsible for some of the pharmacological properties of benzodiazepines, which include sedative, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, and anticonvulsive effects in animal models. Zopiclone binds selectively to the brain alpha subunit of the GABA A omega-1 receptor.Zopiclone exerts its action by binding on the benzodiazepine receptor complex and modulation of the GABABZ receptor chloride channel macromolecular complex. Both zopiclone and benzodiazepines act indiscriminately at the benzodiazepine binding site on Î±1, Î±2, Î±3 and Î±5 GABAA containing receptors as full agonists causing an enhancement of the inhibitory actions of GABA to produce the therapeutic (hypnotic and anxiolytic) and adverse effects of zopiclone."
1054,DB01200,"It inhibits prolactin secretion and may be used to treat dysfunctions associated with hyperprolactinemia. Bromocriptine is also indicated for the management of signs and symptoms of Parkinsonian Syndrome, as well as the treatment of acromegaly. The dopaminergic D2 receptor subfamily consists of D, D and D subreceptors, which are associated with improvement of symptoms of movement disorders. Thus, agonist activity specific for D2 subfamily receptors, primarily D and D receptor subtypes, are the primary targets of dopaminergic antiparkinsonian agents. In lactotrophs, stimulation of dopamine D receptor causes inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, which decreases intracellular cAMP concentrations and blocks IP3-dependent release of Ca from intracellular stores."
1055,DB01201,"Specifically, it interacts with bacterial RNA polymerase but does not inhibit the mammalian enzyme.Rifapentine is an antibiotic that inhibits DNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity in susceptible cells. It is bactericidal and has a very broad spectrum of activity against most gram-positive and gram-negative organisms (including Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and specifically Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Rifampin is well absorbed when taken orally and is distributed widely in body tissues and fluids, including the CSF. Rifapentine inhibits DNA-dependent RNA polymerase in susceptible strains of M. tuberculosis. Rifapentine acts via the inhibition of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, leading to a suppression of RNA synthesis and cell death."
1056,DB01202,"Levetiracetam is also available as an orally dissolvable tablet that is indicated as an adjunct in the treatment of partial onset seizures in patients with epilepsy who are 4 years of age and older and weigh more than 20kg.Levetiracetam is a drug within the pyrrolidine class that is used to treat various types of seizures stemming from epileptic disorders. It was first approved for use in the United States in 1999 and is structurally and mechanistically unrelated to other anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). Levetiracetam possesses a wide therapeutic index and little-to-no potential to produce, or be subject to, pharmacokinetic interactions - these characteristics make it a desirable choice over other AEDs, a class of drugs notorious for having generally narrow therapeutic indexes and a propensity for involvement in drug interactions.Levetiracetam appears to prevent seizure activity via the selective inhibition of hypersynchronized epileptiform burst firing without affecting normal neuronal transmission, though the exact mechanism through which this occurs is unclear. Anti-epileptic drugs, including levetiracetam, may increase the risk of suicidal ideation or behaviour - patients taking levetiracetam should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and behavioural abnormalities.The exact mechanism through which levetiracetam exerts its anti-epileptic effects is unclear, but is thought to be unique amongst other anti-epileptic medications. SV2A is a membrane-bound protein that is found on synaptic vesicles and is ubiquitous throughout the CNS - it appears to play a role in vesicle exocytosis and in the modulation of synaptic transmission by increasing the available amount of secretory vesicles available for neurotransmission."
1057,DB01203,"Another product formulated with  is indicated to treat hypertension.Nadolol is a nonselective beta adrenal receptor blocker that is used to lower blood pressure. Nadolol was granted FDA approval on 10 December 1979.Nadolol is a nonselective beta adrenal receptor blocker that is used to lower blood pressure. Patients taking nadolol should not aburptly stop taking it as this may lead to exacerbation of ischemic heart disease.Although nadolol is described as a non selective beta blocker, it does not interact with beta 3 adrenal receptors. Antagonism of beta-2 adrenoceptors in the smooth muscle cells of the vasculature inhibits their relaxation, leading to an increase in peripheral vascular resistance and reducing the risk of severe hypotension. Antagonism of beta-2 adrenoceptors in the liver and skeletal muscle inhibits glycogenolysis, in the lungs prevents bronchodilation, and in the pancrease inhibits insulin release."
1058,DB01204,"For the treatment of secondary (chronic) progressive, progressive relapsing, or worsening relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosisAn anthracenedione-derived antineoplastic agent.Mitoxantrone has been shown in vitro to inhibit B cell, T cell, and macrophage proliferation and impair antigen presentation, as well as the secretion of interferon gamma, TNFa, and IL-2.Mitoxantrone, a DNA-reactive agent that intercalates into deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) through hydrogen bonding, causes crosslinks and strand breaks. Mitoxantrone also interferes with ribonucleic acid (RNA) and is a potent inhibitor of topoisomerase II, an enzyme responsible for uncoiling and repairing damaged DNA. It has a cytocidal effect on both proliferating and nonproliferating cultured human cells, suggesting lack of cell cycle phase specificity."
1059,DB01205,"For the complete or partial reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines in cases where general anesthesia has been induced and/or maintained with benzodiazepines, and where sedation has been produced with benzodiazepines for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Also for the management of benzodiazepine overdose as an adjunct for appropriate supportive and symptomatic measures.Fumazenil is an imidazobenzodiazepine derivative and a potent benzodiazepine receptor antagonist that competitively inhibits the activity at the benzodiazepine recognition site on the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex, thereby reversing the effects of benzodiazepine on the central nervous system.Flumazenil antagonizes the CNS effects produced by benzodiazepines, but does not antagonize the central nervous system effects of drugs affecting GABA-ergic neurons by means other than the benzodiazepine receptor (including ethanol, barbiturates, or general anesthetics) and does not reverse the effects of opioids.Flumazenil, an imidazobenzodiazepine derivative, is a benzodiazepine antagonist. It competitively inhibits the benzodiazepine binding site on the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex. Flumazenil is a weak partial agonist in some animal models of activity, but has little or no agonist activity in man."
1060,DB01206,Also used in combination with other agents as secondary therapy for the treatment of refractory or relapsed Hodgkin's disease.An alkylating agent of value against both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.Lomustine is an alkylating agent of the nitrosourea type. Lomustine and its metabolites interferes with the function of DNA and RNA. It is cell cycle&ndash;phase nonspecific. Cancers form when some cells within the body multiply uncontrollably and abnormally. These cells then spread and destroy nearby tissues.
1061,DB01208,"For the treatment of adults with the following infections caused by susceptible strains microorganisms: community-acquired pneumonia (caused by Chlamydia pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, or Streptococcus pneumoniae) and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (caused by Chlamydia pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, or Streptococcus pneumoniae).Sparfloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic indicated for bacterial infections. Sparfloxacin exerts its antibacterial activity by inhibiting DNA gyrase, a bacterial topoisomerase. Sparfloxacin has in vitro activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms. Quinolones may, therefore, be active against bacteria resistant to (beta)-lactam antibiotics. In vitro tests show that the combination of sparfloxacin and rifampin is antagonistic against Staphylococcus aureus.The bactericidal action of sparfloxacin results from inhibition of the enzymes topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV, which are required for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination."
1062,DB01209,"It is similar to morphine with respect to analgesic potency and onset and duration of action. The narcotic antagonist activity is greater than that of pentazocine.Dezocine is a opioid analgesic drug of mixed agonist-antagonist type. It binds with stereospecific receptors at many sites within the central nervous system (CNS) to alter processes affecting both the perception of pain and the emotional response to pain. At least 2 of these types of receptors (mu and kappa) mediate analgesia. Mu receptors are widely distributed throughout the CNS, especially in the limbic system (frontal cortex, temporal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus), thalamus, striatum, hypothalamus, and midbrain as well as laminae I, II, IV, and V of the dorsal horn in the spinal cord."
1063,DB01210,"Levobunolol reduces both elevated and normal IOP in patients with or without glaucoma. As the drug is a nonselective &beta-adrenergic blocking agent, it can produce both systemic pulmonary and cardiovascular effects following topical application to the eye. These effects include adverse pulmonary effects (eg. bronchoconstriction, increased airway resistance), and a decrease in blood pressure and heart rate. Levobunolol's mechanism of action in reducing IOP is not clearly defined, but is believed to be due to a reduction of the production of aqueous humor via blockage of endogenous catecholamine-stimulated increases in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) concentrations within the ciliary processes."
1064,DB01211,"Also for the treatment of pharyngitis and tonsillitis caused by susceptible Streptococcus pyogenes, as well as respiratory tract infections including acute maxillary sinusitis, acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, mild to moderate community-acquired pneuomia, Legionnaires' disease, and pertussis. Other indications include treatment of uncomplicated skin or skin structure infections, helicobacter pylori infection, duodenal ulcer disease, bartonella infections, early Lyme disease, and encephalitis caused by Toxoplasma gondii (in HIV infected patients in conjunction with pyrimethamine). Clarithromycin, a semisynthetic macrolide antibiotic derived from erythromycin, inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the bacterial 50S ribosomal subunit. Clarithromycin may be bacteriostatic or bactericidal depending on the organism and drug concentration.Clarithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic whose spectrum of activity includes many gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, S. pneumoniae, and S. pyogenes) and gram-negative aerobic bacteria (Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis), many anaerobic bacteria, some mycobacteria, and some other organisms including Mycoplasma, Ureaplasma, Chlamydia, Toxoplasma, and Borrelia. Other aerobic bacteria that clarithromycin has activity against include C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae."
1065,DB01212,"Organisms that are generally susceptible to ceftriaxone include S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes (group A beta-hemolytic streptococci), coagulase-negative staphylococci, Some Enterobacter spp, H. influenzae, N. gonorrhoeae, P. mirabilis, E. coli, Klebsiella spp, M. catarrhalis, B. burgdorferi, and some oral anaerobes. Ceftriaxone has broader and stronger gram-negative coverage then first or second-generation cephalosporins, but worse activity against methicillin-susceptible S.aureus. Ceftriaxone is a commonly used antimicrobial due to its good activity against multi-drug resistant Enterobacteriaceae, its relatively safe adverse effect profile, and its long half-life which allows for the convenience of daily or twice-daily dosing.Ceftriaxone is a cephalosporin/cephamycin beta-lactam antibiotic used in the treatment of bacterial infections caused by susceptible, usually gram-positive, organisms. The bactericidal activity of ceftriaxone results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis and is mediated through ceftriaxone binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Ceftriaxone works by inhibiting the mucopeptide synthesis in the bacterial cell wall."
1066,DB01213,"Antizol is indicated as an antidote for ethylene glycol (such as antifreeze) or methanol poisoning, or for use in suspected ethylene glycol or methanol ingestion, either alone or in combination with hemodialysisFomepizole is used as an antidote in confirmed or suspected methanol or ethylene glycol poisoning. Fomepizole is a competitive inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase, the enzyme that catalyzes the initial steps in the metabolism of ethylene glycol and methanol to their toxic metabolites.Fomepizole is a competitive inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase, the enzyme that catalyzes the initial steps in the metabolism of ethylene glycol and methanol to their toxic metabolites. Ethylene glycol is first metabolized to glycoaldehyde which then undergoes further oxidation to glycolate, glyoxylate, and oxalate. Glycolate and oxalate are primarily responsible for metabolic acidosis and renal damage seen in ethylene glycol toxicity. It is formic acid that is primarily responsible for the metabolic acidosis and visual disturbances that are associated with methanol poisoning.Antizol (fomepizole) is a competitive inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase."
1067,DB01214,"It is used as an antiarrhythmic, antihypertensive, and antiglaucoma agent.Metipranolol is a beta1 and beta2 (non-selective) adrenergic receptor-blocking agent that does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct myocardial depressant, or local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) activity. Metipranolol is indicated in the treatment of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of glaucomatous visual field loss and optic nerve damage. It has no significant intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and has only weak local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) and myocardial depressant activity. It appears that the ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agents reduce aqueous humor production, as demonstrated by tonography and fluorophotometry."
1068,DB01215,"For the short-term management of insomnia characterized by difficulty in falling asleep, frequent nocturnal awakenings, and/or early morning awakenings.A benzodiazepine with anticonvulsant, hypnotic, and muscle relaxant properties. It has been shown in some cases to be more potent than diazepam or nitrazepam.Estazolam, a triazolobenzodiazepine derivative, is an oral hypnotic agent with anticonvulsant, hypnotic, and muscle relaxant properties. It has been shown in some cases to be more potent than diazepam or nitrazepam.Benzodiazepines bind nonspecifically to benzodiazepine receptors, which affects affects muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, motor coordination, and memory. As benzodiazepine receptors are thought to be coupled to gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptors, this enhances the effects GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA receptor. Binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA to the site opens the chloride channel, resulting in a hyperpolarized cell membrane that prevents further excitation of the cell."
1069,DB01216,"In the treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia, alpha-blockers such as  and  are also used. Compared to alpha-blockers that focus on providing the rapid relief of symptoms, 5Î±-reductase inhibitors aim to target the underlying disease by blocking the effects of the primary androgen involved in benign prostate hyperplasia and androgenic alopecia, thus reducing the risk for secondary complications while providing symptom control.Finasteride is an antiandrogenic compound that works by suppressing the production of serum and intraprostatic dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in men via inhibiting the enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of DHT. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, finasteride reduced intraprostatic DHT level by 91.4% but finasteride is not expected to decrease the DHT levels to castrate levels since circulating testosterone is also converted to DHT by the type 1 isoenzyme expressed in other tissues. There is evidence from early clinical observations and controlled studies that finasteride may reduce bleeding of prostatic origin.Finasteride acts as a competitive and specific inhibitor of Type II 5Î±-reductase, a nuclear-bound steroid intracellular enzyme primarily located in the prostatic stromal cell that converts the androgen testosterone into the more active metabolite, 5Î±-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). In men with androgenic alopecia, the mechanism of action has not been fully determined, but finasteride has shown to decrease scalp DHT concentration to the levels found in the hairy scalp, reduce serum DHT, increase hair regrowth, and slow hair loss."
1070,DB01217,"Anastrozole is indicated as adjunct therapy in the treatment of hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer in postmenopausal women, and as a first-line treatment for hormone receptor-positive (or hormone receptor-unknown) locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Anastrozole is a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (AI), similar to , used to decrease circulating estrogen levels in the treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogen-responsive breast cancer. Anastrozole has a relatively long duration of action allowing for once daily dosing - serum estradiol is reduced by approximately 70% within 24 hours of beginning therapy with 1mg once daily, and levels remain suppressed for up to 6 days following cessation of therapy. The incidence of ischemic cardiovascular events was increased during anastrozole therapy and patients with pre-existing ischemic heart disease should consider the risks and benefits of anastrozole before beginning therapy. In postmenopausal women, estrogen is primarily derived from the conversion of adrenally-produced androgens into estrogens by the aromatase enzyme - by competitively inhibiting the biosynthesis of estrogen at these enzymes, anastrozole effectively suppresses circulating estrogen levels and, subsequently, the growth of hormone receptor-positive tumours."
1071,DB01218,"For treatment of Severe malariaHalofantrine is an antimalarial. It belongs to the phenanthrene class of compounds that includes quinine and lumefantrine. It appears to inhibit polymerisation of heme molecules (by the parasite enzyme ""heme polymerase""), resulting in the parasite being poisoned by its own waste. Halofantrine has been shown to preferentially block open and inactivated HERG channels leading to some degree of cardiotoxicity.Halofantrine is a synthetic antimalarial which acts as a blood schizonticide. It is effective against multi drug resistant (including mefloquine resistant) P. falciparum malaria.The mechanism of action of Halofantrine may be similar to that of chloroquine, quinine, and mefloquine; by forming toxic complexes with ferritoporphyrin IX that damage the membrane of the parasite."
1072,DB01219,"For use, along with appropriate supportive measures, for the management of the fulminant hypermetabolism of skeletal muscle characteristic of malignant hyperthermia crises in patients of all ages. Also used preoperatively, and sometimes postoperatively, to prevent or attenuate the development of clinical and laboratory signs of malignant hyperthermia in individuals judged to be malignant hyperthermia susceptible.Chemically, dantrolene is a hydantoin derivative, but does not exhibit antiepileptic activity like other hydantoin derivates such as phenytoin.Dantrolene is classified as a direct-acting skeletal muscle relaxant. It is currently the only specific and effective treatment for malignant hyperthermia. In skeletal muscle, Dantrium dissociates excitation-contraction coupling, probably by interfering with the release of Ca2+from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In selected humans, it has been postulated that &ldquo;triggering agents&rdquo; (e.g.,general anesthetics and depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents) produce a change within the cell which results in an elevated myoplasmic calcium."
1073,DB01220,"Rifaximin has multiple indications by the FDA: for the treatment of patients (â¥12 years of age) with traveller's diarrhea caused by noninvasive strains of Escherichia coli; for the reduction of overt hepatic encephalopathy recurrence in patients â¥18 years of age; and in May 2015 it was approved for irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) treatment in adult men and women. Rifaximin is a semisynthetic, rifamycin-based non-systemic antibiotic, meaning that the drug will not pass the gastrointestinal wall into the circulation as is common for other types of orally administered antibiotics. This non-systemic property of the drug is due to the addition of a pyridoimidazole ring, which renders it non-absorbable. Other studies have also shown rifaximin to be an pregnane X receptor (PXR) activator. As PXR is responsible for inhibiting the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-kappa B (NF-ÎºB) and is inhibited in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rifaximin was proven to be effective for the treatment of IBS-D.Rifaximin acts by inhibiting RNA synthesis in susceptible bacteria by binding to the beta-subunit of bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-dependent ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase enzyme."
1074,DB01221,"Ketamine can be used for induction of anesthesia prior other general anesthetic agents and as a supplement of low potency agents. Reports have indicated a potential use of ketamine as a therapeutic tool for the management of depression when administered in lower doses. These reports have increased the interest for ketamine in this area and several clinical trials are launched for this indication.Ketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist with a potent anesthetic effect. It started being used for veterinary purposes in Belgium and in 1964 was proven that compared to PCP, it produced minor hallucinogenic effects and shorter psychotomimetic effects. The anesthetic state produced by Ketamine has been termed as ""dissociative anesthesia"" in that it appears to selectively interrupt association pathways of the brain before producing somesthetic sensory blockade."
1075,DB01222,"In addition, a delayed-release capsule formulation of budesonide is indicated to reduce proteinuria in adults with IgA nephropathy at risk of rapid disease progression. Budesonide is indicated to treat eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE): For this indication, it is only approved for use in adults in Europe  while it is approved for short-term use (12 weeks) in patients 11 years of age and older in the US.Budesonide is a glucocorticoid that is a mix of the 22R and 22S epimer used to treat inflammatory conditions of the lungs and intestines such as asthma, COPD, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. Budesonide was granted FDA approval on 14 February 1994. It is also available in a combination product with .Budesonide is a glucocorticoid used to treat respiratory and digestive conditions by reducing inflammation. It has a wide therapeutic index, as dosing varies highly from patient to patient."
1076,DB01223,"For the treatment of bronchospasm due to asthma, emphysema and chronic bronchitis.Aminophylline is a drug combination that contains theophylline and ethylenediamine in a 2:1 ratio. Once in the body, theophylline is released and acts as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, adenosine receptor blocker, and histone deacetylase activator. The majority of aminophylline medications are discontinued and the remaining medications on the market are in short supply.Aminophylline is the ethylenediamine salt of theophylline. Theophylline stimulates the CNS, skeletal muscles, and cardiac muscle. It relaxes certain smooth muscles in the bronchi, produces diuresis, and causes an increase in gastric secretion.Aminophylline is the ethylenediamine salt of theophylline."
1077,DB01224,"In addition, it may be used for the management of acute manic or mixed episodes in patients with bipolar I disorder, as a monotherapy or combined with other drugs. In addition to the above indications, quetiapine is used in combination with antidepressant drugs for the treatment of major depression. It is well-tolerated and a suitable option for some patients with high sensitivity to other drugs, such as  and .Quetiapine improves the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia and major depression by acting on various neurotransmitter receptors, such as the serotonin and dopamine receptors. In addition, this drug is not indicated for the treatment of psychosis related to dementia due to an increased death rate in elderly patients taking this drug.Although the mechanism of action of quetiapine is not fully understood, several proposed mechanisms exist. In bipolar depression and major depression, quetiapine's actions may be attributed to the binding of this drug or its metabolite to the norepinephrine transporter."
1078,DB01225,"Additionally, enoxaparin is indicated for the inpatient treatment of DVT with or without pulmonary embolism and the treatment of outpatient DVT without pulmonary embolism. Enoxaparin increases Thrombin Time (TT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), preventing and reducing thromboembolic complications such as DVT, pulmonary embolism, and ischemic cardiac complications. Administered at 1.5 mg/kg subcutaneously in a pharmacodynamic study, enoxaparin led to a higher ratio of anti-Factor Xa to anti-Factor IIa activity (mean Â±SD, 14.0Â±3.1) (based on areas under anti-Factor activity versus time curves) when compared to that of heparin (mean Â±SD, 1.22Â±0.13). In pregnant women with prosthetic mechanic heart valves, the risk of thromboembolism is increased. Enoxaparin binds to antithrombin III, a serine protease inhibitor, forming a complex that irreversibly inactivates factor Xa, which is frequently used to monitor anticoagulation in the clinical setting."
1079,DB01226,"For inpatients and outpatients, as an adjunct to general anesthesia, to facilitate tracheal intubation and to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation.Mivacurium is a bisbenzylisoquinolinium based neuromuscular blocker or muscle relaxant. It binds competitively to cholinergic receptors on the motor end-plate to antagonize the action of acetylcholine, resulting in a block of neuromuscular transmission.Mivacurium is a short-acting, nondepolarizing skeletal neuromuscular blocking agent which is hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase. The neuromuscular block produced by mivacurium is readily antagonized by anticholinesterase agents. Because spontaneous recovery after mivacurium is rapid, routine reversal may not always result in a clinical benefit.Mivacurium binds competitively to cholinergic receptors on the motor end-plate to antagonize the action of acetylcholine, resulting in a block of neuromuscular transmission. This action is antagonized by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as neostigmine."
1080,DB01227,"For the treatment and management of opiate dependence. It is sometimes used to treat severe pain in terminal patients.Levacetylmethadol is a narcotic analgesic with a long onset and duration of action. It is used mainly in the treatment of narcotic dependence. Levacetylmethadol was withdrawn from use in the European Union due to its high risk of QT interval prolongation. The production of levacetylmethadol in the US has ceased as well.Levomethadyl acetate (also known as LAAM) is a synthetic synthetic opioid analgesic with multiple actions quantitatively similar to those as morphine, the most prominent of which involve the central nervous system and organs composed of smooth muscle."
1081,DB01228,"Encainide is a class Ic antiarrhythmic agent which was used for management of irregular heartbeats, such as atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. All drug products containing encainide hydrochloride. Encainide hydrochloride, formerly marketed as Enkaid capsules, was associated with increased death rates in patients who had asymptomatic heart rhythm abnormalities after a recent heart attack. The manufacturer of Enkaid capsules voluntarily withdrew the product from the US market on December 16, 1991.Used to treat irregular heartbeats, encainide decreases excitability, conduction velocity, and automaticity as a result of slowed atrial, atrioventricular (AV) nodal, His-Purkinje, and intraventricular conduction. It causes a slight but significant prolongation of refractory periods in these tissues."
1082,DB01229,"It is available as an intravenous solution for injection and the newer formulation contains albumin-bound paclitaxel marketed under the brand name Abraxane.Paclitaxel is a taxoid antineoplastic agent indicated as first-line and subsequent therapy for the treatment of advanced carcinoma of the ovary, and other various cancers including breast cancer. This stability results in the inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic cellular functions. In addition, paclitaxel induces abnormal arrays or ""bundles"" of microtubules throughout the cell cycle and multiple asters of microtubules during mitosis.Paclitaxel interferes with the normal function of microtubule growth. Whereas drugs like colchicine cause the depolymerization of microtubules in vivo, paclitaxel arrests their function by having the opposite effect; it hyper-stabilizes their structure. This destroys the cell's ability to use its cytoskeleton in a flexible manner."
1083,DB01231,"For use in the prevention and symptomatic treatment of peripheral (labyrinthine) vertigo and associated nausea and vomiting that occur in such conditions as Meniere's disease and surgery of the middle and inner ear. Also for the control of nausea and vomiting associated with postoperative states, malignant neoplasms, labyrinthine disturbances, antineoplastic agent therapy, radiation sickness, and infectious diseases.Diphenidol is an antiemetic agent used in the treatment of vomiting and vertigo. It has an antivertigo effect on the vestibular apparatus, inhibiting the chemoreceptor trigger zone to control nausea and vomiting, thus preventing motion sickness.The mechanism by which diphenidol exerts its antiemetic and antivertigo effects is not precisely known. Diphenidol has no significant sedative, tranquilizing, or antihistaminic action. It has a weak peripheral anticholinergic effect."
1084,DB01232,"Like other protease inhibitors, saquinavir has a propensity for participating in drug interactions - use caution when administering saquinavir to patients maintained on other pharmaceutical agents as pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions are common. Careful and regular monitoring of patient bloodwork is recommended, as saquinavir has been associated with the development of metabolic complications (e.g. diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia) and worsening of pre-existing liver disease.The HIV lifecycle is comprised of 3 distinct stages: assembly, involving creation and packaging of essential viral components; budding, wherein the viral particle crosses the host cell plasma membrane and forms a lipid envelope; and maturation, wherein the viral particle alters its structure and becomes infectious. The HIV-1 protease enzyme, a dimeric aspartic protease, is the enzyme responsible for cleaving the Gag polyprotein and thus plays a critical role in many aspects of the HIV viral lifecycle. Its design is based on the ""peptidomimetic"" principle, wherein the molecule contains a hydroxyethylene scaffold that mimics the normal peptide linkage (cleaved by HIV protease) but which itself cannot be cleaved. By preventing HIV-1 protease activity, and thus the proteolysis of the Gag polyprotein, saquinavir results in the production of immature, non-infectious viral particles."
1085,DB01233,"Intravenous metoclopramide facilitates intubation of the small bowel and stimulates gastric emptying and barium flow in patients who require radiological examination of the stomach or small intestine. Metoclopramide is a dopamine antagonist used to treat nausea and vomiting that may be associated with diabetic gastroparesis in addition to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). It is available in the oral tablet form or in solution, and can also be administered through the intravenous route. It also exerts effects on the area postrema of the brain, preventing and relieving the symptoms of nausea and vomiting. Dopamine exerts relaxant effect on the gastrointestinal tract through binding to muscular D2 receptors."
1086,DB01234,"Dexamethasone and  otic suspension is indicated for bacterial infections with inflammation in acute otitis media and acute otitis externa. Intramuscular and intravenous injections are indicated for a number of endocrine, rheumatic, collagen, dermatologic, allergic, ophthalmic, gastrointestinal, respiratory, hematologic, neoplastic, edematous, and other conditions. Dexamethasone was granted FDA approval on 30 October 1958. Corticosteroids have a wide therapeutic window as patients may require doses that are multiples of what the body naturally produces. Lower doses of corticosteroids provide an anti-inflammatory effect, while higher doses are immunosuppressive."
1087,DB01235,"Levodopa on its own is formulated as an oral inhalation powder indicated for intermittent treatment of off episodes in Parkinson's patients who are already being treated with carbidopa and levodopa. Levodopa is most commonly formulated as an oral tablet with a peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor indicated for treatment of Parkinson's disease, post-encephalitic parkinsonism, and symptomatic parkinsonism following carbon monoxide intoxication or manganese intoxication.Levodopa is a prodrug of dopamine that is administered to patients with Parkinson's due to its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Levodopa can be metabolised to dopamine on either side of the blood-brain barrier and so it is generally administered with a dopa decarboxylase inhibitor like carbidopa to prevent metabolism until after it has crossed the blood-brain barrier. Once past the blood-brain barrier, levodopa is metabolized to dopamine and supplements the low endogenous levels of dopamine to treat symptoms of Parkinson's. The first developed drug product that was approved by the FDA was a levodopa and carbidopa combined product called Sinemet that was approved on May 2, 1975.Levodopa is able to cross the blood-brain barrier while dopamine is not."
1088,DB01236,"Sevoflurane is three times more potent than , but has lower potency compared to  and . Unlike other volatile anesthetics, sevoflurane has a pleasant odor and does not irritate the airway. Therefore, it can be used for inhalational induction in adults and children for a wide variety of anesthetic procedures.Sevoflurane induces muscle relaxation and reduces sensitivity by altering tissue excitability with a fast onset of action. It has been suggested that inhaled anesthetics enhance inhibitory postsynaptic channel activity by binding GABA and glycine receptors, and inhibit excitatory synaptic channel activity by binding nicotinic acetylcholine, serotonin, and glutamate receptors. This ability to modulate ion channel activity can also regulate cardiac excitability and contractility."
1089,DB01237,"For management of symptoms related to hay fever and other types of allergy and used to help bring up phlegm, thin secretions, and make a cough productive.Bromodiphenhydramine is an ethanolamine antihistamine with antimicrobial property. Bromodiphenhydramine is used in the control of cutaneous allergies. Ethanolamine antihistamines produce marked sedation in most patients.Bromodiphenhydramine is an antihistamine of the ethanolamine class. Ethanolamine derivatives have greater anticholinergic activity than do other antihistamines, which probably accounts for the antidyskinetic action of Bromodiphenhydramine. This antagonizes the effects of histamine on HA-receptors, leading to a reduction of the negative symptoms brought on by histamine HA-receptor binding."
1090,DB01238,"Aripiprazole is indicated for the treatment of acute manic and mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, irritability associated with autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and Tourette's disorder. It is also used as an adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder. Finally, an extended-release, bimonthly injection formulation of aripiprazole is indicated for the treatment of adult schizophrenia and maintenance therapy for adult bipolar I disorder.Aripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic orally indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar I, major depressive disorder, irritability associated with autism, and Tourette's. Aripiprazole exerts its effects through agonism of dopaminergic and 5-HT1A receptors and antagonism of alpha-adrenergic and 5-HT2A receptors. Aripiprazole has no appreciable affinity for cholinergic muscarinic receptors (IC50>1000 nM).The antipsychotic action of aripiprazole is likely due to its partial agonist activity on D2 and 5-HT1A receptors as well as its antagonist activity at 5-HT2A receptors; however, the exact mechanism has not been fully elucidated."
1091,DB01239,"For treatment of psychotic disorders (e.g. schizophrenia) and of acute mania occuring as part of bipolar disorders.Chlorprothixene is a typical antipsychotic drug of the thioxanthene (tricyclic) class. Chlorprothixene exerts strong blocking effects by blocking the 5-HT2 D1, D2, D3, histamine H1, muscarinic and alpha1 adrenergic receptors.Chlorprothixene is a typical antipsychotic drug of the thioxanthine class. It has a low antipsychotic potency (half to 2/3 of chlorpromazine). Chlorprothixene has not thoroughly demonstrated an antidepressant or analgesic effect but it has demonstrated antiemetic effects. It is used in the treatment of nervous, mental, and emotional conditions."
1092,DB01240,"For the long-term intravenous treatment of primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with the scleroderma spectrum of disease in NYHA Class III and Class IV patients who do not respond adequately to conventional therapy.A prostaglandin that is a powerful vasodilator and inhibits platelet aggregation. It is biosynthesized enzymatically from prostaglandin endoperoxides in human vascular tissue. In animals, the vasodilatory effects reduce right and left ventricular afterload and increase cardiac output and stroke volume. Epoprostenol (PGI2) is a member of the family of prostaglandins that is derived from arachidonic acid. The major pharmacological actions of epoprostenol is ultimately inhibition of platelet aggregation."
1093,DB01241,"Gemfibrozil is indicated to treat patients with Types IV and V hyperlipidemia who have elevated serum triglycerides (usually above 2000mg/dL), elevated VLDL cholesterol, fasting chylomicrons, are at risk of developing pancreatitis, and do not adequately respond to dietary restrictions. Gemfibrozil is also indicated to reduce the risk of developing coronary heart disease in patients with Type IIb hyperlipidemia without history or symptoms of coronary heart disease; who do not adequately respond to weight loss, diet, exercise, and other medications; and have low HDL, raised LDL, and raised triglycerides.Gemfibrozil is a fibric acid agent, similar to , used to treat Type IIb, IV, and V hyperlipidemias. Gemfibrozil is not a first line treatment and is prescribed to patients who have not responded adequately to weight loss, diet, exercise, and other medications. This activation leads to increased HDL, apo AI, apo AII, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), inhibition of apo B synthesis, peripheral lipolysis, decreased removal of free fatty acids by the liver, and increased clearance of apoB. The effects on apoB synthesis and clearance decrease VLDL production which also reduce plasma triglyceride levels."
1094,DB01242,"TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. The antidepressant effects of TCAs are thought to be due to an overall increase in serotonergic neurotransmission. Unlabeled indications include panic disorder, chronic pain (e.g. central pain, idiopathic pain disorder, tension headache, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, neuropathic pain), cataplexy and associated narcolepsy, autistic disorder, trichotillomania, onchophagia, stuttering, premature ejaculation, and premenstrual syndrome. Presynaptic receptors are affected: Î±1 and Î²1 receptors are sensitized, Î±2 receptors are desensitized (leading to increased noradrenaline production). Tricyclics are also known as effective analgesics for different types of pain, especially neuropathic or neuralgic pain.Clomipramine is a strong, but not completely selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI), as the active main metabolite desmethyclomipramine acts preferably as an inhibitor of noradrenaline reuptake."
1095,DB01243,"Used in the treatment of dandruff and mild to moderately severe seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp.Chloroxine is a synthetic antibacterial compound. Chloroxine is a compound used in some shampoos for the treatment of dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp.Chloroxine has an antibacterial action, inhibiting the growth of gram-positive as well as some gram-negative organisms. Also, chloroxine has shown some antifungal activity against certain dermatophytes and yeasts.Although the mechanism of action is not understood, chloroxine may slow down mitotic activity in the epidermis, thereby reducing excessive scaling associated with dandruff or seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp. Chloroxine induces SOS-DNA repair in E. coli, so chloroxine may be genotoxic to bacteria."
1096,DB01244,"For the treatment of hypertension, and chronic stable angina (classic effort-associated angina).A long-acting, non selective, calcium channel blocker with significant anti-anginal activity. The drug produces significant coronary vasodilation and modest peripheral effects. It has antihypertensive and selective anti-arrhythmia activities and acts as a calmodulin antagonist. It is not related chemically to other calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem hydrochloride, nifedipine and verapamil hydrochloride.Bepridil has inhibitory effects on both the slow calcium (L-type) and fast sodium inward currents in myocardial and vascular smooth muscle, interferes with calcium binding to calmodulin, and blocks both voltage and receptor operated calcium channels. This has been demonstrated in isolated myocardial and vascular smooth muscle preparations in which both the slope of the calcium dose response curve and the maximum calcium-induced inotropic response were significantly reduced by bepridil."
1097,DB01245,"For use as a skeletal muscle relaxantDecamethonium is used in anesthesia to cause paralysis. It is similar to acetylcholine and acts as a partial agonist of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.Decamethonium acts as a depolarizing muscle relaxant or neuromuscular blocking agent. It acts as an agonist of nicotinic acetycholine receptors in the motor endplate and causes depolarization. The binding of this acetylcholine to receptors causes the muscle to contract. Since it is not degraded in the neuromuscular junction, the depolarized membrance remains depolarized and unresponsive to any other impulse, causing muscle paralysis."
1098,DB01246,"Used to prevent and relieve allergic conditions which cause pruritus (itching) and urticaria (some allergic skin reactions).A phenothiazine derivative that is used as an antipruritic.Trimeprazine (also known as Alimemazine) is a tricyclic antihistamine, similar in structure to the phenothiazine antipsychotics, but differing in the ring-substitution and chain characteristics. It acts as an anti-histamine, a sedative, and an anti-emetic (anti-nausea). Trimeprazine is used principally as an anti-emetic, to prevent motion sickness or as an anti-histamine in combination with other medications in cough and cold preparations. Tricyclic antihistamines are also structurally-related to the tricyclic antidepressants, explaining the antihistaminergic adverse effects of these two drug classes and also the poor tolerability profile of tricyclic H<sub>1</sub>-antihistamines.Trimeprazine competes with free histamine for binding at HA-receptor sites. This antagonizes the effects of histamine on HA-receptors, leading to a reduction of the negative symptoms brought on by histamine HA-receptor binding."
1099,DB01247,"The patient will present changes in its feelings, thoughts, and ability to handle everyday activities. For a mood disorder to be considered as depression, the symptoms should be present for at least two weeks.Isocarboxazid has the formula 1-benzyl-2-(5-methyl-3-isoxazolylcarbonyl)hydrazine-isocarboxazid. It is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. The reduced MAO activity, caused by isocarboxazid, results in an increased concentration of serotonin, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine in storage sites throughout the central nervous system (CNS) and sympathetic nervous system. The increase of one or more monoamines is the basis for the antidepressant activity of MAO inhibitors like isocarboxazid.Isocarboxazid works by irreversibly blocking the action of monoamine oxidases (MAO) in the nervous system."
1100,DB01248,"Docetaxel is indicated as a single agent for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after chemotherapy failure; and with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide as adjuvant treatment of operable node-positive BC. It is also indicated as a single agent for locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after platinum therapy failure; and with cisplatin for unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic untreated NSCLC. Docetaxel binds to microtubules but does not interact with dimeric tubulin. The resulting microtubule/docetaxel complex does not have the ability to disassemble. This adversely affects cell function because the shortening and lengthening of microtubules (termed dynamic instability) is necessary for their function as a transportation highway for the cell."
1101,DB01249,"Iodixanol is a contrast agent during coronary angiography.Iodixanol is a nonionic hydrophilic compound commonly used as a contrast agent during coronary angiography, particularly in individuals with renal dysfunction, as it is believed to be less toxic to the kidneys than most other intravascular contrast agents.Iodixanol is a contrast agent commonly used during coronary angiography, particularly in individuals with renal dysfunction, as it is believed to be less toxic to the kidneys than most other intravascular contrast agents. It is an imaging contrast agent with the same osmolality as blood (290mOsm/kg H20).Organic iodine compounds attenuate x-rays as they pass through the body, thereby allowing the body structures containing iodine to be delineated in contrast to those structures that do not contain iodine. The degree of opacity produced by these compounds is directly proportional to the total amount (concentration and volume) of the iodinated contrast agent in the path of the x-rays. After intravascular administration, iodixanol makes opaque those internal structures in its path of flow, allowing their visualization until significant hemodilution and elimination occur."
1102,DB01250,"It is also indicated for the long-term maintenance of patients with ulcerative colitis in remission.Olsalazine is an aminosalicylate and a prodrug of  (5-aminosalicylic acid, 5-ASA). Olsalazine is used in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.Olsalazine is an anti-inflammatory agent that blocks the production of cyclooxygenase (COX)-derived products of arachidonic acid metabolism. In about 40% of the patients with ulcerative colitis, administration of olsalazine 1g daily was associated with a decrease in whole gut transit time. The two molecules of mesalamine are released to mediate therapeutic effects. Mesalamine may attenuate inflammation by blocking the COX enzyme and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon."
1103,DB01251,"Used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2.Gliquidone is a sulfonylurea drug used to treat diabetes mellitus type 2. In patients with diabetes mellitus, there is a deficiency or absence of a hormone manufactured by the pancreas called insulin. It also promotes the movement of sugar from the blood into the cells in the body which need it. The mechanism of action of gliquidone in lowering blood glucose appears to be dependent on stimulating the release of insulin from functioning pancreatic beta cells, and increasing sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin. Membrane depolarization stimulates calcium ion influx through voltage-sensitive calcium channels."
1104,DB01253,"Used to treat postpartum haemorrhage and postabortion haemorrhage in patients with uterine atony. An ergot alkaloid with uterine and vascular smooth muscle contractile properties.Ergonovine belongs to the group of medicines known as ergot alkaloids. These medicines are usually given to stop excessive bleeding that sometimes occurs after abortion or a baby is delivered. With usual doses, these contractions precede periods of relaxation; with larger doses, basal uterine tone is elevated and these relaxation periods will be decreased. The sensitivity of the uterus to the oxytocic effect is much greater toward the end of pregnancy."
1105,DB01254,"Dasatinib is also indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients 1 year of age and older with Ph+ CML in chronic phase or newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL in combination with chemotherapy.Dasatinib is an orally available multikinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive leukemias. Also, mutations in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL may lead to relapse during imatinib treatment. It may also cause embryo-fetal toxicity and lead to adverse reactions associated with bone growth and development in pediatric patients.Dasatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with several targets. In patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), the tyrosine kinase activity of BCR-ABL is deregulated, leading to the growth, proliferation and survival of cancerous hematopoietic cells. It has been suggested that dasatinib is able to overcome imatinib resistance caused by BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations because it does not require interaction with some of the residues involved in those mutations."
1106,DB01255,"It is also indicated to treat moderate to severe binge eating disorder (BED) in adults. It was also approved by Health Canada in February 2009. Lisdexamfetamine works to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and binge eating disorder  by blocking dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake and increasing their levels in the extraneuronal space.Once administered, lisdexamfetamine is converted to its active metabolite, dextroamphetamine, which is taken up by the brain.

It works by relaxing muscles in the airways to improve breathing. Arformoterol inhalation is used to prevent bronchoconstriction in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. The use of arformoterol is pending revision due to safety concerns in regards to an increased risk of severe exacerbation of asthma symptoms, leading to hospitalization as well as death in some patients using long-acting beta agonists for the treatment of asthma.Arformoterol, the active (R,R)-enantiomer of formoterol, is a selective long-acting Î²2-adrenergic receptor agonist (beta2-agonist) that has two-fold greater potency than racemic formoterol (which contains both the (S,S) and (R,R)-enantiomers). Increased intracellular cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of the release of proinflammatory mediators from cells, especially from mast cells."
1122,DB01275,"A combination product with isosorbide dinitrate is indicated as an adjunct therapy in the treatment of heart failure.Originally developed in the 1950s as a malaria treatment, hydralazine showed antihypertensive ability and was soon repurposed. Hydralazine has a short duration of action of 2-6h. This drug has a wide therapeutic window, as patients can tolerate doses of up to 300mg. The interference with calcium transport may be by preventing influx of calcium into cells, preventing calcium release from intracellular compartments, directly acting on actin and myosin, or a combination of these actions. This decrease in vascular resistance leads to increased heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output."
1123,DB01276,"Exenatide is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. It activates the GLP-1 receptor and increases insulin secretion, decreases glucagon secretion, and slows gastric emptying to improve glycemic control.

There appears to be at least three distinct receptor complexes that bind with high affinity to amylin."
1126,DB01280,"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoma are relatively rare T-cells malignancy, with only 20 to 25% of patients diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 1.7% of patients diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma having this T-cells variation of the disease. Due to the rarity of these T-cell malignancies, nelarabine was first granted orphan drug status and a fast-track designation by the FDA to address the unmet therapeutic needs of these cancers. Nelarabine is a purine nucleoside analog converted to its corresponding arabinosylguanine nucleotide triphosphate (araGTP), resulting in the inhibition of DNA synthesis and cytotoxicity. Nelarabine preferentially accumulates in T-cells since T-cells have a higher expression of enzymes that convert nelarabine to the active purine analog form, making them effective against T-cells malignancies. Ara-GMP is then monophosphorylated by deoxyguanosine kinase and deoxycytidine kinase to ara-G diphosphate, and then subsequently to the active ara-G triphosphate (ara-GTP)."

It is sold under the trade name Duratocin. It is an analogue of oxytocin, and its action is similar to that of oxytocin; it causes contraction of the uterus.Carbetocin binds to oxytocin receptors present on the smooth musculature of the uterus, resulting in rhythmic contractions of the uterus, increased frequency of existing contractions, and increased uterine tone. The oxytocin receptor content of the uterus is very low in the non-pregnant state, and increases during pregnancy, reaching a peak at the time of delivery."
1129,DB01283,"For the acute and chronic treatment of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee in adults.Lumiracoxib is a COX-2 selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). On August 11, 2007, Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA, the Australian equivalent of the FDA) cancelled the registration of lumiracoxib in Australia due to concerns that it may cause liver failure. New Zealand and Canada have also followed suit in recalling the drug.Lumiracoxib has a different structure from the standard COX-2 inhibitors (e.g. celecoxib). It more closely resembles the structure of diclofenac (one chlorine substituted by fluorine, the phenylacetic acid has another methyl group in meta position), making it a member of the arylalkanoic acid family of NSAIDs. It binds to a different site on the COX-2 receptor than the standard COX-2 inhibitors."
1130,DB01284,"For use as a diagnostic agent in the screening of patients presumed to have adrenocortical insufficiency.Tetracosactide (also known as Cosyntropin) is a synthetic peptide that is identical to the 24-amino acid segment (sequence: SYSMEHFRWGKPVGKKRRPVKVYP) at the N-terminal of adrenocorticotropic hormone. ACTH (1-24), a segment similar in all species, contains the biological activity that stimulates production of corticosteroids in the adrenal cortex. Tetracosactide exhibits the same activity as natural ACTH with regard to all its biological activities. Various studies have shown that the biologic activity of ACTH resides in the N- terminal portion of the molecule and that the 1-20 amino acid residue is the minimal sequence retaining full activity. These are considered to be without physiological or clinical significance.Cosyntropin combines with a specific receptor in the adrenal cell plasma membrane and, in patients with normal adrenocortical function, stimulates the initial reaction involved in the synthesis of adrenal steroids (including cortisol, cortisone, weak androgenic substances, and a limited quantity of aldosterone) from cholesterol by increasing the quantity of the substrate within the mitochondria."

1141,DB01306,"Insulin is released from the pancreas following a meal to promote the uptake of glucose from the blood into internal organs and tissues such as the liver, fat cells, and skeletal muscle. Insulin is an important treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce or synthesize the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels. Insulin aspart is produced in a genetically modified strain of _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ (baker's yeast)    Without an adequate supply of insulin to promote absorption of glucose from the bloodstream, blood sugar levels can climb to dangerously high levels and can result in symptoms such as fatigue, headache, blurred vision, and increased thirst. Insulin aspart is a rapid-acting insulin analogue used to mimic postprandial insulin spikes in diabetic individuals. Substitution of the proline residue at B28 with aspartic acid reduces the tendency to form hexamers and results in a faster rate of absorption and onset of action and shorter duration of action."

Insulin is released from the pancreas following a meal to promote the uptake of glucose from the blood into internal organs and tissues such as the liver, fat cells, and skeletal muscle. Insulin is an important treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce or synthesize the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels. The onset of action of insulin detemir is 1 to 2 hours and its duration of action is up to 24 hours. Interestingly, it has a lower affinity (30%) for the insulin receptor than human insulin.Insulin detemir binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units."
1143,DB01309,"Insulin is typically prescribed for the management of diabetes mellitus to mimic the activity of endogenously produced human insulin, a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas that promotes glucose metabolism. Insulin is an important treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce or synthesize the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels. Without an adequate supply of insulin to promote absorption of glucose from the bloodstream, blood sugar levels can climb to dangerously high levels and can result in symptoms such as fatigue, headache, blurred vision, and increased thirst. Insulin glulisine is a rapid-acting insulin analogue used to mimic postprandial insulin spikes in diabetic individuals. Substitution of the arginine at position B3 for lysine and replacement of the B29 lysine with glutamic acid decreases the propensity to form hexamers, stabilizes the hormone in monomeric form and results in a rapid rate of absorption and short duration of action."
1144,DB01319,"The use of fosamprenavir is pending revision due to a potential association between the drug and myocardial infarction and dyslipidemia in HIV infected adults.Fosamprenavir is a prodrug of amprenavir, an inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease.Fosamprenavir is hydrolyzed by cellular phosphatases to the antiretroviral protease inhibitor amprenavir. This hydrolysis allows for the slow release of amprenavir, reducing the number of pills a patient must take.Fosamprenavir is a prodrug that is rapidly hydrolyzed to amprenavir by cellular phosphatases in the gut epithelium as it is absorbed. Amprenavir is an inhibitor of HIV-1 protease. During HIV replication, HIV protease cleaves viral polypeptide products of the Gag and Gag-Pol genes to form structural proteins of the virion core and essential viral enzymes. Amprenavir interferes with this process by binding to the active site of HIV-1 protease, thereby preventing the processing of viral Gag and Gag-Pol polyprotein precursors, resulting in the formation of immature non-infectious viral particles."
1145,DB01320,"It can also be substituted, short-term, for oral phenytoin in patients aged two years and older when oral phenytoin administration is not possible.Fosphenytoin is a water-soluble phenytoin prodrug used only in hospitals for the treatment of epileptic seizures. It works by slowing down impulses in the brain that cause seizures. Its main mechanism is to block frequency-dependent, use-dependent and voltage-dependent neuronal sodium channels, and therefore limit repetitive firing of action potentials.Fosphenytoin is a water-soluble phenytoin prodrug used for the treatment of epileptic seizures. Withdrawal of fosphenytoin sodium may precipitate seizures and should be done gradually.Fosphenytoin is a prodrug of phenytoin and accordingly, its anticonvulsant effects are attributable to phenytoin. Phenytoin acts on sodium channels on the neuronal cell membrane, limiting the spread of seizure activity and reducing seizure propagation."
1146,DB01324,"(From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p826)As a thiazide diuretic, Polythiazide inhibits the sodium-chloride symporter  which decreases solute reabsorption leading to a retention of water in the urine, as water normally follows solutes. More frequent urination is due to the increased loss of water that has not been retained from the body as a result of a concomitant relationship with sodium loss from the convoluted tubule. The short-term anti-hypertensive action is based on the fact that thiazides decrease preload, decreasing blood pressureAs a diuretic, polythiazide inhibits active chloride reabsorption at the early distal tubule via the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter (TSC), resulting in an increase in the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water. Thiazides like polythiazide also inhibit sodium ion transport across the renal tubular epithelium through binding to the thiazide sensitive sodium-chloride transporter. The antihypertensive mechanism of polythiazide may be mediated through its action on carbonic anhydrases in the smooth muscle or through its action on the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (KCa) channel, also found in the smooth muscle."
1147,DB01325,"Used to treat hypertension.Quinethazone, marketed as Hydromox, is a thiazide diuretic indicated for hypertension. Thiazides also cause loss of potassium and an increase in serum uric acid. Thiazides have been shown to prevent hypertension-related morbidity and mortality although the mechanism is not fully understood. Thiazides cause vasodilation by activating calcium-activated potassium channels (large conductance) in vascular smooth muscles and inhibiting various carbonic anhydrases in vascular tissue.As a diuretic, quinethazone inhibits active chloride reabsorption at the early distal tubule via the Na-Cl cotransporter, resulting in an increase in the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water. Thiazides like quinethazone also inhibit sodium ion transport across the renal tubular epithelium through binding to the thiazide sensitive sodium-chloride transporter."

It is a parenterally administered broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic. It is generally formulated as a formate ester, . It is no longer marketed in the United States.The parenteral prodrug formate ester cefamandole nafate is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic. Cephalosporins have in vitro activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms.Like all beta-lactam antibiotics, cefamandole binds to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, causing the inhibition of the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis."
1149,DB01327,"Mainly used to treat bacterial infections of the skin. It can also be used to treat moderately severe bacterial infections involving the lung, bone, joint, stomach, blood, heart valve, and urinary tract. It is clinically effective against infections caused by staphylococci and streptococci species of Gram positive bacteria. Cefazolin has broad-spectrum antibiotic action due to inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. It attains high serum levels and is excreted quickly via the urine.In vitro tests demonstrate that the bactericidal action of cephalosporins results from inhibition of cell wall synthesis."
1150,DB01328,"For the treatment of bacterial infections caused by susceptible microorganisms.A second-generation cephalosporin administered intravenously or intramuscularly. Its bactericidal action results from inhibition of cell wall synthesis. It is used for urinary tract infections, lower respiratory tract infections, and soft tissue and bone infections.Cefonicid is a second-generation cephalosporin administered intravenously or intramuscularly.

1151,DB01329,"Indicated for the treatment of following infections caused by susceptible bacteria:    1) Respiratory tract infections caused by S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus (penicillinase and non-penicillinase producing strains), S. pyogenes (Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci), P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, E. coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter species. 2) Peritonitis and other intra-abdominal infections caused by E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (including _Bacteroides fragilis). 5) Pelvic Inflammatory Disease, Endometritis, and Other Infections of the Female Genital Tract caused by N. gonorrhoeae, S. epidermidis, S. agalactiae, E. coli, Clostridium spp., Bacteroides species (including Bacteroides fragilis), and anaerobic gram-positive cocci. Although cefoperazone has been shown to be clinically effective in the treatment of infections caused by enterococci in cases of peritonitis and other intra-abdominal infections, infections of the skin and skin structures, pelvic inflammatory disease, endometritis and other infections of the female genital tract, and urinary tract infections, the majority of clinical isolates of enterococci tested are not susceptible to cefoperazone but fall just at or in the intermediate zone of susceptibility, and are moderately resistant to cefoperazone. It is a third-generation antiobiotic agent and it is used in the treatment of various bacterial infections caused by susceptible organisms in the body, including respiratory tract infections, peritonitis, skin infections, endometritis, and bacterial septicemia."

It is derived from cephamycin C, which is produced by Streptomyces lactamdurans.Cefoxitin is a cephamycin antibiotic often grouped with the second-generation cephalosporins. It is active against a broad range of gram-negative bacteria including anaerobes. The methoxy group in the 7a position provides cefoxitin with a high degree of stability in the presence of beta-lactamases, both penicillinases and cephalosporinases, of gram-negative bacteria.The bactericidal action of cefoxitin results from inhibition of cell wall synthesis."
1154,DB01332,"Cetizoxime was previously indicated for the treatment of infections due to susceptible strains of bacteria.A semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic which can be administered intravenously or by suppository. The drug is highly resistant to a broad spectrum of beta-lactamases and is active against a wide range of both aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative organisms.

By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, it inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis."
1155,DB01336,"Metocurine is a muscle relaxant.Dimethyltubocurarinium (INN) or metocurine (USAN), also known as dimethyltubocurarine, is a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant. Patients on chronic anticonvulsant drugs are relatively resistant to metocurine. Metocurine antagonizes the neurotransmitter action of acetylcholine by binding competitively with cholinergic receptor sites on the motor end-plate. This antagonism is inhibited, and neuromuscular block reversed, by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as neostigmine, edrophonium, and pyridostigmine."
1156,DB01337,"Used as a muscle relaxant during anesthesia and surgical procedures.A bis-quaternary steroid that is a competitive nicotinic antagonist. It acts as a competitive acetylcholine antagonist on neuromuscular junctions, displacing acetylcholine (hence competitive) from its post-synaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. It is, unlike suxamethonium, a non-depolarising agent, which means, that it causes no spontaneous depolarisations upon association with the nicotinic receptor in neuromuscular junction, thus producing no muscle fasciculations upon administration. Pancuronium has no hormonal activity. It exerts slight vagolytic activity (i.e. diminishing activity of the vagus nerve) and no ganglioplegic (i.e., blocking ganglions) activity.Nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents inhibit neuromuscular transmission by competing with acetylcholine for the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate, thereby reducing the response of the end plate to acetylcholine."
1157,DB01338,"Used as a muscle relaxant during anesthesia and surgical procedures.Pipecuronium is a piperazinyl androstane derivative which is a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent.Pipecuronium is a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent. Neuromuscular blocking agents produce skeletal muscle paralysis by blocking neural transmission at the myoneural junction. The paralysis is selective initially and usually appears in the following muscles consecutively: levator muscles of eyelids, muscles of mastication, limb muscles, abdominal muscles, muscles of the glottis, and finally, the intercostal muscles and the diaphragm. Neuromuscular blocking agents have no clinically significant effect on consciousness or the pain threshold. Nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents inhibit neuromuscular transmission by competing with acetylcholine for the cholinergic receptors of the motor end plate, thereby reducing the response of the end plate to acetylcholine."
1158,DB01339,"Vecuronium is a muscle relaxing agent and is used as an adjunct in general anesthesia.Monoquaternary homolog of pancuronium. A non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent with shorter duration of action than pancuronium. Vecuronium is a bisquaternary nitrogen compound that acts by competitively binding to nicotinic cholinergic receptors. The binding of vecuronium decreases the opportunity for acetylcholine to bind to the nicotinic receptor at the postjunctional membrane of the myoneural junction. As a result, depolarization is prevented, calcium ions are not released and muscle contraction does not occur."
1159,DB01340,"It belongs to the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) class of drugs. (The absolute bioavailability of cilazaprilat after oral administration of cilazaprilat is 19%.) Ingestion of food immediately before the administration of cilazapril reduces the average peak plasma concentration of cilazaprilat by 29%, delays the peak by one hour and reduces the bioavailability of cilazaprilat by 14%. It competes with angiotensin I for binding at the angiotensin-converting enzyme, blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. As angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor and a negative feedback mediator for renin activity, lower angiotensin II levels results in a decrease in blood pressure, an increase in renin activity, and stimulation of baroreceptor reflex mechanisms."
1160,DB01344,"Used to treat abnormally high potassium levels.Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is a medication used to treat abnormally high potassium levels. It may be taken orally or by rectum, as an enema, and functions as a potassium-binding resin in the intestines. Polystyrene sulfonate is used to treat high levels of potassium in the blood, also called hyperkalemia. The indigestible potassium polystryene sulfonate complex is excreted with the faeces, preventing the absorption of potassium into the blood stream. Hence, the serum potassium level decreases."
1161,DB01345,"Potassium is used to regulate hypokalemia as a primary condition or secondary to other medical conditions. The balance between potassium and sodium is maintained by ion pumps in the cell membrane. The ability of cells to produce electrical discharge is critical for body functions such as neurotransmission, muscle contraction, and heart function. Potassium is also an essential mineral needed to regulate water balance, blood pressure and levels of acidity.Potassium is the major cation (positive ion) inside animal cells, while sodium is the major cation outside animal cells. The balance between potassium and sodium is maintained by ion pumps in the cell membrane."
1162,DB01348,"Spirapril is an ACE inhibitor class drug used to treat hypertension.Spirapril is an ACE inhibitor antihypertensive drug used to treat hypertension. ACE inhibitors are used primarily in treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure.Spirapril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. By blocking ACE, spirapril decreases angiotensin II which is a vasoconstrictor and inducer of aldosterone. Combined, this leades to a decrease in blood pressure.Spiraprilat, the active metabolite of spirapril, competes with angiotensin I for binding at the angiotensin-converting enzyme, blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. As angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor and a negative-feedback mediator for renin activity, lower concentrations result in a decrease in blood pressure and stimulation of baroreceptor reflex mechanisms, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion."
1163,DB01353,"It is thought to act on receptors in the brain (GABA receptors) causing the release of the chemical GABA. Butethal binds at a distinct binding site associated with a Cl  ionopore at the GABAA receptor, increasing the duration of time for which the Cl  ionopore is open. All of these effects are associated with marked decreases in GABA-sensitive neuronal calcium conductance (gCa). The net result of barbiturate action is acute potentiation of inhibitory GABAergic tone. Barbiturates also act through potent (if less well characterized) and direct inhibition of excitatory AMPA-type glutamate receptors, resulting in a profound suppression of glutamatergic neurotransmission."
1164,DB01357,"It is used as the estrogen component of many combination ORAL contraceptives.Mestranol is the 3-methyl ether of ethinylestradiol. It binds to (and activates) the estrogen receptor. Mestranol is a biologically inactive prodrug of ethinylestradiol to which it is demethylated in the liver with a conversion efficiency of 70%. Estrogens diffuse into their target cells and interact with a protein receptor. Estrogens increase the hepatic synthesis of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), thyroid-binding globulin (TBG), and other serum proteins and suppress follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary."
1165,DB01359,"Penbutolol is contraindicated in patients with cardiogenic shock, sinus bradycardia, second and third degree atrioventricular conduction block, bronchial asthma, and those with known hypersensitivity.Penbutolol is a drug in the beta-blocker class used to treat hypertension. Penbutolol binds both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors, rendering it a non-selective beta-blocker. Penbutolol is contraindicated in patients with cardiogenic shock, sinus bradycardia, second and third degree atrioventricular conduction block, bronchial asthma, and those with known hypersensitivity.Penbutolol is a Ã-1, Ã-2 (nonselective) adrenergic receptor antagonist. In human studies, however, heart rate decreases have been similar to those seen with propranolol.Penbutolol acts on the Î²1 adrenergic receptors in both the heart and the kidney. The increase in cAMP leads to activation of protein kinase A (PKA), which alters the movement of calcium ions in heart muscle and increases the heart rate."
1166,DB01362,"Iohexol ia used in myelography, arthrography, nephroangiography, arteriography, and other radiographic procedures.Iohexol is an effective non-ionic, water-soluble contrast agent which is used in myelography, arthrography, nephroangiography, arteriography, and other radiographic procedures. Its low systemic toxicity is the combined result of low chemotoxicity and low osmolality.Iohexol is an effective non-ionic, water-soluble contrast agent which is used in myelography, arthrography, nephroangiography, arteriography, and other radiographic procedures. The degree of opacity produced by these compounds is directly proportional to the total amount (concentration and volume) of the iodinated contrast agent in the path of the x-rays. After intrathecal administration into the subarachnoid space, diffusion of iohexol in the CSF allows the visualization of the subarachnoid spaces of the head and spinal canal. After intravascular administration, iohexol makes opaque those vessels in its path of flow, allowing visualization of the internal structures until significant hemodilution occurs."
1167,DB01364,"It is an alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor agonist; however, it also causes the indirect release of norepinephrine from sympathetic neurons, inhibiting norepinephrine reuptake and displacing more norepinephrine from storage vesicles. Also, the use of ephedrine for hypotension prophylaxis is associated with a higher risk of hypertension, compared to when ephedrine is used to treat hypotension.Ephedrine is a direct and indirect sympathomimetic amine. As a direct effect, ephedrine activates alpha-adrenergic and beta-adrenergic receptors. Ephedrine acts as an agonist of alpha-1, beta-1 and beta-2-adrenergic receptors. The stimulation of alpha-1-adrenergic receptors causes the constriction of veins and a rise in blood pressure, the stimulation of beta-1-adrenergic receptors increases cardiac chronotropy and inotropy, and the stimulation of beta-2-adrenergic receptors causes vasodilation and bronchodilation."
1168,DB01365,"Used to maintain blood pressure in hypotensive states.A sympathomimetic agent with mainly indirect effects on adrenergic receptors. Although the central stimulant effects of mephentermine are much less than those of amphetamine, its use may lead to amphetamine-type dependence. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p1248)Mephentermine is a sympathomimetic agent with mainly indirect effects on adrenergic receptors. Although the central stimulant effects of mephentermine are much less than those of amphetamine, its use may lead to amphetamine-type dependence. Cardiac output and systolic and diastolic pressures are usually increased."

It is a potent bronchodilator that may be administered orally or by aerosol inhalation.Procaterol is a long-acting beta-2-adrenergic receptor agonist. It is a potent bronchodilator that may be administered orally or by aerosol inhalation.Beta(2)-receptor stimulation in the lung causes relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle, bronchodilation, and increased bronchial airflow."
1170,DB01367,"MAO-A is found predominantly in the GI tract and liver, and regulates the metabolic degradation of circulating catecholamines and dietary amines. MAO-B is the major form in the human brain and is responsible for the regulation of the metabolic degradation of dopamine and phenylethylamine. In ex vivo animal studies in brain, liver and intestinal tissues rasagiline was shown to be a potent,selective, and irreversible monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) inhibitor. One mechanism is believed to be related to its MAO-B inhibitory activity, which causes an increase in extracellular levels of dopamine in the striatum. The elevated dopamine level and subsequent increased dopaminergic activity are likely to mediate rasagiline's beneficial effects seen in models of dopaminergic motor dysfunction."
1171,DB01369,"For the treatment of bacterial infections (usually in combination with dalfopristin).Quinupristin/dalfopristin is a combination of two antibiotics used to treat infections by staphylococci and by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. Dalfopristin inhibits the early phase of protein synthesis in the bacterial ribosome and quinupristin inhibits the late phase of protein synthesis. The combination of the two components acts synergistically and is more effective in vitro than each component alone.Quinupristin is a streptogramin antibiotic, derived from pristinamycin I. By inhibiting the bacterial ribosomal subunits, protein synthesis is inhibited thus leading to eventual bacterial cell death or stasis.Quinupristin inhibits the late phase of protein synthesis in the bacterial ribosome. Dalfopristin binds to the 23S portion of the 50S ribosomal subunit, and changes the conformation it, enhancing the binding of quinupristin by a factor of about 100."
1172,DB01377,"Indicated for over-the-counter use as a supplement for cardiovascular and neuromuscular health, and as an antacid for relief of acid indigestion and upset stomach. Magnesium oxide, in combination with sodium picosulfate and anhydrous citric acid, is indicated for cleansing of the colon as a preparation for colonoscopy in adults and pediatric patients ages 9 years and older.Magnesium oxide is an inorganic compound that occurs in nature as the mineral periclase. In aqueous media combines quickly with water to form magnesium hydroxide. It is used as an antacid and mild laxative and has many nonmedicinal uses.The term ""Milk of Magnesia"" was first used to describe a white aqueous, mildly alkaline suspension of magnesium hydroxide formulated at about 8%w/v. Milk of magnesia is primarily used to alleviate constipation, but can also be used to relieve indigestion and heartburn."
1173,DB01380,"Cortisone acetate is indicated to treat a wide variety of endocrine, rheumatic, collagen, dermatologic, allergic, ophthalmic, respiratory, hematologic, neoplastic, edematous, and gastrointestinal diseases and disorders.Cortisone acetate was first isolate in 1935 and became more widely researched in 1949. Since then, glucocorticoids such as cortisone acetate have been used to treat a number of inflammatory conditions such as endocrine, rheumatic, collagen, dermatologic, allergic, ophthalmic, respiratory, hematologic, neoplastic, edematous, and gastrointestinal diseases and disorders. Cortisone acetate was granted FDA approval on 13 June 1950.Corticosteroids bind to the glucocorticoid receptor, inhibiting pro-inflammatory signals, and promoting anti-inflammatory signals. The duration of action is moderate as it is generally given once daily. Lower doses of corticosteroids provide an anti-inflammatory effect, while higher doses are immunosuppressive."
1174,DB01381,"However, other studies did not support its clinical benefit for patients with cognitive impairment and dementia. Numerous meta-analysis studies showed insufficient evidence of the effectiveness of EGb in reducing both all-cause dementia incidence and Alzheimer's disease-associated dementia incidence in elderly patients with normal cognition or with mild cognitive impairment. Overall, there is a lack of strong evidence in the use of EGb for the treatment or prevention of cardiovascular diseases. In a small trial, the use of EGb as an adjunctive treatment with citalopram improved depressive symptoms and cognitive function in patients with depression. One study showed that bilobalide, a terpene lactone, delays the onset of hypoxic glycolysis."
1175,DB01382,"Glycodiazine is used with diet to lower blood glucose by increasing the secretion of insulin from pancreas and increasing the sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin. Glycodiazine likely binds to ATP-sensitive potassium channel receptors on the pancreatic cell surface, reducing potassium conductance and causing depolarization of the membrane. This increase in intracellular calcium ion concentration induces the secretion of insulin. It is used for the concomitant use with insulin for the treatment of noninsulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus.Glycodiazine is used with diet to lower blood glucose by increasing the secretion of insulin from pancreas and increasing the sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin.The mechanism of action of glycodiazine in lowering blood glucose appears to be dependent on stimulating the release of insulin from functioning pancreatic beta cells, and increasing sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin. Glycodiazine likely binds to ATP-sensitive potassium channel receptors on the pancreatic cell surface, reducing potassium conductance and causing depolarization of the membrane."
1176,DB01390,"Sodium bicarbonate is used for the treatment of metabolic acidosis which may occur in severe renal disease, uncontrolled diabetes, circulatory insufficiency due to shock or severe dehydration, extracorporeal circulation of blood, cardiac arrest and severe primary lactic acidosis. Further indicated in the treatment of certain drug intoxications, including barbiturates (where dissociation of the barbiturateprotein complex is desired), in poisoning by salicylates or methyl alcohol and in hemolytic reactions requiring alkalinization of the urine to diminish nephrotoxicity of blood pigments.Sodium bicarbonate is a white, crystalline powder that is commonly used as a pH buffering agent, an electrolyte replenisher, systemic alkalizer and in topical cleansing solutions.Intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy increases plasma bicarbonate, buffers excess hydrogen ion concentration, raises blood pH and reverses the clinical manifestations of acidosis.Sodium bicarbonate is a systemic alkalizer, which increases plasma bicarbonate, buffers excess hydrogen ion concentration, and raises blood pH, thereby reversing the clinical manifestations of acidosis. By maintaining an alkaline urine, the actual dissolution of uric acid stones may be accomplished. Sodium bicarbonate acts as an antacid and reacts chemically to neutralize or buffer existing quantities of stomach acid but has no direct effect on its output. This action results in increased pH value of stomach contents, thus providing relief of hyperacidity symptoms."
1177,DB01392,"Yohimbine has been used as a mydriatic and in the treatment of impotence. It is also alleged to be an aphrodisiac.Yohimbine is an indolalkylamine alkaloid with chemical similarity to reserpine. Yohimbine's peripheral autonomic nervous system effect is to increase parasympathetic (cholinergic) and decrease sympathetic (adrenergic) activity. Its effect on blood pressure, if any, would be to lower it; however, no adequate studies are at hand to quantitate this effect in terms of Yohimbine dosage.Yohimbine is a pre-synaptic alpha 2-adrenergic blocking agent. However, yohimbine may exert its beneficial effect on erectile ability through blockade of central alpha 2-adrenergic receptors producing an increase in sympathetic drive secondary to an increase in norepinephrine release and in firing rate of cells in the brain noradrenergic nuclei."
1178,DB01393,"Also for the treatment of secondary hyperlipidaemias, e.g. severe hypertriglyceridemias, when sufficient improvement does not occur after correction of the underlying disorder (e.g. diabetes mellitus).Antilipemic agent that lowers cholesterol and triglycerides. It decreases low density lipoproteins and increases high density lipoproteins.Bezafibrate is an antilipemic agent that lowers cholesterol and triglycerides. Bezafibrate lowers elevated blood lipids (triglycerides and cholesterol). This may lead, amongst other things, to a reduction in both blood and plasma viscosity. A reduction in blood glucose concentration due to an increase in glucose tolerance has been reported in diabetic patients."
1179,DB01394,"Colchicine is indicated for the prophylaxis and treatment of gout flares. Some off-label uses of colchicine include the treatment of the manifestations of Behcet's syndrome, pericarditis, and postpericardiotomy syndrome.Colchicine is an alkaloid drug derived from a plant belonging to the Lily family, known as _Colchicum autumnale_, or ""autumn crocus."" Colchicine is used in the treatment of gout flares and Familial Mediterranean fever, and prevention of major cardiovascular events. It has also been investigated in other inflammatory and fibrotic conditions.Colchicine ameliorates the symptoms of gout and Familial Mediterranean fever. Colchicine has a narrow therapeutic window.The exact mechanism of action of colchicine has not been fully established; however, colchicine likely interferes with the intracellular assembly of the inflammasome complex present in neutrophils and monocytes that mediates activation of interleukin-1Î², an inflammatory mediator."
1180,DB01395,"L7973,L33174] In addition to its use for contraceptive effects, this combination is used to treat moderate acne vulgaris and the symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Drospirenone combined with estrogen may also may aid in the prevention of osteoporosis in women who have been post-menopausal for at least a year and are not candidates for other therapies. When used for the treatment of acne vulgaris, drospirenone-containing contraceptives should only be used in women â¥14 years of age who have experienced menarche, desire oral contraception, and do not have any contraindications to oral contraceptives. In 2012, however, a safety statement by the FDA concluded that the increase in the risk of thromboembolism resulting from the use of drospirenone remains unclear, as studies regarding this risk are conflicting. **A note on venous thromboembolism risk and antimineralcorticoid effects**    As with other oral contraceptives, the risk of venous thromboembolism and cardiovascular events may be increased when drospirenone is taken."
1181,DB01396,"For the treatment and management of congestive cardiac insufficiency, arrhythmias and heart failure.A cardiac glycoside sometimes used in place of digoxin. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p665)Digitoxin is a cardiac glycoside sometimes used in place of DIGOXIN. It has a longer half-life than digoxin; toxic effects, which are similar to those of digoxin, are longer lasting (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p665). Digitoxin lacks the strength of evidence that digoxin has in the management of heart failure.Digitoxin inhibits the Na-K-ATPase membrane pump, resulting in an increase in intracellular sodium and calcium concentrations. Digitoxin also acts on the electrical activity of the heart, increasing the slope of phase 4 depolarization, shortening the action potential duration, and decreasing the maximal diastolic potential."
1182,DB01399,"The parent compound has an elimination half-life of about 1 hour. Salicylic acid (the active metabolite) biotransformation is saturated at anti-inflammatory doses of salsalate. Such capacity limited biotransformation results in an increase in the half-life of salicylic acid from 3.5 to 16 or more hours.Salsalate is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent for oral administration. In contrast to aspirin, salsalate causes no greater fecal gastrointestinal blood loss than placebo.The mode of anti-inflammatory action of salsalate and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is not fully defined, but appears to be primarily associated with inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. Although salicylic acid (the primary metabolite of salsalate) is a weak inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro, salsalate appears to selectively inhibit prostaglandin synthesis in vivo, providing anti-inflammatory activity equivalent to aspirin and indomethacin."
1183,DB01400,"Neostigmine is used for the symptomatic treatment of myasthenia gravis by improving muscle tone.A cholinesterase inhibitor used in the treatment of myasthenia gravis and to reverse the effects of muscle relaxants such as gallamine and tubocurarine. Neostigmine, unlike physostigmine, does not cross the blood-brain barrier.Neostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor used in the treatment of myasthenia gravis and to reverse the effects of muscle relaxants such as gallamine and tubocurarine. Neostigmine, unlike physostigmine, does not cross the blood-brain barrier. By inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, more acetylcholine is available in the synapse, therefore, more of it can bind to the fewer receptors present in myasthenia gravis and can better trigger muscular contraction. So, with acetylcholinesterase inhibited, more acetylcholine is present By interfering with the breakdown of acetylcholine, neostigmine indirectly stimulates both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors which are involved in muscle contraction.."
1184,DB01401,"Choline magnesium trisalicylate is used to reduce pain and inflammation caused by conditions such as arthritis. This medication is also used to treat fever in adults.Choline magnesium trisalicylate is a non-acetylated salicylate used widely as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug.

1185,DB01403,"It has the histamine-antagonist properties of the antihistamines together with central nervous system effects resembling those of chlorpromazine. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p604)Methotrimeprazine is a phenothiazine with pharmacological activity similar to that of both chlorpromazine and promethazine. It has the histamine-antagonist properties of the antihistamines together with central nervous system effects resembling those of chlorpromazine. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p604)Methotrimeprazine's antipsychotic effect is largely due to its antagonism of dopamine receptors in the brain. In addition, its binding to 5HT2 receptors may also play a role."
1186,DB01406,"For the treatment of endometriosis and fibrocystic breast disease (in patients unresponsive to simple measures). Also used for the prophylactic treatment of all types of hereditary angioedema in males and females.A synthetic steroid with antigonadotropic and anti-estrogenic activities that acts as an anterior pituitary suppressant by inhibiting the pituitary output of gonadotropins. Danazol has been used in the treatment of endometriosis and some benign breast disorders.Danazol is a derivative of the synthetic steroid ethisterone, a modified testosterone. It possesses some androgenic properties.As a gonadotropin inhibitor, danazol suppresses the pituitary-ovarian axis possibly by inhibiting the output of pituitary gonadotropins. In fibrocystic breast disease, the exact mechanism of action of danazol is unknown, but may be related to suppressed estrogenic stimulation as a result of decreased ovarian production of estrogen."

Tiotropium acts mainly on M3 muscarinic receptors located in the airways to produce smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilation."
1189,DB01410,"For the treatment of nasal symptoms associated with seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older.Ciclesonide is a glucocorticoid used to treat obstructive airway diseases. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of effects on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in allergic inflammation.Glucocorticoids such as ciclesonide can inhibit leukocyte infiltration at the site of inflammation, interfere with mediators of inflammatory response, and suppress humoral immune responses. Ciclesonide reduces inflammatory reaction by limiting the capillary dilatation and permeability of the vascular structures. These compounds restrict the accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages and reduce the release of vasoactive kinins. Ciclesonide is a glucocorticoid receptor agonist."
1190,DB01413,"Cefepime is also used in combination with  to treat cUTI.Cefepime is a fourth-generation cephalosporin antibiotic developed in 1994. Cefepime is active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and has greater activity against both compared to third-generation antibiotics. Cefepime is normally used to treat severe nosocomial pneumonia and infections caused by multi-resistant microorganisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and is also indicated for the empirical treatment of febrile neutropenia. The popularity of its third-generation predecessors, its clinical efficacy, and the high prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria might be some of the factors leading to an increase in the use of cefepime. In animal models of infection, the time that the unbound plasma concentration of cefepime exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of infecting organisms has been shown to correlate with treatment efficacy."
1191,DB01415,"Indicated for the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (ABECB), acute bacterial otitis media, pharyngitis, and tonsilitis.Ceftibuten is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic that is orally-administered. It is typically used to treat acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (ABECB), acute bacterial otitis media, pharyngitis, and tonsilitis.Ceftibuten is an antibiotic with bactericidal actions. Ceftibuten exerts its bactericidal action by binding to essential target proteins of the bacterial cell wall. This binding leads to inhibition of cell-wall synthesis."
1192,DB01416,"Commonly used to treat acute otitis media, pharyngitis, and sinusitis, cefpodoxime proxetil is a prodrug which is absorbed and de-esterified by the intestinal mucosa to Cefpodoxime.Cefpodoxime is shown to be effective against most Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, except Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus, and Bacteroides fragilis.Cefpodoxime is active against a wide spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Cefpodoxime is stable in the presence of beta-lactamase enzymes. Cefpodoxime is inactivated by certain extended spectrum beta-lactamases. The bactericidal activity of cefpodoxime results from its inhibition of cell wall synthesis. The active metabolite of cefpodoxime binds preferentially to penicillin binding protein 3, which inhibits production of peptidoglycan, the primary constituent of bacterial cell walls."
1193,DB01418,"This prevents carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, II, VII, IX and X, and interferes with coagulation. This prevents carboxylation of certain glutamic acid residues near the N-terminals of clotting factors II, VII, IX and X, the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. Glutamic acid carboxylation is important for the interaction between these clotting factors and calcium. Both the extrinsic (via factors VII, X and II) and intrinsic (via factors IX, X and II) are affected by acenocoumarol.Acenocoumarol inhibits vitamin K reductase, resulting in depletion of the reduced form of vitamin K (vitamin KH2). As vitamin K is a cofactor for the carboxylation of glutamate residues on the N-terminal regions of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, this limits the gamma-carboxylation and subsequent activation of the vitamin K-dependent coagulant proteins."
1194,DB01419,"Antrafenine is used as an anti-inflammatory and analgesic agent for the relief of mild to moderate pain.Antrafenine is a piperazine derivative drug that acts as an analgesic and anti-inflammatory drug with similar efficacy to naproxen. It is not widely used as it has largely been replaced by newer drugs.Its mode of action is not fully understood; however, its ability to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis may be involved in the anti-inflammatory effect.Antrafenine is believed to be associated with the inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity. Two unique cyclooxygenases have been described in mammals. The constitutive cyclooxygenase, COX-1, synthesizes prostaglandins necessary for normal gastrointestinal and renal function. Inhibition of COX-1 is thought to be associated with gastrointestinal and renal toxicity while inhibition of COX-2 provides anti-inflammatory activity."
1195,DB01420,"Testosterone propionate is used in veterinary practice in heifers in order to stimulate maximal growth.Testosterone propionate is a slower-releasing anabolic steroid with a short half-life. It is a synthetic androstane steroid derivative of testosterone in the form of 17Î² propionate ester of testosterone. Testosterone propionate was developed initially by Watson labs, and FDA approved on February 5, 1974. Currently, this drug has been discontinued in humans, but the vet application is still available as an OTC.The administration of testosterone propionate can induce production of proteins related to male sexual development. Clinical trials have shown a decrease in plasma LH after the administration of testosterone propionate.The effects of testosterone in humans and other vertebrates occur by way of two main mechanisms: by activation of the androgen receptor (directly or as DHT), and by conversion to estradiol and activation of certain estrogen receptors."

Currently used to measure total body water.Aminophenazone is a pyrazolone with analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties that carries a risk of agranulocytosis. In biomedical applications, radiolabelled (13C-labeled) aminophenazone has been used in breath tests to measure the cytochrome P-450 metabolic activity in liver function tests. The FDA suspended the use of aminophenazone due to its association with agranulocytosis, a life-threatening side effect.Aminophenazone exhibits analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties.Aminophenazone is metabolized very slowly by normal newborn babies. In older infants, a higher amount of exhaled 13-CO2 is observed."
1198,DB01426,"For use as an antiarrhythmic agent.An alkaloid found in the root of Rauwolfia serpentina, among other plant sources. Ajmaline produces potent sodium channel blocking effects and a very short half-life which makes it a very useful drug for acute intravenous treatments. The drug has been very popular in some countries for the treatment of atrial fibrillation in patients with the WolffâParkinsonâWhite syndrome and in well tolerated monomorphic ventricular tachycardias. By interfering with the sodium channels, this drug allows for improvement in abnormal rhythms of the heartThe class I antiarrhythmic agents interfere with the sodium channel. A class IA agent lengthens the action potential (right shift) which brings about improvement in abnormal heart rhythms."

1201,DB01432,"Indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet for the reduction of elevated serum cholesterol in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (elevated low density lipoprotein  cholesterol) who do not respond adequately to diet. Bile acid sequestrants are polymeric compounds which serve as ion exchange resins. Cholestyramine resin adsorbs and combines with the bile acids in the intestine to form an insoluble complex which is excreted in the feces. This results in a partial removal of bile acids from the enterohepatic circulation by preventing their absorption.Cholestyramine forms a resin that acts as a bile acid sequestrant to limit the reabsorption of bile acids in the gastrointestinal tract. Cholestyramine resin is a strong anion exchange resin, allowing it to exchange its chloride anions with anionic bile acids present in the gastrointestinal tract and form a strong resin matrix."
1202,DB01435,"Antipyrine is an analgesic often used to test effects of other drugs on liver enzymes. Antipyrine is often used in testing the effects of other drugs or diseases on drug-metabolizing enzymes in the liver. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p29)Antipyrine is an analgesic and antipyretic that has been given by mouth and as ear drops. Antipyrine is often used in testing the effects of other drugs or diseases on drug-metabolizing enzymes in the liver. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p29)Antipyrine is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis."
1203,DB01436,"Alfacalcidol is indicated in adult patients with chronic renal failure for the management of hypocalcemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, or osteodystrophy. In approving European countries, alfacalcidol is also indicated for managing nutritional and malabsorptive rickets and osteomalacia, vitamin D-dependent rickets and osteomalacia, and hypophosphataemic vitamin D resistant rickets and osteomalacia.Alfacalcidol works to increase serum levels of calcium by stimulating intestinal calcium absorption, reabsorption of calcium from bone, and possibly the renal reabsorption of calcium. In patients with chronic renal failure, serum calcium levels were elevated while parathyroid hormone and alkaline phosphatase levels returned to normal levels within five days following alfacalcidol administration. Since alfacalcidol suppresses parathyroid hormone, a reduction in parathyroid hormone levels is achieved more rapidly in patients on intermittent intravenous therapy, with significant reductions occurring within three months of therapy. In patients with nutritional osteomalacia, alfacalcidol increased calcium absorption with six hours of oral administration and the effects peaked at 24 hours.In conditions like chronic renal failure, renal bone disease, hypoparathyroidism, and vitamin D dependent rickets, the kidneys' capacity for 1Î±-hydroxylation is impaired, leading to reduced production of endogenous 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and aberrated mineral metabolism."
1204,DB01437,"For the treatment of insomnia.Glutethimide is a hypnotic and sedative. Its use has been largely superseded by other drugs.Glutethimide, like the barbiturates, is a hypnotic sedative. It was introduced in 1954 as a safer alternative to barbiturates but was soon determined to be just as likely to cause addiction and withdrawal symptoms.Glutethimide seems to be a GABA agonist which helps induce sedation. It also induces CYP 2D6. When taken with codeine, it enables the body to convert higher amounts of codeine (higher than the average 5 - 10%) to morphine."
1205,DB01438,"Phenazopyridine may be used in combination with antimicrobial therapy but is not used as an antimicrobial agent. Phenazopyridine is available in many countries as an over the counter drug.Phenazopyridine, also known as Pyridium, is a urinary tract analgesic used for the short-term management of urinary tract irritation and its associated unpleasant symptoms such as burning and pain during urination. This may be a consequence of overdose, decreased renal function, taking the drug for over two days. Elderly patients may be at particular risk due to a decline in renal function, potentiating the risk of phenazopyridine accumulation. In addition to the above effects, this drug may impart an orange or red color of urine and feces, causing staining of clothing."
1206,DB01440,"Used as a general anesthetic, to treat conditions such as insomnia, clinical depression, narcolepsy, and alcoholism, and to improve athletic performance. Gamma hydroxybutyric acid, commonly abbreviated GHB, is a therapeutic drug which is illegal in multiple countries. It is currently regulated in the US and sold by Jazz Pharmaceuticals under the name Xyrem. Today Xyrem is a Schedule III drug; however GHB remains a Schedule I drug and the illicit use of Xyrem falls under penalties of Schedule I. GHB is a naturally occurring substance found in the central nervous system, wine, beef, small citrus fruits and almost all other living creatures in small amounts. At higher concentrations, GHB inhibits dopamine release by acting on the GABA-B receptors, which is followed by GHB receptor signaling and increased release of dopamine."
1207,DB01452,"However, under the name diamorphine, heroin is a legal prescription drug in the United Kingdom.The onset of heroin's effects is dependent on the method of administration. Once in the brain, heroin is rapidly metabolized into morphine by removal of the acetyl groups, therefore making it a prodrug for the delivery of morphine . Subsequently, whether eliciting actions peripherally (on smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, kidney, lung, liver, or spleen tissue , for example) or on the central nervous system, it is ultimately the morphine metabolite of heroin that then binds with opioid receptors and produces the narcotic opioid effects commonly associated with the substance .When administered orally, diamorphine experiences extensive first-pass metabolism by way of deacetylation to generate the active metabolites 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) and morphine . Despite diamorphine possessing little to no opioid agonist activity itself, its rapid transit across the blood-brain-barrier elicits a far faster onset of activity in comparison to the extensive first-pass metabolism of oral administration . Morphine, along with other opioids, are agonists to four endogenous neurotransmitters ."
1208,DB01501,"Motofen(R) is a combination of atropine, an anticholinergic drug, and difenoxin, an antidiarrheal drug. Diarrhea which is a result of cyclic or diarrhea predominant Inflammatory Bowel Syndrome may not be treated effectively with difenoxin, diphenoxylate, or loperamide. It is approved by the FDA to treat acute and chronic diarrhea. Difenoxin is an active metabolite of the anti-diarrheal drug, diphenoxylate, which is also used in combination with atropine in the brand mixture Lomotil(R). However, the antidiarrheal potency of difenoxin is much greater than its CNS effects, which makes it an attractive alternative to other opioids.Difenoxin acts as a potent antidiarrheal by slowing the movement of the intestines."
1209,DB01544,"For short-term treatment of severe insomnias, that are not responsive to other hypnotics.Flunitrazepam is a benzodiazepine with pharmacologic actions similar to those of diazepam that can cause anterograde amnesia. The United States Government has banned the importation of this drug.Flunitrazepam is a powerful hypnotic drug that is a benzodiazepine derivative. The drug is sometimes used as a date rape drug. In the United States, the drug has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for medical use, and is considered to be an illegal drug. As benzodiazepine receptors are thought to be coupled to gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptors, this enhances the effects of GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA receptor."
1210,DB01551,"Dihydrocodeine is used for the treatment of moderate to severe pain, including post-operative and dental pain . It  can also be used to treat chronic pain , breathlessness and coughing. In heroin addicts, dihydrocodeine has been used as a substitute drug, in doses up to 2500mg/day to treat addiction.Dihydrocodeine is an opioid analgesic used as an alternative or adjunct to codeine to treat moderate to severe pain, severe dyspnea, and cough. It was marketed in 1911.Possible opioid related side effects include, but are not limited to, drowsiness, nausea, headache, dry mouth, constipation, difficulty passing urine, and mild euphoria. Dihydrocodeine is metabolized to dihydromorphine -- a highly active metabolite with a high affinity for mu opioid receptors."
1211,DB01558,"For the short-term treatment of insomnia, short-term treatment of anxiety or panic attacks, if a benzodiazepine is required, and the alleviation of the symptoms of alcohol- and opiate-withdrawal.One of the benzodiazepines that is used in the treatment of anxiety disorders. It is a intermediate-acting benzodiazepine.Bromazepam is a lipophilic, long-acting benzodiazepine and with sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. It does not possess any antidepressant qualities. According to many psychiatric experts, Bromazepam has a greater abuse potential than other benzodiazepines because of fast resorption and rapid onset of action.Bromazepam binds to the GABA-A receptor producing a conformational change and potentiating its inhibitory effects. Other neurotransmitters are not influenced."
1212,DB01559,"For the treatment of anxiety disorders.Clotiazepam is a thienodiazepine, not approved for sale in the U.S. or Canada, but has been approved in the U.K. It is a schedule IV drug in Canada.Clotiazepam is a thienodiazepine possessing anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. It increases the stage 2 non-rapid eye movement sleep.Clotiazepam acts at the benzodiazepine receptors (BZD). This agonizes the action of GABA, increasing the frequency of opening of the channel chlorinates and penetration of the ions chlorinates through the ionophore. Increase in membrane polarization decreases the probability of discharge of neurons."
1213,DB01563,"Mainly used as a hypnotic in the treatment of insomnia; however, it is only effective as a hypnotic for short-term use. May be used as a routine sedative preoperatively to decrease anxiety and cause sedation and/or sleep with respiration depression or cough reflex. A hypnotic and sedative used in the treatment of insomnia. The safety margin is too narrow for chloral hydrate to be used as a general anesthetic in humans, but it is commonly used for that purpose in animal experiments. It is no longer considered useful as an anti-anxiety medication."

1215,DB01576,"Dextroamphetamine is indicated for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).Dextroamphetamine is the dextrorotatory enantiomer of amphetamine. Dextroamphetamine was approved by the FDA in 2001 for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.Dextroamphetamine is a noncatecholamine, sympathomimetic amine that acts as a CNS stimulant. The general mechanism of action of dextroamphetamine has not been well established.The exact mechanism of amphetamines as a class is not known. Dextroamphetamine acts by preventing reuptake, increasing release, and stimulating reverse-transport of dopamine in synaptic clefts in the striatum. Newer evidence shows amphetamines may also alter the number of dopamine transporters in synaptic clefts."
1216,DB01577,"For the treatment of Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity (ADHD) and exogenous obesity.Metamfetamine (methamphetamine) is a psychostimulant and sympathomimetic drug, and a member of the amphetamine group of sympathomimetic amines. Methamphetamine can induce effects such as euphoria, increased alertness and energy, and enhanced self-esteem. It is a scheduled drug in most countries due to its high potential for addiction and abuse. The acute effects of the drug closely resemble the physiological and psychological effects of an epinephrine-provoked fight-or-flight response, including increased heart rate and blood pressure, vasoconstriction (constriction of the arterial walls), bronchodilation, and hyperglycemia (increased blood sugar). Users experience an increase in focus, increased mental alertness, and the elimination of fatigue, as well as a decrease in appetite."
1217,DB01579,"Phendimetrazine is chemically related to amphetamines and is a Schedule III drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances and in the US since 1970.Phendimetrazine is a phenylalkylamine sympathomimetic amine with pharmacological activity similar to the prototype drugs of this class used in obesity, the amphetamines. Tachyphylaxis and tolerance has been demonstrated with all drugs of this class in which these phenomena have been looked for. Drugs of this class used in obesity are commonly known as ''anorectics or anorexigenics."" It has not been established, however, that the action of such drugs in treating obesity is primarily one of appetite suppression. Other central nervous system actions or metabolic effects, may be involved.Phendimetrazine may act in a similar way to amphetamines in that it activates the alpha-adrenergic system to induce an appetite suppressive and metabolic increase effect."
1218,DB01580,"Used in the treatment of hypertension, angina pectoris, arrhythmias, and anxiety.A beta-adrenergic antagonist used in the treatment of hypertension, angina pectoris, arrhythmias, and anxiety.Oxprenolol is a non-selective beta blocker with some intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Oxprenolol is a lipophilic molecule and hence, it is able to cross the blood-brain barrier. As such, it is associated with a higher incidence of CNS-related side effects than hydrophilic ligands such as atenolol, sotalol and nadolol. Oxprenolol is an potent beta-blocker and should not be administered to asthmatics because it can cause irreversible airway failure and inflammation.Like other beta-adrenergic antagonists, oxprenolol competes with adrenergic neurotransmitters such as catecholamines for binding at sympathetic receptor sites. Like propranolol and timolol, oxprenolol binds at beta(1)-adrenergic receptors in the heart and vascular smooth muscle, inhibiting the effects of the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine and decreasing heart rate, cardiac output, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure."

It has a spectrum of antimicrobial action similar to other sulfonamides.Sulfamethazine is a sulfonamide drug that inhibits bacterial synthesis of dihydrofolic acid by competing with para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) for binding to dihydropteroate synthetase (dihydrofolate synthetase). Sulfamethazine is bacteriostatic in nature. Inhibition of dihydrofolic acid synthesis decreases the synthesis of bacterial nucleotides and DNA. Sulfonamides inhibit the enzymatic conversion of pteridine and p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) to dihydropteroic acid by competing with PABA for binding to dihydrofolate synthetase, an intermediate of tetrahydrofolic acid (THF) synthesis."
1221,DB01583,"May also be used to suppress thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion in patients with simple (nontoxic) goiter, subacute or chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis multinodular goiter, and in the management of thyroid cancer.May also be used for differential diagnosis of suspected mild hyperthyroidism or thyroid gland autonomy.Liotrix is a synthetically derived thyroid hormone replacement preparation. It is now known that the thyroid gland secretes approximately ten times more T4 than T3 and that 80% of serum T3 is derived from deiodination of T4 in peripheral tissues. These hormones enhance oxygen consumption by most tissues of the body and increase the basal metabolic rate and the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins. Thus, they exert a profound influence on every organ system in the body and are of particular importance in the development of the central nervous system.The hormones, T4 and T3, are tyrosine-based hormones produced by the thyroid gland. Thyroid hormones are essential for proper development and differentiation of all cells of the human body."

It is also used to prevent gallstone formation in obese patients experiencing rapid weight loss.Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), also known as ursodiol, is a naturally-occurring bile acid that constitutes a minor fraction of the human bile acid pool. UDCA works by replacing the hydrophobic or more toxic bile acids from the bile acid pool.Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is a secondary bile acid with cytoprotectant, immunomodulating, and choleretic effects. UDCA increases bile acid flow and promotes the secretion of bile acids.Endogenous hydrophobic bile acids such as deoxycholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid can exert hepatotoxic effects. It increases the absorption of hydrophilic bile acids."
1223,DB01587,"In approved countries, it is indicated for the treatment of anxiety, tension, irritability and similar stress related symptoms.Ketazolam is a benzodiazepine derivative with anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant activity. As benzodiazepine receptors are thought to be coupled to gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptors, this enhances the effects of GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA receptor. Binding of GABA to the site opens the chloride channel, resulting in a hyperpolarized cell membrane that prevents further excitation of the cell.Benzodiazepines share a similar chemical structure and their effects in humans are mainly produced by the allosteric modification of a specific kind of neurotransmitter receptor, the GABAA receptor, which increases the conductance of this inhibitory channel; this results in the various therapeutic effects as well as adverse effects of benzodiazepines. This increased conductance raises the membrane potential of the neuron resulting in inhibition of neuronal firing. In addition, different GABAA receptor subtypes have varying distributions within different regions of the brain and therefore control distinct neuronal circuits."
1224,DB01588,"For the treatment of anxiety disorders.Prazepam is a benzodiazepine that is used in the treatment of anxiety disorders. It is a schedule IV drug in the U.S.Prazepam is a benzodiazepine derivative with anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant activity. Benzodiazepines may be habit-forming (causing mental or physical dependence), especially when taken for a long time or in high doses.Prazepam is believed to stimulate GABA receptors in the ascending reticular activating system. Since GABA is inhibitory, receptor stimulation increases inhibition and blocks both cortical and limbic arousal following stimulation of the brain stem reticular formation."
1225,DB01589,"It was first approved in the US in 1985 and is used as a hypnotic for the treatment of insomnia. It appears to be unique amongst other benzodiazepine derivatives in its relatively high affinity for sleep-promoting Î±1 subunit-containing GABAA receptors and low affinity for other receptors.Benzodiazepines, including quazepam, exert their sedative and anxiolytic effects by potentiating the effects of endogenous GABA, the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system.Like other benzodiazepines, quazepam likely exerts its effects by potentiating the effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on GABA(A) receptors, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the mammalian brain. GABA(A) receptors are a component of GABA-gated ionotropic chloride channels that produce inhibitory postsynaptic potentials - following activation by GABA, the channel undergoes a conformational change that allows the passage of chloride ions through the channel. Benzodiazepines are positive allosteric modulators of GABA(A) function. They bind to the interface between alpha (Î±) and gamma (Î³) subunits on the receptor, commonly referred to as the benzodiazepine binding site, and modulate the receptor such that its inhibitory response to GABA binding is dramatically increased."
1226,DB01590,"Indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after failure of treatment with sunitinib or sorafenib. Indicated in pediatric and adult patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) for the treatment of subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) that requires therapeutic intervention but cannot be curatively resected.Everolimus is a derivative of Rapamycin (sirolimus), and works similarly to Rapamycin as an mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor. It is currently used as an immunosuppressant to prevent rejection of organ transplants. In a similar fashion to other mTOR inhibitors Everolimus' effect is solely on the mTORC1 protein and not on the mTORC2 protein.Everolimus is a mTOR inhibitor that binds with high affinity to the FK506 binding protein-12 (FKBP-12), thereby forming a drug complex that inhibits the activation of mTOR. This inhibition reduces the activity of effectors downstream, which leads to a blockage in the progression of cells from G1 into S phase, and subsequently inducing cell growth arrest and apoptosis."
1227,DB01591,"Solifenacin tablets are indicated to treat an overactive bladder with urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency.Solifenacin is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist indicated to treat an overactive bladder with urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency. It has a long duration of action as it is usually taken once daily. It has a long duration of action as it is usually taken once daily. It has the highest affinity for M3, M1, and M2 muscarinic receptors. 80% of the muscarinic receptors in the bladder are M2, while 20% are M3."
1228,DB01592,"Used in preventing and treating iron-deficiency anemia.A metallic element found in certain minerals, in nearly all soils, and in mineral waters. It is an essential constituent of hemoglobin, cytochrome, and other components of respiratory enzyme systems. Its chief functions are in the transport of oxygen to tissue (hemoglobin) and in cellular oxidation mechanisms. Iron is used to build up the blood in anemia.The major activity of supplemental iron is in the prevention and treatment of iron deficiency anemia. Iron-deficiency can lead to decreased production of hemoglobin and a microcytic, hypochromic anemia."
1229,DB01593,"It is required for the catalytic activity of more than 200 enzymes, and it plays a role in immune function wound healing, protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, and cell division. In HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 . There are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production . Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels ."
1230,DB01595,"Used to treat short-term sleeping problems (insomnia), such as difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings during the night, and early-morning awakening.A benzodiazepine derivative used as an anticonvulsant and hypnotic.Nitrazepam is a type of benzodiazepine drug. It is a powerful hypnotic drug which possesses strong sedative, anxiolytic, amnestic, anticonvulsant, and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. Nitrazepam shortens the time required to fall asleep and lengthens the duration of sleep. It is also useful for the management of myoclonic seizures.Nitrazepam belongs to a group of medicines called benzodiazepines. This drug affects central benzodiazepine receptors, which are associated with inhibitory GABA (gamma amino butyric acid)receptors, leading to enhanced GABA binding activity."
1231,DB01597,"Cilastatin is indicated, in combination with  with or without , for the treatment of bacterial infections including respiratory, skin, bone, gynecologic, urinary tract, and intra-abdominal as well as septicemia and endocarditis.Cilastatin is an inhibitor of renal dehydropeptidase, an enzyme responsible for both the metabolism of thienamycin beta-lactam antibiotics as well as conversion of leukotriene D4 to leukotriene E4. The first combination product containing both drugs was approved by the FDA in November of 1985 under the trade name Primaxin, marketed by Merck & Co. A newer triple-drug product was approved in July 2019 under the trade name Recarbrio which also contains .Cilastatin is a chemical compound which inhibits the human enzyme dehydropeptidase. Cilastatin is therefore combined intravenously with imipenem in order to protect it from dehydropeptidase and prolong its antibacterial effect. However, cilastatin in and of itself does not have any antibacterial activity. Since the antibiotic, imipenem, is hydrolyzed by dehydropeptidase-I, which resides in the brush border of the renal tubule, cilastatin is administered with imipenem to block the metabolism of imipenem."
1232,DB01598,"Imipenem is a semisynthetic thienamycin that has a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-negative and gram-positive aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including many multiresistant strains. It is stable to many beta-lactamases. Imipenem is commonly used in combination with  and is now available in a triple-drug product with cilastatin and  which was recently approved by the FDA. It exerts a bactericidal effects by disrupting cell wall synthesis.Imipenem acts as an antimicrobial through the inhibition of cell wall synthesis of various gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. This inhibition of cell wall synthesis in gram-negative bateria is attained by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs)."
1233,DB01599,"Used to lower LDL and HDL cholesterol.A drug used to lower LDL and HDL cholesterol yet has little effect on serum-triglyceride or VLDL cholesterol. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p993).Probucol lowers cholesterol levels by increasing LDL (low-density lipoprotein) breakdown. Additionally, probucol may inhibit cholesterol synthesis and delay cholesterol absorption. Probucol is a powerful antioxidant drug normally used to prevent vascular disease caused by the free radicals in the body.Probucol lowers serum cholesterol by increasing the fractional rate of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) catabolism in the final metabolic pathway for cholesterol elimination from the body. This drug may also act to inhibit the initial stages of cholesterol synthesis and act to inhibit the absorption of cholesterol from the diet."
1234,DB01600,"Tiaprofenic acid is used to treat pain, especially arthritic pain.Tiaprofenic acid is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug employed in the treatment of pain, particularly arthritis pain. It belongs to the _arylpropionic acid_ (profen) group of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).Tiaprofenic acid is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug of the arylpropionic acid (profen) class, used to treat pain, especially arthritic pain. The typical adult dose is 300mg twice daily. It works by blocking the production of a chemical (prostaglandin) which the body produces in response to injury or certain diseases. This prostaglandin would otherwise go on to cause swelling, pain and inflammation."
1235,DB01601,"Like many other protease inhibitors (e.g. , ), lopinavir is a peptidomimetic molecule - it contains a hydroxyethylene scaffold that mimics the peptide linkage typically targeted by the HIV-1 protease enzyme but which itself cannot be cleaved, thus preventing the activity of the HIV-1 protease. At the center of this lifecycle is the Gag polyprotein which, along with the products of its proteolysis, coordinate these stages and function as the major structural proteins of the virus. The HIV-1 protease enzyme, a dimeric aspartic protease, is the enzyme responsible for cleaving the Gag polyprotein and thus plays a critical role in many aspects of the HIV viral lifecycle. Lopinavir is an inhibitor of the HIV-1 protease enzyme. By preventing HIV-1 protease activity, and thus the proteolysis of the Gag polyprotein, lopinavir results in the production of immature, non-infectious viral particles."

It is inactivated by gastric acid so administered by injection.Meticillin (INN, BAN) or methicillin (USAN) is a narrow spectrum beta-lactam antibiotic of the penicillin class. It is no longer clinically used. Its role in therapy has been largely replaced by flucloxacillin and dicloxacillin, however the term methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) continues to be used to describe Staphylococcus aureus strains resistant to all penicillins.Similar to other beta-lactam antimicrobials, meticillin blocks synthesis of the bacterial cell wall. Meticillin stops cross-linkage between the peptidoglycan polymer chains, which make up a large portion of gram-positive bacterial cell walls."

1240,DB01606,"Certain gram-negative bacilli infections with beta-lactamase producing organisms cannot be treated with piperacillin-tazobactam, due to a gene mutation conferring antibiotic resistance. **Tazobactam-ceftolozane**    Tazobactam is used in combination with  for the treatment of infections caused by designated susceptible microorganisms in adult and pediatric patients:    - Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections (cIAI), used in combination with   - Complicated Urinary Tract Infections (cUTI), including pyelonephritis  - Hospital-acquired Bacterial Pneumonia and Ventilator-associated Bacterial Pneumonia (HABP/VABP)Tazobactam is an antibiotic of the beta-lactamase inhibitor class that prevents the breakdown of other antibiotics by beta-lactamase enzyme producing organisms. In June 2019, ceftolozane-tazobactam was approved by the FDA for treating hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia, which are significant causes of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients.Tazobactam inhibits the action of bacterial beta-lactamase producing organisms, which are normally resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. This occurs through the irreversible inhibition of beta-lactamase enzymes. In addition, tazobactam may bind covalently to plasmid-mediated and chromosome-mediated beta-lactamase enzymes."
1241,DB01607,"For the treatment of bacterial infections.An antibiotic derived from penicillin similar to carbenicillin in action.Ticarcillin is a semisynthetic antibiotic with a broad spectrum of bactericidal activity against many gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Ticarcillin is, however, susceptible to degradation by Ã-lactamases, and therefore, the spectrum of activity does not normally include organisms which produce these enzymes.Ticarcillin's principal mechanism of action revolves around its capacity to prevent the cross-linking of peptidoglycan during bacterial cell wall synthesis. Consequently, when the offending bacteria attempt to undergo cell division, cell death occurs."
1242,DB01608,"For use as adjunctive medication in some psychotic patients. Periciazine is a phenothiazine of the piperidine group. It has been shown to reduce pathologic arousal and affective tension in some psychotic patients, while the symptoms of abnormal mental integration are relatively unaffected. It is used as an adjunctive medication in some psychotic patients, for the control of residual prevailing hostility, impulsiveness and aggressiveness. It also has adrenolytic, anticholinergic, metabolic and endocrine effects, and an action on the extrapyramidal system.Pericyazine, like other phenothiazines, is presumed to act principally in the subcortical areas, by producing what has been described as a central adrenergic blockade of the alpha adrenergic receptors as well as antagonism of the D(1) dopamine receptor."
1243,DB01609,"For the treatment of chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions (transfusional hemosiderosis) in patients 2 years of age and older.Deferasirox is an iron chelator and the first oral medication FDA approved for chronic iron overload in patients receiving long term blood transfusions.Deferasirox is an orally active chelator that is selective for iron (as Fe3+). It is a tridentate ligand that binds iron with high affinity in a 2:1 ratio. Although deferasirox has very low affinity for zinc and copper there are variable decreases in the serum concentration of these trace metals after the administration of deferasirox. The clinical significance of these decreases is uncertain.Two molecules of deferasirox are capable of binding to 1 atom of iron. Deferasirox works in treating iron toxicity by binding trivalent (ferric) iron (for which it has a strong affinity), forming a stable complex which is eliminated via the kidneys."
1244,DB01610,"After oral administration, it is rapidly converted to ganciclovir by intestinal and hepatic esterases.Valganciclovir is an antiviral medication used to treat cytomegalovirus infections. This results in the termination of the elongation of viral DNA.Valganciclovir is a prodrug of ganciclovir that exists as a mixture of two diastereomers. In cytomegalovirus (CMV)-infected cells, ganciclovir is initially phosphorylated to the monophosphate form by viral protein kinase, then it is further phosphorylated via cellular kinases to produce the triphosphate form. This results in the prevention of DNA synthesis, as phosphodiester bridges can longer to be built, destabilizing the strand. Ganciclovir inhibits viral DNA polymerases more effectively than it does cellular polymerase, and chain elongation resumes when ganciclovir is removed."
1245,DB01611,"Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are both being investigated for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Altering the pH of the lysosomes reduces low-affinity self-antigen presentation in autoimmune diseases and interferes with the ability of plasmodia to proteolyze hemoglobin for their energy requirements. Hydroxychloroquine is not effective against malaria in areas where chloroquine resistance has been reported.The exact mechanisms of hydroxychloroquine are unknown. It has been shown that hydroxychloroquine accumulates in the lysosomes of the malaria parasite, raising the pH of the vacuole. Hydroxychloroquine inhibits terminal glycosylation of ACE2, the receptor that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 target for cell entry."
1246,DB01612,"For the rapid relief of angina pectoris.Amyl Nitrite is an antihypertensive medicine. Amyl nitrite is employed medically to treat heart diseases such as angina and to treat cyanide poisoning. Its use as a prescription medicine comes from its ability to lower blood pressure. As an inhalant, it also has psychoactive effect which has led to illegal drug use.Amyl nitrite, in common with other alkyl nitrites, is a potent vasodilator. Alkyl nitrite functions as a source of nitric oxide, which signals for relaxation of the involuntary muscles."
1247,DB01613,"For the prevention of angina.A vasodilator with general properties similar to nitroglycerin. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p1020)Erythrityl Tetranitrate is a vasodilator with general properties similar to nitroglycerin.Similar to other nitrites and organic nitrates, erythrityl tetranitrate is converted to an active intermediate compound which activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase. This stimulates the synthesis of cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) which then activates a series of protein kinase-dependent phosphorylations in the smooth muscle cells, eventually resulting in the dephosphorylation of the myosin light chain of the smooth muscle fiber. The subsequent release of calcium ions results in the relaxation of the smooth muscle cells and vasodilation."
1248,DB01616,"Alverine is a smooth muscle relaxant used to relieve cramps or spasms of the stomach and intestines. It can also be used to help relieve period pain.Alverine is a smooth muscle relaxant. This prevents the muscle spasms which occur in the gut in conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome and diverticular disease. By relaxing the gut muscle, alverine citrate relieves the symptoms of this condition. It is therefore also used to treat painful menstruation, which is caused by muscle spasms in the uterus (dysmenorrhea)."
1249,DB01618,"Molindone is used for the management of the manifestations of psychotic disorders.An indole derivative effective in schizophrenia and other psychoses and possibly useful in the treatment of the aggressive type of undersocialized conduct disorder. Molindone has much lower affinity for D2 receptors than most antipsychotic agents and has a relatively low affinity for D1 receptors. It has only low to moderate affinity for cholinergic and alpha-adrenergic receptors. Molindone has a pharmacological profile in laboratory animals which predominantly resembles that of major tranquilizers causing reduction of spontaneous locomotion and aggressiveness, suppression of a conditioned response and antagonism of the bizarre stereotyped behavior and hyperactivity induced by amphetamines. In addition, molindone antagonizes the depression caused by the tranquilizing agent tetrabenazine.The exact mechanism has not been established, however, based on electroencephalogram (EEG) studies, molindone is thought to act by occupying (antagonizing) dopamine (D2) receptor sites in the reticular limbic systems in the brain, thus decreasing dopamine activity."
1250,DB01619,"Used to treat sneezing, runny nose, itching, watery eyes, hives, rashes, itching, and other symptoms of allergies and the common cold.Phenindamine is an antihistamine. Phenindamine blocks the effects of the naturally occurring chemical histamine in your body. The antihistamines antagonize those pharmacological effects of histamine which are mediated through activation of H1- receptor sites and thereby reduce the intensity of allergic reactions and tissue injury response involving histamine release. Phenindamine blocks the effects of the naturally occurring chemical histamine in your body. By inhibiting the binding of histamine, antihistamines decrease the normal histamine response from cells, consequently decreasing allergic symptoms.Antihistamines such as phenindamine appear to compete with histamine for histamine H1- receptor sites on effector cells."
1251,DB01620,"Pheniramine is commonly used in over-the-counter products to treat seasonal allergies or cold and flu symptoms.Pheniramine is a first-generation antihistamine in the alkylamine class, similar to  and . It is used in   some over-the-counter allergy as well as cold & flu products in combination with other drugs. The reduction in H1 receptor activity is responsible for reduced itching as well as reduced vasodilation and capillary leakage leading to less redness and edema. This can be seen in the suppression of the histamine-induced wheal (swelling) and flare (vasodilation) response. Inverse agonism of the H1 receptor in the CNS is also responsible for the sedation produced by first-generation antihistamines like pheniramine."
1252,DB01621,"For the maintenance treatment of chronic non-agitated schizophrenic patients.Pipotiazine has actions similar to those of other phenothiazines. Among the different phenothiazine derivatives, it appears to be less sedating and to have a weak propensity for causing hypotension or potentiating the effects of CNS depressants and anesthetics. However, it produces a high incidence of extra pyramidal reactions.

However, it produces a high incidence of extra pyramidal reactions."
1253,DB01623,"For the management of schizophrenia.A thioxanthine used as an antipsychotic agent. Its effects are similar to the phenothiazine antipsychotics.Thiothixene is an antipsychotic of the thioxanthene series. Navane possesses certain chemical and pharmacological similarities to the piperazine phenothiazines and differences from the aliphatic group of phenothiazines. Although widely used in the treatment of schizophrenia for several decades, thiothixene is seldom used today in favor of atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone.Thiothixene acts as an antagonist (blocking agent) on different postsysnaptic receptors -on dopaminergic-receptors (subtypes D1, D2, D3 and D4 - different antipsychotic properties on productive and unproductive symptoms), on serotonergic-receptors (5-HT1 and 5-HT2, with anxiolytic, antidepressive and antiaggressive properties as well as an attenuation of extrapypramidal side-effects, but also leading to weight gain, fall in blood pressure, sedation and ejaculation difficulties), on histaminergic-receptors (H1-receptors, sedation, antiemesis, vertigo, fall in blood pressure and weight gain), alpha1/alpha2-receptors (antisympathomimetic properties, lowering of blood pressure, reflex tachycardia, vertigo, sedation, hypersalivation and incontinence as well as sexual dysfunction, but may also attenuate pseudoparkinsonism - controversial) and finally on muscarinic (cholinergic) M1/M2-receptors (causing anticholinergic symptoms like dry mouth, blurred vision, obstipation, difficulty/inability to urinate, sinus tachycardia, ECG-changes and loss of memory, but the anticholinergic action may attenuate extrapyramidal side-effects)."

It is used in the treatment of peptic ulcer and other gastrointestinal disorders marked by hyperacidity and hypermotility.Anticholinergics are a class of medications that inhibit parasympathetic nerve impulses by selectively blocking the binding of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine to its receptor in nerve cells. The nerve fibers of the parasympathetic system are responsible for the involuntary movements of smooth muscles present in the gastrointestinal tract. Inhibition here decreases acidity and motility, aiding in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders."
1256,DB01626,"For the treatment of moderate to severe hypertension.Pargyline is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor with antihypertensive properties.Pargyline is a monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor with antihypertensive properties. Patients taking pargyline must avoid concurrent consumption of tyramine-containing foods such as bleu cheese and beer, as this can lead to a hypertensive crisis.MAOIs act by inhibiting the activity of monoamine oxidase, thus preventing the breakdown of monoamine neurotransmitters and thereby increasing their availability. There are two isoforms of monoamine oxidase, MAO-A and MAO-B. MAO-A preferentially deaminates serotonin, melatonin, epinephrine and norepinephrine. MAO-B preferentially deaminates phenylethylamine and trace amines."
1257,DB01627,"As with all antibacterial agents, lincomycin should only be used to treat infections proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria.Lincomycin is a lincosamide antibiotic first isolated from the soil bacterium Streptomyces lincolnensis in Lincoln, Nebraska. Clinical use of lincomycin has largely been superseded by its semisynthetic derivative  due to its higher efficacy and a wider range of susceptible organisms, though lincomycin remains in use. It is also effective against anaerobic bacteria, though in this regard  is generally more potent. Lincomycin for injection may contain benzyl alcohol as a preservative, which has been associated with gasping syndrome in pediatric patients. Like all antibiotics, lincomycin use may cause overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, which should be considered.Lincomycin contains the unusual amino acid moiety propyl hygric acid linked to the sugar moiety Î±-methylthiolincosamine (Î±-MTL) that, like other lincosamides, functions as a structural analogue of the 3' end of L-Pro-Met-tRNA and deacylated-tRNA to interact with the 23S rRNA of the 50S bacterial ribosomal subunit."

DHEA is often prescribed in India for the induction of ovulation to improve chances of pregnancy.Prasterone, also known as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a major C19 steroid produced by the adrenal cortex. In the United States, DHEA or DHEAS have been advertised with claims that they may be beneficial for a wide variety of ailments. Some theorize that the increase in endogenous DHEA brought about by calorie restriction is partially responsible for the longer life expectancy known to be associated with calorie restriction.DHEA can be understood as a prohormone for the sex steroids. As most DHEA is produced by the zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex, it is argued that there is a role in the immune and stress response."

It has also been investigated for its hypolipidemic effects and as cholesterol lowering agent.Pantothenic acid, also called pantothenate or vitamin B5 (a B vitamin), is a water-soluble vitamin discovered by Roger J. Williams in 1919. CoA is thought to act as a carrier molecule, allowing the entry of acyl groups into cells. This is of critical importance as these acyl groups are used as substrates in the tricarboxylic acid cycle to generate energy and in the synthesis of fatty acids, cholesterol, and acetylcholine. Additionally, CoA is part of acyl carrier protein (ACP), which is required in the synthesis of fatty acids in addition to CoAs use as a substrate."
1264,DB02300,"For the treatment of moderate plaque psoriasis in adults.Calcipotriol (INN) or calcipotriene (USAN) is a sythetic derivative of calcitriol or Vitamin D.Calcipotriene is a synthetic analog of vitamin D. In humans, the natural supply of vitamin D depends mainly on exposure to the ultraviolet rays of the sun for conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) in the skin. The precise mechanism of calcipotriol in remitting psoriasis is not well-understood, however, it has been shown to have comparable affinity with calcitriol for the Vitamin D receptor while being less than 1% the activity in regulating calcium metabolism. The Vitamin D receptor (VDR) belongs to the steroid/thyroid receptor superfamily, and is found on the cells of many different tissues including the thyroid, bone, kindney, and T cells of the immune system. T cells are known to play a role in psoriasis and are believed to undergo modulation of gene expression with binding of calcipotriol to the VDR. This modulation is thought to affect gene products related to cell differentiation and proliferation."
1265,DB02546,"For the treatment of cutaneous manifestations in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma who have progressive, persistent or recurrent disease on or following two systemic therapies.Vorinostat (rINN) or suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), is a drug currently under investigation for the treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL), a type of skin cancer, to be used when the disease persists, gets worse, or comes back during or after treatment with other medicines. It is the first in a new class of agents known as histone deacetylase inhibitors. A recent study suggested that vorinostat also possesses some activity against recurrent glioblastoma multiforme, resulting in a median overall survival of 5.7 months (compared to 4 - 4.4 months in earlier studies). Further brain tumor trials are planned using combinations of vorinostat with other drugs.Vorinostat inhibits the enzymatic activity of histone deacetylases HDAC1, HDAC2 and HDAC3 (Class I) and HDAC6 (Class II) at nanomolar concentrations (IC50&lt; 86 nM). These enzymes catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from the lysine residues of histones proteins."
1266,DB02638,"Terlipressin increases arterial pressure (diastolic, systolic, and mean) and decreases heart rate in patients with hepatorenal syndrome type 1 (HRS-1). V3 receptors mediate the effects of vasopressin on the central nervous system. Shock conditions such as hypovolemia initially cause an increase in the release of vasopressin to maintain organ perfusion; however, as the shock state progresses, plasma vasopressin concentrations decrease due to several causes such as depleted stores of vasopressin in refractory shock and a central inhibitory effect of initially elevated vasopressin levels on further vasopressin release. Terlipressin is a synthetic vasopressin analogue that can cause sustained increases in blood pressure in patients with shock conditions. It exhibits twice the selectivity for vasopressin V1 receptors versus V2 receptors."
1267,DB02659,"Oral cholic acid is indicated for: treatment of bile acid synthesis disorders due to single enzyme defects; and as adjunctive treatment of peroxisomal disorders including Zellweger spectrum disorders in patients who exhibit manifestations of liver disease, steatorrhea or complications from decreased fat soluble vitamin absorption.

1268,DB02703,"For the treatment of bacterial infections.An antibiotic isolated from the fermentation broth of Fusidium coccineum. (From Merck Index, 11th ed) It acts by inhibiting translocation during protein synthesis. It is often used topically in creams and eyedrops but is available in systemic formulations including tablets and injections.Fusidic acid is a bacteriostatic antibiotic and helps prevent bacterial growth while the immune system clears the infection.Fusidic acid works by interfering with bacterial protein synthesis, specifically by preventing the translocation of the elongation factor G (EF-G) from the ribosome. It also can inhibit chloramphenicol acetyltransferase enzymes."
1269,DB02959,"For use as an antidepressant, appetite suppressant, and sleep aid.5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), also known as oxitriptan (INN), is a naturally occurring amino acid and metabolic intermediate in the synthesis of serotonin and melatonin. 5-HTP is sold over-the-counter in the United Kingdom, United States and Canada as a dietary supplement for use as an antidepressant, appetite suppressant, and sleep aid, and is also marketed in many European countries for the indication of major depression under trade names like Cincofarm, Levothym, Levotonine, Oxyfan, Telesol, Tript-OH, and Triptum. Several double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of 5-HTP in the treatment of depression, though a lack of high quality studies has been noted. More study is needed to determine efficacy in treating depression.The psychoactive action of 5-HTP is thought to be due to increased serotonin production in central nervous system tissue."
1270,DB03128,"Used to obtain miosis of the iris in seconds after delivery of the lens in cataract surgery, in penetrating keratoplasty, iridectomy and other anterior segment surgery where rapid miosis may be required.A neurotransmitter. Acetylcholine in vertebrates is the major transmitter at neuromuscular junctions, autonomic ganglia, parasympathetic effector junctions, a subset of sympathetic effector junctions, and at many sites in the central nervous system. It is generally not used as an administered drug because it is broken down very rapidly by cholinesterases, but it is useful in some ophthalmological applications."
1271,DB03166,"Used to treat infections in the ear canal.Acetic acid is a product of the oxidation of ethanol and of the destructive distillation of wood. It is used locally, occasionally internally, as a counterirritant and also as a reagent. (Stedman, 26th ed) Acetic acid otic (for the ear) is an antibiotic that treats infections caused by bacteria or fungus."
1272,DB03209,"Oteracil is used as an adjunct to antineoplastic therapy. When used within the product Teysuno, oteracil is indicated for the treatment of adults with advanced gastric (stomach) cancer when given in combination with cisplatin.Oteracil is an adjunct to antineoplastic therapy, used to reduce the toxic side effects associated with chemotherapy. The main active ingredient in Teysuno is , a pro-drug of  (5-FU), which is a cytotoxic anti-metabolite drug that acts on rapidly dividing cancer cells. By mimicking a class of compounds called ""pyrimidines"" that are essential components of RNA and DNA, 5-FU is able to insert itself into strands of DNA and RNA, thereby halting the replication process necessary for continued cancer growth. It functions by blocking the enzyme orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRT), which is involved in the production of 5-FU.Oteracil's main role within Teysuno is to reduce the activity of 5-FU within normal gastrointestinal mucosa, and therefore reduce's gastrointestinal toxicity ."
1273,DB03255,"Phenol is primarily indicated for minor sore throat pain, sore mouth, minor mouth irritation, and pain associated with canker sores. Additionally, phenol is indicated in the treatment of focal spasticity. It is active against a wide range of micro-organisms including some fungi and viruses, but is only slowly effective against spores. Phenol is also used as an oral analgesic or anesthetic in products such as Chloraseptic to treat pharyngitis. Additionally, phenol and its related compounds are used in surgical ingrown toenail treatment, a process termed phenolization."
1274,DB03404,"Used in the management of porphyria attacks, particularly in acute intermittent porphyria.Hemin (trade name Panhematin) is an iron-containing porphyrin. More specifically, it is protoporphyrin IX containing a ferric iron ion (heme B) with a chloride ligand."
1275,DB03619,"For improvement in appearance of moderate to severe fullness associated with submental fat in adults. Deoxycholic acid is a a bile acid which emulsifies and solubilizes dietary fats in the intestine, and when injected subcutaneously, it disrupts cell membranes in adipocytes and destroys fat cells in that tissue. In April 2015, deoxycholic acid was approved by the FDA for the treatment submental fat to improve aesthetic appearance and reduce facial fullness or convexity. This results in an inflammatory reaction and clearing of the adipose tissue remnants by macrophages. Deoxycholic acid's actions are reduced by albumin and tissue-associated proteins, therefore its effect is limited to protein-poor subcutaneous fat tissue."
1276,DB03754,"For the prevention and correction of metabolic acidosis.An organic amine proton acceptor. It is used in the synthesis of surface-active agents and pharmaceuticals; as an emulsifying agent for cosmetic creams and lotions, mineral oil and paraffin wax emulsions, as a biological buffer, and used as an alkalizer. (From Merck, 11th ed; Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p1424)"
1277,DB03756,"Used as a high-docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) oral supplement. Like other polyunsaturated fatty acids, DHA acts as a ligand at PPARs that plays an anti-inflammatory effect and regulate inflammatory gene expression and NFÎºB activation. DHA and its conversion to other lipid signalling moleccules compete with the arachidonic acid cascade from endogenous phospholipids and shift the inflammatory state to being more anti-inflammatory. Lipid mediators resolvin D1 and protectin D1 all inhibit transendothelial migration of neutrophils, so preventing neutrophilic infiltration at sites of inflammation, resolvin D1 inhibits IL-1Î² production, and protectin D1 inhibits TNF and IL-1Î² production . As a natural ligand, DHA induces a protective effect in retinal tissues by activating retinoid x receptors and subsequent ERK/MAPK signaling pathway in photoreceptors to promote their survival and differentiation, stimulating the expression of antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and preserving mitochondrial membrane potential ."
1278,DB03843,"Use for drying skin before or after surgical removal of warts or where dryness is required. A highly reactive aldehyde gas formed by oxidation or incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons.

1279,DB04209,"It is a quaternary ammonium compound, as it consists of an amphipathic cation with two aminoquinaldinium rings at both ends of a long hydrophobic hydrocarbon chain. It is also used in vaginal tablets to treat bacterial vaginosis._In vitro_, dequalinium possesses antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, yeasts, and protozoa. Dequalinium has a rapid bactericidal and fungicidal action. The bactericidal and fungicidal effects of dequalinium can occur within 30 to 60 minutes. Once in the bacteria, dequalinium denatures proteins involved in the respiratory chain and glycolysis of bacteria, interfering with bacterial cell metabolism and ribosomal protein synthesis."
1280,DB04339,"Carbocisteine is indicated over the counter and in prescription formulas to clear airway secretions in conditions associated with increased mucus.Dyspnea and cough are common symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other respiratory conditions characterized by increased mucus production. Carbocisteine is a mucolytic drug that alleviates respiratory symptoms and infections by reducing the viscosity of mucus, allowing it to be expelled. Increased fucomucins can be found in the mucus of patients with COPD. A study found that L-carbocisteine can inhibit damage to cells by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by activating protein kinase B (Akt) phosphorylation, suggesting that carbocisteine may have antioxidant effects and prevent apoptosis of lung cells. There is some evidence that carbocisteine suppresses NF-ÎºB and ERK1/2 MAPK signalling pathways, reducing TNF-alpha induced inflammation in the lungs, as well as other inflammatory pathways."
1281,DB04570,"Latamoxef is an oxacephem antibiotic usually grouped with the cephalosporins. It is used to treat bacterial infections. Latamoxef  is primarily indicated in conditions like Bone and joint infection, GI infections, Gynecological infections, Meningitis, Respiratory tract infections, Septicaemia, Skin infections, Soft tissue infections, UTI. Latamoxef is a broad- spectrum beta-lactam antibiotic similar in structure to the cephalosporins except for the substitution of an oxaazabicyclo moiety for the thiaazabicyclo moiety of certain cephalosporins. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that amoxicllin interferes with an autolysin inhibitor."
1282,DB04571,"Trioxsalen is a pigmenting photosensitizing agent used in conjunction with ultraviolet light in the treatment of vitiligo.Trioxsalen (trimethylpsoralen, trioxysalen or trisoralen) is a furanocoumarin and a psoralen derivative obtained from several plants, mainly Psoralea corylifolia. Like other psoralens it causes photosensitization of the skin. It is administered either topically or orally in conjunction with UV-A (the least damaging form of ultraviolet light) for phototherapy treatment of vitiligo and hand eczema. The photoactivated form produces interstrand linkages in DNA resulting in cell apoptosis. The compound is has been explored for development of antisense oligonucleotides that can be cross-linked specifically to a mutant mRNA sequence without affecting normal transcripts differing at even a single base pair.Trioxsalen ispharmacologically inactive but when exposed to ultraviolet radiation or sunlight it is converted to its active metabolite to produce a beneficial reaction affecting the diseased tissue.After photoactivation it creates interstrand cross-links in DNA, which can cause programmed cell death."
1283,DB04572,"Also, when high dose chemotherapy with HPCT support it is appropriate for the treatment of solid tumours in adult and paediatric patients.N,N'N'-triethylenethiophosphoramide (ThioTEPA) is a cancer chemotherapeutic member of the alkylating agent group, now in use for over 50 years. It is a stable derivative of N,N',N''- triethylenephosphoramide (TEPA). Its main toxicity is myelosuppression.The unstable nitrogen-carbon groups alkylate with DNA causing irrepairable DNA damage. They stop tumor growth by crosslinking guanine nucleobases in DNA double-helix strands, directly attacking DNA. These drugs act nonspecifically.The alkyl group is attached to the guanine base of DNA, at the number 7 nitrogen atom of the imidazole ring."
1284,DB04573,"Used as a test to determine the general health of an unborn fetus.A hydroxylated metabolite of estradiol or estrone that has a hydroxyl group at C3-beta, 16-alpha, and 17-beta position. Though estriol is used as part of the primarily North American phenomenon of bioidentical hormone replacement therapy, it is not approved for use by the FDA or Health Canada. It is only produced in significant amounts during pregnancy as it is made by the placenta. If levels of ""unconjugated estriol"" are abnormally low in a pregnant woman, this may indicate a problem with the development of the child. The drug interacts with a target cell receptor."
1285,DB04574,"Estropipate is used for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with the monopause, and moderate to severe symptoms of vulval and vaginal atrophy associated with the menopause. It is also used to treat hypoestrogenism due to hypogonadism, castration or primary ovarian failure, and prevent postmenopausal osteoporosis.Estrone sulfate (as estropipate) is a form of estrogen. It has several uses such as: alleviate symptoms of menopause as hormone replacement therapy, treatment some types of infertility, treatment of some conditions leading to underdevelopment of female sexual characteristics, treatment of vaginal atrophy, treatment of some types of breast cancer (particularly in men and postmenopausal women), treatment of prostate cancer and prevention of osteoporosis.Estropipate is an estrogenic substance. It acts as naturally produced estrogen does. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.Estradiol enters target cells freely (e.g., female organs, breasts, hypothalamus, pituitary) and interacts with a target cell receptor."
1286,DB04575,"Used in hormone replacement therapy, treating symptoms of menopause such as hot flashes. Also used to treat breast and prostate cancer.The 3-cyclopentyl ether of ethinyl estradiol.Quinestrol is the 3-cyclopentyl ether of ethinyl estradiol (the active metabolite). Ethinyl estradiol is a synthetic derivative of the natural estrogen estradiol.Estrogens diffuse into their target cells and interact with a protein receptor (the estrogen receptor). Estrogen interacts with a target cell receptor. Estrogens increase the hepatic synthesis of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), thyroid-binding globulin (TBG), and other serum proteins and suppress follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary."
1287,DB04711,"Iodipamide is used as a contrast agent for cholecystography and intravenous cholangiography.Iodipamide is a water-soluble radiographic contrast media for cholecystography and intravenous cholangiography.Following intravenous administration of Cholografin Meglumine, iodipamide is carried to the liver where it is rapidly secreted. The contrast medium appears in the bile within 10 to 15 minutes after injection, thus permitting visualization of the hepatic and common bile ducts, even in cholecystectomized patients. The gallbladder begins to fill within an hour after injection; maximum filling is reached after two to two and one-half hours. The contrast medium is finally eliminated in the feces without passing through the enterohepatic circulation, except for approximately 10 percent of the intravenously administered dose which is excreted through the kidneys.Organic iodine compounds block x-rays as they pass through the body, thereby allowing body structures containing iodine to be delineated in contrast to those structures that do not contain iodine. The degree of opacity produced by these iodinated organic compounds is directly proportional to the total amount (concentration and volume) of the iodinated contrast agent in the path of the x-rays."
1288,DB04743,"For the treatment of acute pain, the symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis and primary dysmenorrhoea in adolescents and adults above 12 years old.Nimesulide is a relatively COX-2 selective, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with analgesic and antipyretic properties. Its approved indications are the treatment of acute pain, the symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis and primary dysmenorrhoea in adolescents and adults above 12 years old. Due to concerns about the risk of hepatotoxicity, nimesulide has been withdrawn from market in many countries.Food, gender and advanced age have negligible effects on nimesulide pharmacokinetics.The therapeutic effects of Nimesulide are the result of its complete mode of action which targets a number of key mediators of the inflammatory process such as: COX-2 mediated prostaglandins, free radicals, proteolytic enzymes and histamine."
1289,DB04794,"It kills fungi and yeasts by interfering with their cell membranes.Bifonazole works by inhibiting the production of a substance called ergosterol, which is an essential component of fungal cell membranes.It acts to destabilize the fungal cyctochrome p450 51 enzyme (also known as Lanosterol 14-alpha demethylase). This is vital in the cell membrance structure of the fungus. Its inhibition leads to cell lysis. As bifonazole causes holes to appear in the cell membranes, essential constituents of the fungal cells can leak out. This kills the fungi."
1290,DB04817,"Metamizole is banned in several countries, where it was previously used as a powerful analgesic and fever reducer. In 1963, metamizole was withdrawn from the Canadian market and banned in the UK, France, Sweden, Norway and Australia. Metamizole is still used in certain countries in Europe, Asia and South America.Metamizole is a strong analgesic and antipyretic with spasmolytic properties. It has weak anti-inflammatory or antithrombotic properties and does not follow the same mechanism of action as conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It has been shown that metamizole-induced agranulocytosis is caused by the development of drug-dependent anti-neutrophil antibodies requiring covalent binding of neutrophils to metamizole and its metabolites.The mechanism of action of metamizole is not fully understood."
1291,DB04824,Used for over a century as a laxative.Phenolphthalein was withdrawn in Canada due to concerns with carcinogenicity in 1997.
1292,DB04832,"For the treatment of depression.Zimelidine has been banned worldwide due to serious, sometimes fatal, cases of central and/or peripheral neuropathy known as Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome and due to a peculiar hypersensitivity reaction involving many organs including skin exanthema, flu-like symptoms, arthralgias, and sometimes eosinophilia. Additionally, zimelidine was charged to cause an increase in suicidal ideation and/or attempts among depressive patients.Zimelidine was the first marketed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant. It is a pyridylallylamine, structurally different from other antidepressants.The antidepressant actions of zimelidine are presumed to be linked to its inhibition of CNS neuronal uptake of serotonin. Zimelidine blocks the reuptake of serotonin at the serotonin reuptake pump of the neuronal membrane, enhancing the actions of serotonin on 5HT1A autoreceptors. SSRIs bind with significantly less affinity to histamine, acetylcholine, and norepinephrine receptors than tricyclic antidepressant drugs."

1296,DB04838,"Used in the treatment of various blood vessel diseases (e.g., claudication, arteriosclerosis and Raynaud's disease) and nighttime leg cramps.A direct-acting smooth muscle relaxant used to dilate blood vessels. It may cause gastrointestinal distress and tachycardia. Cyclandelate is not approved for use in the U.S. or Canada, but is approved in various European countries.Cyclandelate is in a class of drugs called vasodilators. Cyclandelate relaxes veins and arteries, which makes them wider and allows blood to pass through them more easily.Cyclandelate produces peripheral vasodilation by a direct effect on vascular smooth muscle. Pharmacological action may be due to calcium-channel antagonism."
1297,DB04839,"For the palliative treatment of patients with advanced prostatic carcinoma.An anti-androgen that, in the form of its acetate (cyproterone acetate), also has progestational properties. It is used in the treatment of hypersexuality in males, as a palliative in prostatic carcinoma, and, in combination with estrogen, for the therapy of severe acne and hirsutism in females.Cyproterone is an antiandrogen. It suppresses the actions of testosterone (and its metabolite dihydrotestosterone) on tissues. It acts by blocking androgen receptors which prevents androgens from binding to them and suppresses luteinizing hormone (which in turn reduces testosterone levels).The direct antiandrogenic effect of cyproterone is blockage of the binding of dihydrotestosterone to the specific receptors in the prostatic carcinoma cell. In addition, cyproterone exerts a negative feed-back on the hypothalamo-pituitary axis, by inhibiting the secretion of luteinizing hormone resulting in diminished production of testicular testosterone."
1298,DB04840,"They are commonly referred to as having a debrisoquin 4-hydroxylase polymorphism.Debrisoquin is an adrenergic neuron-blocking drug similar in effects to guanethidine. It is a substrate for a polymorphic cytochrome P-450 enzyme. This leads to a gradual depletion of NE stores in the nerve endings. Once inside the terminal it blocks the release of noradrenaline in response to arrival of an action potential. In contrast to ganglionic blocking agents, debrisoquin suppresses equally the responses mediated by alpha-and beta-adrenergic receptors but does not produce parasympathetic blockade."

It is effective in the prophylaxis of migraine, occlusive peripheral vascular disease, vertigo of central and peripheral origin, and as an adjuvant in the therapy of epilepsy.Flunarizine is a selective calcium entry blocker with calmodulin binding properties and histamine H1 blocking activity.Flunarizine inhibits the influx of extracellular calcium through myocardial and vascular membrane pores by physically plugging the channel. The decrease in intracellular calcium inhibits the contractile processes of smooth muscle cells, causing dilation of the coronary and systemic arteries, increased oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue, decreased total peripheral resistance, decreased systemic blood pressure, and decreased afterload."
1300,DB04842,"Used for the treatment of schizophrenia.A long-acting injectable antipsychotic agent used for chronic schizophrenia.Fluspirilene is a relatively long-acting injectable depot antipsychotic drug used for schizophrenia. Fluspirilene does not differ greatly from other depot antipsychotics (fluphenazine decanoate, fluphenazine enathate, perphenazine onanthat, pipotiazine undecylenate) with respect to treatment efficacy, response or tolerability. Outcomes suggest that fluspirilene does not differ significantly from oral antipsychotics or in different weekly regimens, although much cannot be inferred because of the shortage of trials."
1301,DB04843,"Mepenzolate is a post-ganglionic parasympathetic inhibitor. It decreases gastric acid and pepsin secretion and suppresses spontaneous contractions of the colon. Pharmacologically, it is a post-ganglionic parasympathetic inhibitor. It has not been shown to be effective in contributing to the healing of peptic ulcer, decreasing the rate of recurrence, or preventing complications.Mepenzolate diminishes gastric acid and pepsin secretion. This leads to decreases in gastric acid and pepsin secretion and suppression of spontaneous contractions of the colon."
1302,DB04844,"It is a monoamine depletor and used as symptomatic treatment of chorea associated with Huntington's disease. FDA approved on August 15, 2008.Prolongation of the QTc interval has been observed at doses of 50 mg. In rats, it has been observed that tetrabenazine or its metabolites bind to melanin-containing tissues such as the eyes and skin. After a single oral dose of radiolabeled tetrabenazine, radioactivity was still detected in eye and fur at 21 days post dosing. Tetrabenazine is a reversible human vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 inhibitor (Ki = 100 nM)."
1303,DB04845,"Investigated for use/treatment in breast cancer, head and neck cancer, melanoma, lung cancer, lymphoma (non-hodgkin's), prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and cancer/tumors (unspecified).Ixabepilone is an epothilone B analog developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb as a cancer drug. Ixabepilone is administered through injection, and will be marketed under the trade name Ixempra. It has a lactoneâlactam modification that minimizes susceptibility to esterase degradation.Binding of Ixabepilone to beta-tubulins (e.g. beta-III tubulin) stabilizes microtubules. Microtubules are essential to cell division, and epothilones therefore stop cells from properly dividing. Like taxol, Ixabepilone binds to the Î±Î²-tubulin heterodimer subunit."
1304,DB04846,"This study demonstrated decreased incidence of arterial rupture or dissection (a specific type of arterial rupture in which the layers of the vessel separate prior to complete failure of the artery wall). Celiprolol is not approved for use by the FDA in the treatment of vascular EhlersâDanlos syndrome.Celiprolol is a vasoactive beta-1 selective adrenoceptor antagonist with partial beta-2 agonist activity. The beta-2 agonist activity is thought to account for its mild vasodilating properties. It lowers blood pressure in hypertensive patients at rest and on exercise. Under conditions of stress such as exercise, celiprolol attenuates chronotropic and inotropic responses to sympathetic stimulation."
1305,DB04847,"Roxadustat is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with symptomatic anemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD).Roxadustat is a first-in-class hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor used to treat anemia associated with chronic kidney disease. It works by reducing the breakdown of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), which is a transcription factor that stimulates red blood cell production in response to low oxygen levels. Roxadustat was first approved by the European Commission in August 2021.Roxadustat dose-dependently improves iron bioavailability, increases hemoglobin production, and increases red blood cell mass in patients with anemia. Roxadustat is a reversible and potent inhibitor of HIF-PHD enzymes: inhibition of HIF-PHD leads to the accumulation of functional HIF, an increase in plasma endogenous EPO production, enhanced erythropoiesis, and indirect suppression of hepcidin, which is an iron regulator protein that is increased during inflammation in chronic kidney disease. Roxadustat can also regulate iron transporter proteins  and regulates iron metabolism by increasing serum transferrin, intestinal iron absorption and the release of stored iron in patients with anemia associated with dialysis-dependent or dialysis-independent CKD."
1306,DB04854,"Febuxostat is indicated for the chronic management of hyperuricemia in adult patients with gout who have an inadequate response to a maximally titrated dose of , who are intolerant to allopurinol, or for whom treatment with allopurinol is not advisable. Febuxostat works by inhibiting the activity of an enzyme that is responsible for the synthesis of uric acid, thereby reducing serum uric acid levels. Xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) can act as a xanthine oxidase or xanthine dehydrogenase. In humans, it is a critical enzyme for uric acid production as it catalyzes the oxidation reaction steps from hypoxanthine to xanthine and from xanthine to uric acid in the pathway of purine metabolism. As febuxostat can inhibit both forms of XOR, it can inhibit ROS formation, oxidative stress, and inflammation."
1307,DB04855,"Dronedarone is indicated for the management of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients in sinus rhythm with a history of paroxysmal or persistent AF to reduce the risk of hospitalization.Dronedarone is a Class III antiarrhythmic drug that works to restore the normal sinus rhythm in patients with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation. A safety concern for the risk of drug-induced hepatocellular injury has been issued following marketing of dronedarone.Dronedarone is an antiarrhythmic agent that restores normal sinus rhythm and reduces heart rate in atrial fibrillation. The treatment of dronedarone in patients with severe heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction was associated with increased early mortality related to the worsening of heart failure. Compared to its related compound , dronedarone has a faster onset and offset of actions with a shorter elimination half-life and low tissue accumulation.Atrial fibrillation is the most common type of arrhythmia that is caused by abnormal electrical activity in the atria. Dronedarone achieves heart rate and rhythm control in atrial fibrillation."
1308,DB04861,"Nebivolol and other beta blockers are generally not first line therapies as many patients are first treated with thiazide diuretics. Nebivolol was granted FDA approval on 17 December 2007.Nebivolol is a selective beta-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist that decreases vascular resistance, increases stroke volume and cardiac output, and does not negatively affect left ventricular function. Diabetic patients should monitor their blood glucose levels as beta blockers may mask signs of hypoglycemia.Nebivolol is a highly selective beta-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist with weak beta-2 adrenergic receptor antagonist activity. Nebivolol also inhibits aldosterone, and beta-1 antagonism in the juxtaglomerular apparatus also inhibits the release of renin. Decreased aldosterone leads to decreased blood volume, and decreased renin leads to reduced vasoconstriction."
1309,DB04864,"Investigated for use/treatment in alzheimer's disease.Huperzine A, is a naturally occurring sesquiterpene alkaloid found in the extracts of the firmoss _Huperzia serrata_.

1313,DB04876,"By inhibiting DPP-4, vildagliptin prevents the degradation of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), which are incretin hormones that promote insulin secretion and regulate blood glucose levels. Vildagliptin is currently under investigation in the US.Vildagliptin works to improve glycemic control in type II diabetes mellitus by enhancing the glucose sensitivity of beta-cells (Î²-cells) in pancreatic islets and promoting glucose-dependent insulin secretion. Vildagliptin causes an increase in the insulin to glucagon ratio by increasing incretin hormone levels: this results in a decrease in fasting and postprandial hepatic glucose production. It also has no effects on insulin secretion or blood glucose levels in individuals with normal glycemic control. It enhances the glucose sensitivity of alpha- and beta-cells and augments glucose-dependent insulin secretion."

1316,DB04895,"Pegatinib aids neovascular age-related macular degeneration by binding to VEGF which in order reduces angiogenesis and vessel permeability. VEGF is a secreted protein that selectively binds and activates its receptors located primarily on the surface of vascular endothelial cells. VEGF induces angiogenesis, and increases vascular permeability and inflammation, all of which are thought to contribute to the progression of the neovascular (wet) form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of blindness. VEGF-A, in patients with wet AMD, also increases vascular permeability and inflammation in the eye, leading to progression of the condition. Pegaptanib is a pegylated oligonucleotide that selectively binds VEGF165, the isoform most responsible for VEGF-A's pathological action in wet AMD."
1317,DB04896,"Nevertheless, it is important to note that the regulatory approval of and/or indications listed here for milnacipran may or may not exist and/or vary greatly between regions and nations .Milnacipran is a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) and like many agents in this category was originally developed for and continues to be approved and indicated for the treatment of depression . Levomilnacipran has no significant affinity for Ca++, K+, Na+, and Clâ channels and does not inhibit the activity of human monoamine oxidases (MAO-A and MAO-B) or acetylcholinesterase . Alternatively, a supratherapeutic dose of 300 mg/day is capable of causing a maximum mean difference in heart rate from placebo of 22.1 bpm and a mean difference in systolic and diastolic blood pressure from placebo ranging from 5.4 to 7.9 mmHg and 7.9 to 10.6 mmHg, respectively .The dual ability for milnacipran to inhibit the reuptake of both serotonin (5HT) and norepinephrine (NE) facilitates its treatment of both fibromyalgia and major depressive disorder (MDD). In particular, it is generally believed that 5HT and NE participate in the modulation of endogenous analgesic mechanisms by way of the descending inhibitory pain pathways in the brain and spinal cord . Such NE pain mitigation is consequently also enhanced by milnacipran's ability to enhance the presence of NE by inhibiting its reuptake via norepinephrine transporters at synaptic clefts ."

1320,DB04899,"For the intravenous treatment of patients with acutely decompensated congestive heart failure who have dyspnea at rest or with minimal activity.Nesiritide is a medication used to treat acutely decompensated congestive heart failure with dyspnea at rest or with minimal exertion (such as talk, eating or bathing). Nesiritide is a 32 amino acid recombinant human B-type natriuretic peptide.Nesiritide works by facilitating cardiovascular homeostasis through the negative regulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. This regulation will in order stimulate cyclic guanosine monophosphate and smooth muscle cell relaxation. In simpler terms, it promotes vasodilation, natriuresis, and diuresis.Human BNP binds to the particulate guanylate cyclase receptor of vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells, leading to increased intracellular concentrations of guanosine 3'5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) and smooth muscle cell relaxation. The effect of nesiritide on vascular permeability has not been studied."
1321,DB04908,"Flibanserin is the first drug to be approved for hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in premenopausal women by the FDA in August 2015. It was originally developed as an antidepressant medication by Boehringer Ingelheim, but showed lack of efficacy in trials and was further developed as a hypoactive sexual disorder drug by Sprout Pharmaceuticals. Flibanserin's mechanism of action is attributed to its high affinity for 5-HTA1 and 5-HTA2 receptors, displaying agonist activity on 5-HTA1 and antagonist on 5-HTA2, resulting in lowering of serotonin in the brain as well as an effect on increasing norepinephrine and dopamine neurotransmitters.Flibansetrin has high affinity for serotonin receptors in the brain: it acts as an agonist on 5-HT1A and an antagonist on 5-HT2A. In vivo, flibanserin binds equally to 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors. Its action on neurotransmitter receptors may contribute to reduction in serotonin levels and increase in dopamine and norepinephrine levels, all of which may play part in reward processing."
1322,DB04911,"It is used for confirmed/suspected infections with designated and susceptible gram-positive organisms. Oritavancin was initially approved by the FDA in 2014 and formulated to combat susceptible gram-positive bacteria that cause skin and skin structure infections. On March 12, 2021 the FDA approved Kimyrsa, a complete course of therapy in a single, 1 hour 1200 mg infusion. Marketed by Melinta Therapeutics, Kimyrsa offers effective and time-efficient treatment for skin and skin structure infections.Oritavancin interferes with bacterial cell wall synthesis and integrity, treating susceptible skin and subcutaneous tissue infections with gram-positive bacteria. Finally, this drug also acts by disrupting the bacterial cell membrane, interfering with its integrity, which eventually leads to cell death by various mechanisms."
1323,DB04918,"It was discovered by Basilea Pharmaceutica and is being developed by Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research and Development. Ceftobiprole is the first cephalosporin to demonstrate clinical efficacy in patients with infections due to methicillin-resistant staphylococci and, if approved by regulatory authorities, is expected to be a useful addition to the armamentarium of agents for the treatment of complicated skin infections and pneumonia.Ceftobiprole, a cephalosporin antibiotic, is active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.Cephalosporins, such as ceftobiprole, are bactericidal and have the same mode of action as other beta-lactam antibiotics (such as penicillins). Cephalosporins disrupt the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer of bacterial cell walls. The peptidoglycan layer is important for cell wall structural integrity, especially in Gram-positive organisms. The final transpeptidation step in the synthesis of the peptidoglycan is facilitated by transpeptidases known as penicillin binding proteins (PBPs)."
1324,DB04920,"For the reduction of blood pressure when when oral antihypertensive therapy is not feasible or not desirable.Clevidipine is a dihydropyridine L-type calcium channel blocker that is selective for vascular smooth muscle and is indicated for blood pressure reduction when oral therapy is not an option.Clevidipine belongs to a well-known class of drugs called dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists. Clevidpine is the first third generation intravenous dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. In vitro studies demonstrated that clevidipine acts by selectively relaxing the smooth muscle cells that line small arteries, resulting in arterial dilation, widening of the artery opening, and without reducing central venous pressure or reducing cardiac output.Possibly by deforming the channel, inhibiting ion-control gating mechanisms, and/or interfering with the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, clevidipine inhibits the influx of extracellular calcium across both the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes. The resultant inhibition of the contractile processes of the myocardial smooth muscle cells leads to dilation of the coronary and systemic arteries and improved oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue."

1329,DB04948,"Lofexidine is indicated for mitigation of symptoms associated with acute withdrawal from opioids and for facilitation of the completion of opioid discontinuation treatment. These symptoms are often observed after abrupt reductions in the opioid dose and can be resolved by re-administration of the opioid.Lofexidine is a non-opioid centrally acting alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonist that was first approved for the treatment of opioid withdrawal in the United Kingdom in 1992. Lofexidine was developed by US Woldmeds LLC and it was approved by the FDA on May 16, 2018.In clinical trials, lofexidine presented more severe opioid withdrawal effects than observed with methadone. Therefore, chronic opioid use translates into an exacerbated production of cAMP and norepinephrine release. This effect is performed without interacting with opioid receptors which mediate other activities of opioid dependence or addiction."
1330,DB04951,"In Canada and Europe, it is approved in adults only.Pirfenidone is a synthetic pyridone drug. It is an antifibrotic agent with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties  that is used to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), which is a chronic, progressive form of interstitial pneumonia. It may improve lung function and reduce the number of acute exacerbations in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).The exact mechanism of action of pirfenidone is not fully understood. Pirfenidone attenuates the production of transforming growth factor-Î²1 (TGF-Î²1), a key profibrotic and pro-inflammatory cytokine implicated in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). By suppressing TGF-Î²1, pirfenidone inhibits TGF-Î²1-induced differentiation of human lung fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, thereby preventing excess collagen synthesis and extracellular matrix production."
1331,DB04953,"It is a neuronal potassium channel opener being developed as a first-in-class antiepileptic drug (AED) and is currently being studied in Phase 3 trials as an adjunctive treatment for partial-onset seizures in adult patients with refractory epilepsy. Ezogabine is highly efficacious in a broad-spectrum of in vivo epilepsy and seizure models. A comparison of antiepileptic form activity of ezogabine with that of conventional anticonvulsants in in vitro models suggests that retigabine is especially likely to be useful in the treatment of pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Thus, retigabine may prove to be useful in the treatment of a diverse range of disease states in which neuronal hyperexcitability is a common underlying factor.Ezogabine has a novel mechanism of action that involves opening of neuronal Kv7.2-7.5 (formerly KCNQ2-5) voltage activated potassium channels. In addition to acting on potassium ion channels, retigabine also affects GABA neurotransmission in the GABA-A receptor, which is a key inhibitory receptor in the central nervous system and is implicated in epilepsy."

More specifically, ataluren is used in the small group of patients whose disease is caused by a specific genetic defect (called a ânonsense mutationâ) in the dystrophin gene.Ataluren is a novel, orally administered drug that targets nonsense mutations. Ataluren is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency to treat Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy in patients aged 5 years and older who are able to walk. This drug does not yet have approval by the US Food and Drug Administration or by Health Canada for any indications.Ataluren enables ribosomal readthrough of mRNA containing premature stop codons that otherwise would result in premature termination of protein chains. The research on the effects of Ataluren on the translation and stability of nonsense-containing mRNA in vitor show that Ataluren promoted readthrough at each of the nonsense codons, showing maximal activity with UGA, while having no effect on mRNA levels."
1334,DB05018,"Migalastat is approved by the FDA for the treatment of adults with a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease and an amenable galactosidase alpha gene (GLA) variant based on in vitro assay data. Migalastat (approved and sold under Amicus Therapeutics' brand name Galafold) is subsequently an oral pharmacological chaperone of alpha-Gal A for the treatment of Fabry disease in adults who have amenable GLA variants. Given the rarity of Fabry disease and the proportion of Fabry disease patients that could benefit from migalastat therapy, Amicus Therapeutics' brand name Galafold was approved using the Accelerated Approval pathway, under which the FDA may approve drugs for serious conditions where there is an unmet medical need and where a drug is shown to have certain effects that are reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit to patients. The in vitro assay did not evaluate the trafficking of the mutant alpha-Gal A proteins into the lysosome or the dissociation of migalastat from the mutant alpha-Gal A proteins within the lysosome. Fabry disease-causing mutations occur in the galactosidase alpha (GLA) gene and result in a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-Gal A) that is required for glycosphingolipid substrate (GL-3 and lyso-Gb3) metabolism ."
1335,DB05039,"Indacaterol is a novel, ultra-long-acting, rapid onset Î²(2)-adrenoceptor agonist developed for Novartis for the once-daily management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Indacaterol is also a chiral molecule but only the pure R-enantiomer is dispensed.Bronchodilator drugs are the foundation for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Otherwise, the drug's safety profile was similar to that of other bronchodilators. Indacaterol works by stimulating adrenergic beta-2 receptors in the smooth muscle of the airways. In vitro studies have shown that indacaterol has more than 24-fold greater agonist activity at beta2-receptors compared to beta1-receptors and 20-fold greater agonist activity compared to beta3-receptors."
1336,DB05084,"Abaloparatide is also indicated to increase bone density in men with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture (defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture or multiple risk factors for fracture) or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.Abaloparatide is an N-terminal analog of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP)  and an agonist at the parathyroid hormone type 1 (PTH1) receptor. It was first approved by the FDA on April 28, 2017, for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and is also used to increase bone density in men with osteoporosis. In rats and monkeys, abaloparatide exerted anabolic effects, increasing bone mineral density and mineral content correlating with increases in bone strength at vertebral and nonvertebral sites.Abaloparatide is an agonist at the PTH1 receptor (PTH1R), a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that regulates bone formation and bone turnover, as well as mineral ion homeostasis. The R0 conformation is a G proteinâindependent high-affinity conformation, and upon binding, the ligand induces a longer-lasting signalling response that gradually increases cAMP. Abaloparatide binds to the RG conformation with greater selectivity: it induces more transient signalling responses and favours net bone formation over bone resorption."
1337,DB05087,"It was approved under the brand name ZTALMY by the US FDA in March 2022 for the treatment of seizures associated with CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD), becoming the first FDA-approved treatment indicated specifically for CDD. In July 2023, ganaxolone was also approved under the same brand name and for the same indication by the EMA.Ganaxolone - like other neurosteroids - lacks classical hormonal activity, and instead appears to exert its effects directly via modulation of GABAA receptors. In addition, antiepileptic drugs may increase the risk of suicidal behaviour and ideation, although this risk has not been documented directly in patients taking ganaxolone. By enhancing the inhibitory effects of GABAA receptors, endogenous and exogenous neurosteroids have been associated with anxiolytic, sedative, and anticonvulsant effects, amongst others. While the precise mechanism of action of ganaxolone in the treatment of seizures associated with CDD is unknown, its anticonvulsant effects are likely due to positive allosteric GABAA modulation"
1338,DB05099,"In January 2005, the U.S. FDA granted a 'fast-track status' for investigation of ancrod use in patients suffering from acute ischemic stroke, a life threatening condition caused by the blockage of blood vessels supplying blood and oxygen to portions of the brain, for which phase III trials are currently being conducted.The decreased viscosity is directly attributable to lowered fibrinogen levels and leads to important improvements in blood flow and perfusion of the microcirculation. Ancrod decreases the blood viscosity in affected arteries, leads to less intense pain, improves physical limb mobility, facilitates physical and ergo therapy, and decreases the likelihood of local thrombotic events.Ancrod's anticoagulant effects are through the rapid removal of fibrinogen from the blood within hours following ancrod administration. These ancrod-induced microthrombi are friable, unstable, urea-soluble and have significantly degraded a-chains. They do not cross-link to form thrombi. Ancrod does not activate Factor XIII, produce platelet aggregation, or release ADP, ATP, potassium, or serotonin from platelets."
1339,DB05109,"Approved for orphan drug status by the U.S. FDA for treatment of soft tissue sarcomas and ovarian cancer. It is approved for use in Europe, Russia and South Korea for the treatment of advanced soft tissue sarcoma. On October 23, 2015, the FDA approved trabectedin, (as Yondelis), for the treatment of specific soft tissue sarcomas.Two of the rings in the drug's structure allows it to covalently bind to the minor groove of DNA. This has the additive effect of blocking cell division at the G2 phase.Trabectedin interacts with the minor groove of DNA and alkylates guanine at the N2 position, which bends towards the major groove. The agent is also thought to interfere with the nucleotide excision repair pathways of cancer cells, suggesting that it could be effective in the treatment of many cancer types including melanoma and sarcoma, as well as lung, breast, ovarian, endometrial and prostate cancers; clinical evaluations are underway in these indications."
1340,DB05154,"Unlike other therapeutic regimens for the treatment of resistant TB, which may take 18 months or longer and may not be effective, the pretomanid-containing regimen allows for a more efficacious and shorter duration of treatment with fewer drugs.Pretomanid kills the actively replicating bacteria causing tuberculosis, known as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and shortens the duration of treatment in patients who suffer from resistant forms of pulmonary TB by killing dormant bacteria. A decrease in the frequency of TB relapses at 2 and 3 months after treatment was observed after the administration of this regimen, when compared to the administration of a 2-drug regimen. Caution must be observed during the administration of this drug.Pretomanid is a prodrug which is metabolically activated by a nitroreductase enzyme, known as Ddn, producing various active metabolites that are responsible for its other therapeutic actions, particularly the induction of nitric oxide. The formation of this derivative leads to increased levels of nitric oxide, leading to bactericidal activities under anaerobic conditions via its action as a bacterial respiratory poison. The molecular mechanism of the above bactericidal effects is poorly understood at this time, but may involve effects exerted on various genes that affect the cell wall, including the fasI and fasII as well as the efpA and iniBAC operons."
1341,DB05219,"This non-steroidal agent is efficacious in improving disease severity, reducing the risk of infection and reducing the signs and symptoms in patients 2 years old and older. It reduces the local inflammation in the skin and prevents further exacerbation of the disease with a good safety profile. Its structure contains a boron atom, which facilitates skin penetration and binding to the bimetal center of the phosphodiesterase 4 enzyme. It is currently under development as topical treatment of psoriasis.Crisaborole has broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory activity by mainly targeting phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) enzyme that is a key regulator of inflammatory cytokine production. As this enzyme is expressed in keratinocytes and immune cells, crisaborole mediates an anti-inflammatory effect on almost all inflammatory cells."
1342,DB05239,"Cobimetinib is indicated in combination with  for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation. It has been approved in Switzerland and the US, in combination with vemurafenib for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma.Cobimetinib is a reversible inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2. BRAF-inhibitor-resistant tumor cells are sensitive to MEK inhibition, therefore cobimetinib and vemurafenib will result in dual inhibition of BRAF and its downstream target, MEK.Cobimetinib is a reversible inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2. In mice implanted with tumor cell lines expressing BRAF V600E, cobimetinib inhibited tumor cell growth. Cobimetinib and vemurafenib target two different kinases in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway."
1343,DB05245,"Indicated as an adjunct for the prevention and treatment of wound sepsis in patients with second- and third-degree burns.Silver sulfadiazine is a sulfa derivative topical antibacterial used primarily on second- and third-degree burns.Silver sulfadiazine has broad antimicrobial activity. Silver sulfadiazine is not a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and may be useful in situations where such agents are contraindicated.Studies utilizing radioactive micronized silver sulfadiazine, electron microscopy, and biochemical techniques have revealed that the mechanism of action of silver sulfadiazine on bacteria differs from silver nitrate and sodium sulfadiazine. A specific mechanism of action has not been determined, but silver sulfadiazine's effectiveness may possibly be from a synergistic interaction, or the action of each component. Silver ions bind to nucleophilic amino acids, as well as sulfhydryl, amino, imidazole, phosphate, and carboxyl groups in proteins, causing protein denaturation and enzyme inhibition. Silver binds to surface membranes and proteins, causing proton leaks in the membrane, leading to cell death."
1344,DB05246,"For the control of absence (petit mal) seizures that are refractory to other drugs.Mesuximide (or methsuximide) is an anticonvulsant medication. It is sold by Pfizer under the name Petinutin.Used in the treatment of epilepsy. Methsuximide suppresses the paroxysmal three cycle per second spike and wave activity associated with lapses of consciousness which is common in absence (petit mal) seizures. The frequency of epileptiform attacks is reduced, apparently by depression of the motor cortex and elevation of the threshold of the central nervous system to convulsive stimuli.Binds to T-type voltage sensitive calcium channels. Voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) mediate the entry of calcium ions into excitable cells and are also involved in a variety of calcium-dependent processes, including muscle contraction, hormone or neurotransmitter release, gene expression, cell motility, cell division and cell death."
1345,DB05259,"However, the opposite was observed. Along with , , and , glatiramer acetate is a first-line drug for patients with MS. This drug is indicated for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS) due to its ability to modify immune processes involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. Also, it has been suggested that the myelin basic protein (MBP), a myelin autoantigen, plays a role in the development of MS.    Several mechanisms of action have been proposed. It has also been suggested that glatiramer acetate induces the production of T-regulatory cells associated with the suppression of MS, such as CD4+, CD8+ and CD4+CD25+ cells."
1346,DB05260,"It was previously used in the treatment of cancer-related hypercalcemia.Gallium nitrate is a nitrate salt of , a heavy metal that has been used as a diagnostic agent. Gallium nitrate is reported to possess antiresorptive and hypocalcemic effects on bone. Although _in vitro_ and animal studies have been performed to investigate the mechanism of action of gallium nitrate, the precise mechanism for inhibiting calcium resorption has not been determined. Gallium, the active component that exerts the physiological effects of gallium nitrate, may induce physicochemical changes in the bone matrix to promote hydroxyapatite crystallization and attenuate mineral dissolution. Gallium may also decrease acid secretion by osteoclasts  and modulate the synthesis of osteocalcin, an osteoblast-specific bone matrix protein that triggers bone resorption."

Dexlansoprazole inhibits the final step in gastric acid production by blocking the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme.Dexlansoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that suppresses both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion. PPIs are associated with a risk for a rebound effect and a short-term increase in hypersecretion; thus, such risk cannot be excluded with dexlansoprazole. Increased CgA levels may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumours. It inhibits the H/K ATPase at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell, which is involved in the secretion of hydrochloric acid."
1354,DB05381,"It is a powerful stimulant of gastric secretion, a constrictor of bronchial smooth muscle, a vasodilator, and also a centrally acting neurotransmitter.Histamine stimulates gastric gland secretion, causing an increased secretion of gastric juice of high acidity. Capillary dilatation may produce flushing of the face, a decrease in systemic blood pressure, and gastric gland secretion, causing an increased secretion of gastric juice of high acidity. In addition, histamine has a direct stimulant action on smooth muscle, producing contraction if H 1-receptors are activated, or mostly relaxation if H 2-receptors are activated. Also in humans, the stimulant effect of histamine may cause contraction of the intestinal muscle. However, little effect is noticed on the uterus, bladder, or gallbladder."
1355,DB05467,"It first garnered interest as a potential treatment for emphysema but was eventually recognized as a potential novel therapy for patients with FOP. Palovarotene was approved for use in Canada in January 2022 for the management of heterotopic ossification (HO) in patients with FOP, representing the first global approval for any FOP therapy. As with other retinoids, palovarotene can cause birth defects, and it should not be used by patients who are, or intend to become, pregnant. The pathogenesis of FOP is driven by a gain-of-function mutation in the _ACVR1/ALK2_ gene encoding activin A receptor type 1 (ACVR1)/activin-like kinase 2 (ALK2), a bone morphogenetic protein type 1 receptor (BMPR-I). The sustained and aberrant signalling caused by the gain-of-function mutation in _ACVR1/ALK2_ results in overactivation of the downstream SMAD1/5/8 signalling pathway, which in turn is thought to trigger the formation of ectopic chondrogenesis, osteogenesis, and joint fusion characteristic of FOP."

By binding to VEGFR2, ramucirumab prevents binding of its ligands (VEGF-A, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D), thereby preventing VEGF-stimulated receptor phosphorylation and downstream ligand-induced proliferation, permeability, and migration of human endothelial cells. VEGFR stimulation also mediates downstream signalling required for angiogenesis and is postulated to be heavily involved in cancer progression, making it a highly likely drug target. In contrast to other agents directed against VEGFR-2, ramucirumab binds a specific epitope on the extracellular domain of VEGFR-2, thereby blocking all VEGF ligands from binding to it."

1361,DB05676,"Apremilast is indicated for the treatment of adults with active psoriatic arthritis and adults with oral ulcers associated with Behcet's Disease. In July 2019, apremilast was granted a new FDA approval for the treatment of oral ulcers associated with Behcet's disease, an autoimmune condition that causes recurrent skin, blood vessel, and central nervous system inflammation.Apremilast reduces but does not completely inhibit various inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1Î±, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 MCP-1, MIP-1Î², MMP-3, and TNF-Î±, relieving the symptoms of psoriasis and Behcet's disease, which are caused by an increase in these inflammatory mediators. The need for apremilast should be carefully assessed along with the risk of worsening depression and suicide. If weight loss occurs, the degree of weight loss should be evaluated, and consideration should be made for the possible discontinuation of apremilast.The full mechanism of action of this drug is not fully established, however, it is known that apremilast is an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), which mediates the activity of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a second messenger. The above inflammatory mediators have been implicated in various psoriatic conditions as well as Behcet's disease, leading to their undesirable inflammatory symptoms such as mouth ulcers, skin lesions, and arthritis."

Together MCC and DM1 are called emtansine and are produced by chemical synthesis."
1364,DB05812,"In Canada, it is used in patients who have received prior chemotherapy containing  after the failure of androgen deprivation therapy. In Canada, this combination product is also used with  and is reserved for patients who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, and in whom chemotherapy is not clinically indicated.Abiraterone is a potent, irreversible, and selective inhibitor of 17 Î±hydroxylase/C17,20-lyase (CYP17), an enzyme expressed in testicular, adrenal, and prostatic tumour tissues, to regulate androgen biosynthesis. As abiraterone has poor oral bioavailability and is susceptible to hydrolysis by esterases, abiraterone acetate was developed as an orally bioavailable prodrug with enhanced stability and absorption._In vivo_, abiraterone acetate is rapidly hydrolyzed to abiraterone, which mediates its pharmacological actions. Abiraterone decreases serum testosterone and other androgens. Androgen deprivation therapies, such as treatment with GnRH agonists or orchiectomy, decrease androgen production in the testes but do not affect androgen production by the adrenals or in the tumour."
1365,DB05829,"For use/treatment in osteoporosis.Parathyroid hormone (PTH)  is a single-chain polypeptide composed of 84 amino acids. Available as Preotact, it is an identical form of human recombinant hormome which produced as a fusion protein undergoeing post-translational processing involving the cleavage of the OmpA leader sequence, leaving the mature protein as a single-chain 84 amino-acids polypeptide (9.4 kDa). This is achieved by the acute effects of the hormone on calcium resorption in bone and calcium reabsorption in the kidney. Parathyroid hormone also stimulates calcium absorption in the intestine, this being mediated indirectly by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Thus, a hypocalcemic stimulus of parathyroid hormone secretion results in an increased influx of calcium from three sources (bone, kidney, and intestine), resulting in a normalization of the serum calcium concentration without change in the serum phosphate concentration.The biological actions of rhPTH are mediated through binding to at least two distinct high- affinity cell-surface receptors specific for the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the molecule, both of which are required for normal bone metabolism. The N-terminal portion of the molecule is primarily responsible for the bone building effects of parathyroid hormone."

Obeticholic acid is currently being considered for FDA approval to treat fibrosis caused by non-alcoholic liver steatohepatitis (NASH), and is likely to be approved for this indication in 2020.Primary biliary cirrhosis, or PBC, is a progressive and chronic condition that leads to hepatic injury often resulting in end-stage liver failure that requires liver transplantation. Obeticholic acid is a farnesoid-X receptor (FXR) agonist used to treat this condition, possibly allowing for increased survival. In 2016, it was granted approval to treat primary biliary cholangitis in combination with , which was previously the mainstay treatment for this condition. Primary biliary cirrhosis is an autoimmune process by which the bile ducts and liver are damaged progressively, leading to fibrosis and cirrhosis."
1368,DB06016,"It is also indicated to monotherapy for acute management of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (**bipolar mania**) in adults, and acute management of depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (**bipolar depression**) in adults.Cariprazine is an atypical antipsychotic agent and a piperazine derivative that was first developed in Hungary. In clinical trials, it reduced positive and negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and acute mania in patients with bipolar I disorder. While recent research points to the involvement of multiple neurotransmitters in the development and maintenance of schizophrenia and bipolar disorders, the dopamine hypothesis has been and continues to be a key theory in understanding the pathophysiology of these psychiatric disorders. For example, hyperactive dopamine D2 receptor activity has been associated with positive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hallucinations and delusions. It was stated that hyperdopaminergia, caused by elevations in D2/3 receptor availability and a hyperactive reward processing network, underlies the development of mania in bipolar disorder."
1369,DB06043,"Olaratumab (IMC-3G3) is a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody with antitumor activity that selectively binds the external domain of human platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-Î± with high affinity and blocks ligand binding. Olaratumab antibody binding leads to inhibition of ligand-dependent signaling in PDGFR(alpha)-expressing tumor cells, as well as stromal cells in the tumor microenviroment that are dependent on PDGFR(alpha) signaling. Olaratumab blocks ligand-induced tumor cell proliferation, and inhibits receptor autophosphorylation and ligand-induced phosphorylation of the downstream signaling molecules protein kinase B (Akt) and mitogen-activated protein kinase . PDGFR signalling is a type of tyrosine kinase-mediated pathway that normally regulates cell growth, chemotaxis, and mesenchymal stem cell differentiation. It also promotes internalization of PDGFR thus alters the surface levels of PDGFR."
1370,DB06045,"Trofinetide is indicated for the treatment of Rett syndrome in adults and pediatric patients two years of age and older.Trofinetide is a novel synthetic analog of , also known as glycineâprolineâglutamate (GPE), a naturally occurring protein in the brain and the N-terminal tripeptide of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Trofinetide is believed to work by reducing inflammation and apoptosis of neurons.Trofinetide works to reduce and alleviate the symptoms of Rett syndrome. GPE exhibits neuroprotective properties: it protects neurons from glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity and oxidative stress at nanomolar concentrations. With a longer half-life than GPE, trofinetide is believed to exhibit similar neuroprotective properties.Most cases of Rett syndrome are associated with loss-of-function mutations in a gene encoding methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2), a DNA binding protein with a role in epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Rett syndrome more commonly occurs in girls than boys."
1371,DB06077,"It is also approved for the treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder (i.e. bipolar depression) in adults, as monotherapy and/or adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate.Schizophrenia is a complex mental illness and impacts approximately 1% of the population. It has a unique receptor binding profile and differs from other antipsychotics in that it modulates glutamate, serotonin and dopamine, which are all neurotransmitters that contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Both characteristics lend to a more favourable adverse effect profile and ultimately safer drug.Lumateperone, also known as ITI-007, is an atypical antipsychotic that has proven to be effective in the treatment of schizophrenia. In contrast to other second generation antipsychotics such as  and , lumateperone behaves as a partial agonist and as an antagonist at pre and postynaptic dopamine (D2) receptors respectively. For this reason, patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment should receive half the recommended daily dosage.There is much to learn about the pathophysiology of schizophrenia; however, dopamine abnormalities, specifically in the prefrontal and mesolimbic brain regions, are consistent in people with schizophrenia."
1372,DB06081,"aTTP is a rare autoimmune condition presented by a disruption of blood clotting order which is translated into systemic microvascular thrombosis leading to profound thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia and organ ischemia. Caplacizumab was developed by Ablynx, a Sanofi company and FDA approved on February 6, 2019, and approved previously by the EU in October 2018 as a combination therapy with plasma exchange and immunosuppression._In vitro_ studies have shown a caplacizumab-driven complete inhibition of platelet aggregation and in phase II clinical trials, it was shown to reduce the activity of the von Willebrand factor by 20% from treatment day 1 until treatment day 30. However, as caplacizumab does not target autoimmune response, relapses were observed after treatment discontinuation. The last clinical trial prior approval showed production of a platelet count of more than 150,000 per mcl after the cessation of plasma exchange therapy for 5 days as well as a reduction of patient recurrent thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and of disease-related death during treatment.Caplacizumab acts by targetting the A1 domain of the ultra-large von Willebrand factor which in order inhibits the interaction with the glycoprotein Ib-IX-V receptor in the platelets. The blockage of the von Willebrand factor prevents the interaction between the von Willebrand factor and the platelets, hence, preventing platelet aggregation."

Tirbanibulin exhibits antitumour effects in vitro and in vivo  and has been investigated for its antitumor efficacy in the management of various cancers, such as prostate cancer and breast cancer.In clinical trials composed comprising patients with actinic keratosis of the face or scalp, tirbanibulin promoted complete clearance of actinic keratosis lesions at day 57 in treated areas in 44-54% of patients compared to 5-13% of patients who received the placebo. In a clinical trial comprising patients with advanced solid tumours, dose-limiting toxicities of tirbanibulin included elevated liver transaminases, neutropenia and fatigue.Src tyrosine kinases regulate normal cell growth: the expression of Src kinase is upregulated during the normal hair cycle during the proliferative anagen phase. It binds to the peptide substrate binding site of Src, a primary target of tirbanibulin, and blocking its downstream signalling pathways that promote cancer cell migration, proliferation, and survival. It is also hypothesized that inhibition of Src can also contribute to the inhibitory effects on microtubule polymerization."

Acetylcysteine has also been studied for a wide variety of off-label indications with mixed results. Acetylcysteine's sulfhydryl groups may hydrolize disulfide bonds within mucin, breaking down the oligomers, and making the mucin less viscous. It is an antioxidant in its own right but is also deacetylated to cysteine, which participates in the synthesis of the antioxidant glutathione. The amount of NAPQI produced in an overdose saturates and depletes glutathione stores."
1382,DB06152,"It may sometimes be used in the treatment of peripheral vascular disorders in addition premature labor (however, the drug is not approved for premature labor).Nylidrin, also known as _buphenine_ belongs to the category of drugs called _vasodilators_, which relax blood vessels and increase blood flow. An increase in cerebral blood flow and a decrease in vascular resistance has also been reported. Signaling by various hormones and neurotransmitters, as well as photons and odors, follows the same general pathway, (i.e., by binding of an extracellular ligand to the receptor, which then interacts with the membrane-bound G-protein). **Heart:**    Increased intracellular cAMP by beta-2-agonists inhibits _myosin light chain kinase_, leading to relaxation  These receptors, like the receptors in the heart, are coupled to a Gs-protein, which acts stimulate the formation of cAMP. Although increased cAMP increases cardiac myocyte contraction, in vascular smooth muscle, an increase in cAMP causes smooth muscle relaxation."
1383,DB06153,"It is an antagonist at histamine H1 receptors, and is weakly anticholinergic . In a double-blind clinical study of patients with mild to moderate depression, treatment of pizotifen led to clinical improvement of the depressive symptoms. However, deterioration of the schizophrenic emotional symptoms was also observed in patients with depression and chronic schizophrenia . While the mechanism of action is not fully understood, it is proposed that pizotifen works by inhibiting the peripheral actions of serotonin and histamine in increasing the membrane permeability of cranial vessels and transudation of plasmakinin, while altering pain thresholds in migraines . There is evidence that it also inhibits the peripheral actions of bradykinin ."
1384,DB06154,"Used for the treatment of angina pectoris .Pentaerythritol tetranitrate is the nitrate ester of pentaerythritol that possesses explosive properties. When mixed with a plasticizer, this chemical forms a plastic explosive. It is recognized by the FDA to be a coronary vasodilator in the treatment of heart conditions such as angina . It is formed by reacting pentaerythritol (C5H12O4), an alcohol commonly used in paints and varnishes, with nitric acid (HNO2). Nitrate enters vascular smooth muscle and converted to nitric oxide (NO) which acts as a cellular messenger, leading to activation of cyclic GMP and, therefore, vasodilation ."

1390,DB06193,"Currently in Phase III investigation for treatment of relapsed or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in patients who have failed two prior lines of therapy. The phase III trial, PIX-R, is ongoing and will compare pixantrone multidrug therapy with an equivalent regimen in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (the most common type of NHL). In myocardial strips which are doxorubicin naive, pixantrone is taken up to a higher degree than in myocardial strips which are doxorubicin exposed, and once absorbed exhibits redox inactivity. Additionally, in ex vivo human myocardial strips (doxorubicin naive, and doxorubicin pretreated) pixantrone showed high cardiac uptake without formation of superoxide anion or hydrogen peroxide. Pixantrones lack of cardiotoxicity is thus attributed to its redox inactivity and inhibition of doxorubicinol formation."
1391,DB06196,"It was investigated as a potential treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE) as bradykinin was implicated in HAE swelling; specifically, mice lacking B2 receptors showed reduced swelling, thus demonstrating bradykinin involvement in the disease pathophysiology. Icatibant was approved by the FDA on August 25, 2011, and by the EMA in 2008 as a treatment for hereditary angioedema. The FDA approval was based on positive results obtained from 3 double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trials known as FAST 1, 2, and 3, where a median time to almost complete symptom relief was observed to be 8 hours compared to 36 hours for the placebo treatment.Following bradykinin challenge, intravenous administration of icatibant caused dose and time-dependent inhibition of the development of bradykinin-induced hypotension, vasodilation, and reflex tachycardia in healthy young subjects. Based on exposure-response analysis, a subcutaneous dose of 30 mg icatibant is predicted to be effective against bradykinin challenge for at least 6 hours.

In this, they differ from the previously discussed agents that act by attempting to curtail platelet destruction. Eltrombopag is used to treat low blood platelet counts in adults with chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenia (ITP), when certain other medicines, or surgery to remove the spleen, have not worked well enough. ITP is a condition that may cause unusual bruising or bleeding due to an abnormally low number of platelets in the blood. Eltrombopag has also been recently approved (late 2012) for the treatment of thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet counts) in patients with chronic hepatitis C to allow them to initiate and maintain interferon-based therapy.Eltrombopag is an orally bioavailable, small-molecule TPO-receptor agonist that interacts with the transmembrane domain of the human TPO-receptor."
1401,DB06211,"Doripenem is indicated in the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections and complicated urinary tract infections, including pyelonephritis, caused by designated susceptible bacteria. Doripenem injection was approved by the FDA in 2007 to treat complicated urinary tract and intra-abdominal infections. The FDA revised the doripenem label in 2014 to include a warning against use in ventilator-associated pneumonia and to reiterate its safety and efficacy for its approved indications.Similar to other beta-lactam antimicrobial agents, the time that unbound plasma concentration of doripenem exceeds the MIC (T>MIC) of the infecting organism has been shown to best correlate with efficacy in animal models of infection.Doripenem is a broad-spectrum carbapenem antibiotic with activity against many gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic bacteria, as well as a variety of anaerobes. Inhibition of PBPs 1a and 1b results in fast bacterial killing through the formation of spheroplasts, inhibition of PBP 2 results in rod-shaped bacteria to become spherical, and inhibition of PBP 3 results in filamentous-shaped organisms.

1410,DB06230,"Nalmefene injection and nasal spray are indicated for the complete or partial reversal of opioid drug effects, including respiratory depression, induced by either natural or synthetic opioids. Nalmefene injection can be used for postoperative opioid overdose reversal.Nalmefene, a 6-methylene analogue of , is an opioid receptor antagonist. Nalmefene has no opioid agonist activity and it is not associated with drug tolerance, physical dependence, or abuse potential. These withdrawal symptoms should be managed with symptomatic and supportive treatment: the administration of large amounts of opioids to patients receiving opioid antagonists in an attempt to overcome a full blockade has resulted in adverse respiratory and circulatory reactions.The opioid system consists of three opioid receptors - mu (Î¼), delta (Î´), and kappa (Îº) - that are G-protein coupled receptors. Animal studies suggest that kappa-opioid receptor signalling blocks acute reward and positive reinforcement effects of drugs with abusive potential by decreasing dopamine in the nucleus accumbens."

Most standard CMV therapies, such as  or , target CMV DNA polymerase - while generally effective, these medications tend to promote the development of CMV resistance to DNA polymerase-based therapies, and their use is often limited by toxicities like myelosuppression and renal injury. The drug was also approved by Health Canada in September 2022  and by European Commission in November 2022.Maribavir exerts its antiviral efficacy via an alternative target as compared to traditional CMV antivirals and is thus useful in the treatment of CMV infections that have proven resistant to standard therapy.Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a herpesvirus commonly causing infection in patients following stem cell or organ transplants. As with other herpesviruses, CMV tends to persist in the host and become reactivated under immunosuppressive conditions - patients requiring multiple immunosuppressive medications to combat transplant rejection are thus at a much higher risk of developing serious CMV infections. Maribavir belongs to a class of anti-cytomegalovirus antivirals called benzimidazole ribosides."
1412,DB06237,"Avanafil is indicated for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.Avanafil is a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor used in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. In comparison with other drugs of the same class, it shows greater selectivity for PDE5 over PDE6 than both  and  but less selectivity than , suggesting a relatively lower risk of visual disturbances associated with off-target PDE6 inhibition.

Its inhibitory effects on PDE5 are 100-fold more potent than on PDE6 and >1000-fold more potent than on other PDE enzymes, meaning it is less likely to cause visual disturbances and cardiovascular adverse effects when compared with less selective PDE5 inhibitors such as  and . It has a relatively quick onset of action allowing for administration as early as 15 minutes prior to sexual activity."
1413,DB06243,"It was also previously indicated for the treatment of female hirsutism and African trypanosomiasis but has since been discontinued.Eflornithine is an irreversible ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor originally developed as a treatment for human African trypanosomiasis. Further research has also implicated ornithine decarboxylase in other conditions like facial hirsutism and cancer, especially when ornithine decarboxylase is highly upregulated in tumor cells. Subsequently, on December 14, 2023, the FDA approved eflornithine again but under the brand name IWILFIN as an oral maintenance therapy to reduce the risk of relapse in adult and pediatric patients with high-risk neuroblastoma who have demonstrated at least a partial response to prior multiagent, multimodality therapy, including anti-GD2 immunotherapy. This approval is based on positive results obtained from a multi-site, single-arm, externally controlled study of children with high-risk neuroblastoma, where a 52% reduction in the risk of relapse and a 68% reduction in the risk of death were observed.Inhibition of polyamine synthesis by eflornithine restored the balance of the LIN28/Let-7 metabolic pathway, which is involved in the regulation of cancer stem cells and glycolytic metabolism, by decreasing expression of the oncogenic drivers MYCN and LIN28B in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma. In vitro, eflornithine induced senescence and suppressed neurosphere formation in MYCN-amplified and MYCN non-amplified neuroblastoma cells, indicating a cytostatic effect."

There is a deficit of noradrenaline as well as of dopamine in Parkinson's disease and it has been proposed that this underlies the sudden transient freezing seen usually in advanced disease. Though L-DOPS has been used in Japan and Southeast Asia already for some time, it is also currently in clinical trials at the phase III point in the United States (U.S.), Canada, Australia, and throughout Europe. Provided L-DOPS successfully completes clinical trials, it could be approved for the treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (NOH) as early as 2011."
1416,DB06267,"Investigated for use/treatment in erectile dysfunction and hypertension.Udenafil is a new phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED). It has been approved in South Korea and will be marketed under the brand name Zydena. It is not yet approved for use in the U.S., E.U., or Canada.Udenafil is a potent selective phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor.Udenafil inhibits the cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum located around the penis. Penile erection during sexual stimulation is caused by increased penile blood flow resulting from the relaxation of penile arteries and corpus cavernosal smooth muscle. This response is mediated by the release of nitric oxide (NO) from nerve terminals and endothelial cells, which stimulates the synthesis of cGMP in smooth muscle cells."
1417,DB06268,"Investigated for use/treatment in pulmonary hypertension, connective tissue diseases, hypertension, and congestive heart failure.Sitaxentan was marketed under the trade name Thelin for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) by Encysive Pharmaceuticals until Pfizer purchased Encysive in February 2008. In 2010, Pfizer voluntarily removed sitaxentan from the market over concerns of hepatotoxicity.Sitaxentan belongs to a class of drugs known as endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs). Patients with PAH have elevated levels of endothelin, a potent blood vessel constrictor, in their plasma and lung tissue. Sitaxentan blocks the binding of endothelin to its receptors, thereby negating endothelin's deleterious effects.Sitaxentan is a competitive antagonist of endothelin-1 at the endothelin-A (ET-A) and endothelin-B (ET-B) receptors. Under normal conditions, endothelin-1 binding of ET-A or ET-B receptors causes pulmonary vasoconstriction."
1418,DB06271,"Sulodexide has been used clinically for the prophylaxis and treatment of vascular diseases with increased risk of thrombosis, including intermittent claudication, peripheral arterial occlusive disease and post-myocardial infarc-tion. New anti-inflammatory properties have also extended its use in venous disease.Sulodexide is a mixture of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) composed of dermatan sulfate (DS) and fast moving heparin (FMH).Sulodexide is extensively absorbed owing to its low molecular weight compared to unfractionated heparin. Research has also shown that Sulodexide had endothelial protective properties by inducing the overexpression of growth factors important for the protection of organs. The intravenous administration has also been shown capable of releasing tissue factor pathway inhibitor from the endothelium, which also contributes to the anti-thrombotic effects of Sulodexide. Lastly, this drug is known for its ability to inhibit the secretion of MMPs, particularly MMP-9, from leukocytes in a dose dependent manner, resulting in the restoration of the balance with their tissue inhibitors.Thrombin inhibition produced by sulodexide is due to the additive effect of its components, namely, heparin cofactor II (HCII) catalysis by dermatan sulfate  and antithrombin-III catalysis by fast moving heparin (FMH)."

Elotuzumab consists of the complementary determining regions (CDR) of the mouse antibody, MuLuc63, grafted onto human IgG1 heavy and kappa light chain frameworks. Elotuzumab has a theoretical mass of 148.1 kDa for the intact antibody. Elotuzumab also targets SLAMF7 on myeloma cells and facilitates the interaction with Natural Killer cells to mediate the killing of myeloma cells through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In preclinical models, the combination of elotuzumab and lenalidomide resulted in enhanced activation of Natural Killer cells that was greater than the effects of either agent alone and increased anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo."
1429,DB06335,"FDA approved on July 31, 2009.Post-administration of saxagliptin, GLP-1 and GIP levels rise up to 2- to 3- fold. Because it is very selective of DPP-4 inhibition, there are fewer systemic side effects. Saxagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor antidiabetic for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Incretins decrease blood sugar by increasing consumption of sugar by the body, mainly through increasing insulin production in the pancreas, and by reducing production of sugar by the liver. The inhibition of DPP-4 increases levels active of glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which inhibits glucagon production from pancreatic alpha cells and increases production of insulin from pancreatic beta cells."
1430,DB06343,"Teprotumumab is indicated for the treatment of thyroid eye disease regardless of disease activity or duration.Teprotumumab is a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed against the human insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor. Thyroid eye disease is a potentially debilitating complication of Graves' Disease involving inflammation and tissue remodeling behind the eye, and previous treatment options typically involved multiple invasive surgeries - teprotumumab is the first drug ever approved for the treatment of TED and therefore represents a significant step forward in the treatment this disease.Teprotumumab inhibits the downstream effects of IGF-1R signaling, namely tissue inflammation and remodeling, which are responsible for the various symptoms of thyroid eye disease. Teprotumumab may cause disease flares in patients with pre-existing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) - patients experiencing an exacerbation should discontinue therapy with teprotumumab. It has been demonstrated that insulin-like growth factor-1 receptors (IGF-1R) are overexpressed by orbital fibroblasts in patients with thyroid eye disease, in addition to being overexpressed on T-cells and B-cells in these patients. It was found that Gravesâ Disease IgG molecules could mimic the principal ligand of IGF-1R, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and their binding of IGF-1R induces the expression of chemokines that play roles in tissue remodeling and inflammation."
1431,DB06366,"Pertuzumab is also indicated for subcutaneous injection - in combination with trastuzumab and  - in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancers in adults.Pertuzumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the extracellular dimerization domain (subdomain II) of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 protein (HER2). It consists of two heavy chains and two lights chains that have 448 and 214 residues respectively.Its indicated conditions have since expanded to include use as both a neoadjuvant therapy and an adjuvant therapy in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancers at high risk of recurrence.Pertuzumab exerts its antineoplastic effects by binding to and inhibiting the activity of HER2, an oncogene that has been implicated in the formation of numerous cancers. As with other therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, pertuzumab has a relatively long duration of action necessitating dosing every 3 weeks. Pertuzumab targets the extracellular dimerization domain (subdomain II) of HER2, thereby inhibiting ligand-initiated intracellular signaling via the MAP kinase and PI3K pathways. Inhibition of these pathways results in inhibition of cell growth and the initiation of apoptosis, respectively."

1437,DB06404,"Intravenous and subcutaneous formulations of the human C1-esterase inhibitor are indicated for routine prophylaxis against acute attacks of hereditary angioedema in patients six years of age and older. The primary function of endogenous C1INH is to regulate the activation of the complement and contact system pathways. The disease is characterized by acute attacks of painful, and in some cases, fatal swelling of several soft tissues or edema, which may last up to five days when untreated.The C1 esterase inhibitor treats and prevents attacks of hereditary angioedema. It has a long duration of action as it is given every 3-4 days prophylactically. By providing patients with C1 esterase inhibitors, this may prevent contact system activation, which prevents increases in vascular permeability."
1438,DB06410,"Doxercalciferol is indicated for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis, as well as for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with Stage 3 or Stage 4 chronic kidney disease. Specifically, the biologically active vitamin D metabolites control the intestinal absorption of dietary calcium, the tubular reabsorption of calcium by the kidney and, in conjunction with parathyroid hormone (PTH), the mobilization of calcium from the skeleton. They act directly on bone cells (osteoblasts) to stimulate skeletal growth, and on the parathyroid glands to suppress PTH (parathyroid hormone) synthesis and secretion. These functions are mediated by the interaction of these biologically active metabolites with specific receptor proteins in the various target tissues. In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), deficient production of biologically active vitamin D metabolites (due to lack of or insufficient 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1-alpha-hydroxylase activity) leads to secondary hyperparathyroidism, which contributes to the development of metabolic bone disease."

An advantage Cangrelor provides over oral P2Y12 inhibitors (such as prasugrel, ticagrelor, and clopidogrel) is that it is an active drug not requiring metabolic conversion therefore providing a rapid onset and offset of action. Cangrelor was approved by the FDA in June 2015 for intravenous application.Cangrelor is a selective, reversible, P2Y12 platelet receptor antagonist which inhibits ADP platelet aggregation. ADP is typically released by damaged blood vessels, red blood cells, and/or platelets due to agonists stimulating platelet activity. ADP binds to P2Y12 to stimulate and complete platelet aggregation by inhibiting adenylyl cyclase by a Gi protein, thus potentiating dense granule secretion and increasing coagulation activity."
1444,DB06448,"It is also indicated in this same population for the treatment of processing-deficient progeroid laminopathies that either involve a heterozygous LMNA mutation resulting in the accumulation of a progerin-like protein or homozygous/compound heterozygous mutations in ZMPSTE24.Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder estimated to affect approximately one in 20 million individuals resulting in adverse symptoms associated with premature ageing: skeletal dysplasia, joint contractures, atherosclerosis, myocardial fibrosis/dysfunction, scleroderma-like cutaneous effects, lipoatrophy, alopecia, and a severe failure to thrive; HGPS is uniformly fatal. Mechanistically, HGPS is underpinned by a single heterozygous C-to-T mutation at position 1824 of the LMNA gene, which results in the accumulation of an aberrant farnesylated form of lamin A called progerin in the inner nuclear membrane. Lonafarnib is a farnesyl transferase (FTase) inhibitor (FTI), which reduces the farnesylation of numerous cellular proteins, including progerin; as progerin farnesylation is important for localization to the nuclear membrane, lonafarnib inhibits progerin accumulation and improves symptoms in HGPS patients. Lonafarnib was granted FDA approval on November 20, 2020, and is the first FDA-approved treatment for HGPS and other related progeroid laminopathies.Lonafarnib is a direct farnesyl transferase inhibitor that reduces the farnesylation of numerous cellular proteins, including progerin, the aberrantly truncated form of lamin A that accumulates in progeroid laminopathies such as Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome.

Targeting T cells can be achieved through antibodies against the T cell receptor (TCR) component CD3. On November 2022, teplizumab was approved by the FDA as the first drug that can delay the onset of type 1 diabetes.Teplizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to CD3 molecules on the surface of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, both involved in the destruction of pancreatic Î² cells. Combined with other observations from animal and human studies, it is clear that T and B cells play a role in T1D; treatment has focussed on targeting each of them independently, as well as their interactions. It is clear, however, that treatment is most effective in patients who have not yet progressed to Stage 3 and who have an active immune response."
1454,DB06607,"For use in the management of malignant ascites tumours via intraperitoneal infusion where standard therapy is not available or feasible .Catumaxumab is a trifunctional monoclonal antibody developed for use in cancer treatment. Catumaxumab was initially authorized for market by the European Medicines Agency in April 2009 for the treatment of malignant ascites . By binding to CD3 on killer T cells, EpCAM on cancer cells, and FcÎ³ receptors on accessory immune cells like macrophages and NK cells, Catumaxomab brings immune cells into close proximity to EpCAM positive cancer cells. As a functional antibody, Catumaxomab also stimulates bound NK cells to release cytotoxic mediators like granzyme or bound macrophages to phagocytose the cancer cell. Phagocytosed cancer cells can be processed and have their antigens presented on major histocompatibililty complex II to activate helper T cells and contribute to humoural immunity and activation of killer T cells against EpCAM postive cancer cells."
1455,DB06608,"Vivax malaria, caused by _Plasmodium vivax_, is known to be less virulent and seldom causes death. It was discovered by the scientists at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in 1978 as a substitute for primaquine that would be more effective against relapsing vivax malaria. It was FDA approved on July 20, 2018.In vitro studies have shown that tafenoquine presents an average 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.436 mcg against blood stages of seven strains of _P. In prophylactic studies, tafenoquine showed an efficacy range from 84 to 87% against falciparum malaria and 99.1% against vivax malaria.The mechanism of action of tafenoquine is not well established but studies have reported a longer and more effective action when compared to primaquine. On the other hand, tafenoquine inhibits heme polymerase in blood stage of parasites which explains the activity against blood stages of parasites."

It is a first generation antihistamine. However, it rapidly permeates the brain and so often causes drowsiness as a side effect. It has been found in over-the-counter combination products for colds and menstrual symptoms, but is considered to be an unapproved prescription medication used for cough, cold, or allergic conditions.Mepyramine is a histamine H1 receptor inverse agonist. It binds to a G protein-coupled form of the receptor and promotes a G protein-coupled inactive state of the H1 receptor that interferes with the Gq/11-mediated signaling."
1472,DB06692,"For prophylactic use to reduce perioperative blood loss and the need for blood transfusion in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass in the course of coronary artery bypass graft surgery who are at an increased risk for blood loss and blood transfusion.Aprotinin is a protein-based drug that is also known as bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI). For this use, it is typically administered by injection. The goal of using of aprotinin was subsequently to minimize end-organ damage resulting from hypotension due to blood loss in surgery and to reduce the necessity for blood transfusions during surgery. Aprotinin, through its inhibition of multiple mediators  results in the attenuation of inflammatory responses, fibrinolysis, and thrombin generation. Inhibition of plasmin also slows fibrinolysis."
1473,DB06694,"Xylometazoline is indicated for the temporary relief of nasal congestion due to cold, hay fever or other respiratory allergies.Xylometazoline is an imidazoline derivative  with sympathomimetic and nasal decongestant activity. Xylometazoline is a sympathomimetic agent that causes vasoconstriction of the nasal mucosa. This suggests that xylometazoline has a beneficial effect against oxidants, which play a role in tissue damage in inflammation.Nasal congestion is caused by various etiologies, such as rhinosinusitis and allergic or non-allergic rhinitis, leading to congestion of the venous sinusoids lining the nasal mucosa. Activation of Î±-adrenergic receptors leads to vasoconstriction of the blood vessels of the nasal mucosa and resumption of nasal airflow. In one study, subjects with nasal congestion reported relief of earache and sore throat in addition to nasal decongestion: it is speculated that oxymetazoline mediates this effect by causing vasoconstriction of the nasal mucosa that contains the venous sinuses and nasal decongestion allows breathing through the nose, providing relief from sore throat caused by mouth breathing that dries and irritates the throat."

1486,DB06709,"Methacholine is indicated in adult and pediatric patients aged five years and older without clinically apparent asthma for the diagnosis of bronchial airway hyperactivity via the methacholine challenge test.Asthma is a complex condition associated with phenomena such as airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), in which the smooth muscle in the airways (ASM) excessively contracts in response to stimuli, reducing pulmonary function and causing symptoms such as difficulty breathing. Methacholine is a non-specific cholinergic agonist (parasympathomimetic) that acts through muscarinic receptors in the lungs to induce bronchoconstriction. In patients with AHR, a lower dose of methacholine is required to induce bronchoconstriction, which forms the basis for the methacholine challenge test to diagnose AHR. Therefore, methacholine carries a risk of severe bronchoconstriction, especially in patients with pre-existing reduced pulmonary function (typically baseline FEV1 < 60% or < 1.5 L, at least in adults), clinically apparent asthma or wheezing, or other health conditions such as uncontrolled hypertension, aortic aneurysm, or history of myocardial infarction or stroke. Excessive ASM contraction in response to contractile agonists, a phenomenon termed airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), is a physical manifestation of the altered pulmonary physiology in asthma."

On average, the adult male body produces about twenty times the amount of testosterone than an adult female's body does.The effects of testosterone in humans and other vertebrates occur by way of two main mechanisms: by activation of the androgen receptor (directly or as DHT), and by conversion to estradiol and activation of certain estrogen receptors. Free testosterone (T) is transported into the cytoplasm of target tissue cells, where it can bind to the androgen receptor, or can be reduced to 5&alpha;-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the cytoplasmic enzyme 5&alpha;-reductase."
1488,DB06711,"It acts to decrease congestion and is found in many over the counter (OTC) eye drops and nasal preparations. Naphazoline was first developed in 1942 as a nasal formulation for congestion.Naphazoline is a sympathomimetic alpha adrenergic agonist that acts to vasoconstrict nasal or ocular arterioles, resulting in reduced congestion at the site of administration.Naphazoline is a vasoconstrictor that functions by stimulating alpha adrenergic receptors in arterioles leading to decreased congestion at the site of administration. Naphazoline causes the release of norepinephrine in sympathetic nerves. Norepinephrine binds to alpha adrenergic receptors and causes vasoconstriction. Naphazoline's release of norepinephrine also triggers a negative feedback loop which decreases production of norepinephrine, which can lead to rhinitis medicamentosa after long term use when naphazoline is stopped."
1489,DB06712,"For the management of vasospastic angina, chronic stable angina and hypertension.Nilvadipine is a calcium channel blocker (CCB) for the treatment of hypertension.Nilvadipine is similar to other dihydropyridines including amlodipine, felodipine, isradipine, and nicardipine. Nilvadipine is used to treat Prinzmetal's angina, hypertension, and other vascular disorders such as Raynaud's phenomenon. By blocking the calcium channels, Nifedipine inhibits the spasm of the coronary artery and dilates the systemic arteries, results in a increase of myocardial oxygen supply and a decrease in systemic blood pressure.Nilvadipine inhibits the influx of extracellular calcium through myocardial and vascular membrane pores by physically plugging the channel. The decrease in intracellular calcium inhibits the contractile processes of smooth muscle cells, causing dilation of the coronary and systemic arteries, increased oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue, decreased total peripheral resistance, decreased systemic blood pressure, and decreased afterload."
1490,DB06713,"Norelgestromin is used for contraception and menopausal hormonal therapy. Norelgestromin is a drug used in contraception. Norelgestromin is the active progestin responsible for the progestational activity that occurs in women after application of ORTHO EVRA patch.Norelgestromin is used for contraception and menopausal hormonal therapy transdermally or in combination with ethinyl estradiol as a vaginal ring. Norelgestromin inhibits estrone sulfatase, which converts sulfated steroid precursors to estrogen during pregnancy. It also has similar agonisting binding affinities as its parent compound, Norgestimate, for progesterone and estrogen receptors."
1491,DB06714,"It is used to provide temporary symptomatic relief of nasal congestion due to colds, allergies and allergic rhinitis.Propylhexedrine is an alpha-adrenergic agonist often used in nasal decongestant inhalers. It is used to give temporary relief for nasal congestion from colds, allergic rhinitis, or allergies.Like other monoamine releasing stimulants propylhexedrine is active as a norepinephrine and dopamine releaser in the central nervous system. The acute effects of the drug closely resemble the physiological and psychological effects of an epinephrine-provoked fight-or-flight response, including increased heart rate and blood pressure, vasoconstriction (constriction of the arterial walls), bronchodilation, and hyperglycemia (increased blood sugar).Propylhexidrine causes the norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin (5HT) transporters to reverse their direction of flow. This inversion leads to a release of these transmitters from the vesicles to the cytoplasm and from the cytoplasm to the synapse. It also antagonizes the action of VMAT2, causing the release of more neurotransmitters."
1492,DB06715,"Potassium Iodide is oral antithyroid agent used in the prevention of radioactive iodine uptake into the thyroid gland during a nuclear radiation emergency. Potassium Iodide may be used as an adjunct to other antithyroid agents in the treatment of hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis and preoperatively to induce thyroid involution.Saturated solution of Potassium Iodide (SSKI) is used pharmaceutically for emergency use in patients experiencing acute symptoms of severe hyperthyroidism (also known as thyroid storm or thyrotoxic crisis). SSKI can also be used for radioiodine-contamination emergencies or in preparation of thyrotoxic patients for thyroidectomy.It works in the thyroid gland. By inhibiting thyroid hormone synthesis and release, thyroid gland vascularity is reduced, thyroid gland tissue becomes firmer, thyroid cell size is reduced, follicular colloid reaccumulates, and bound iodine levels increase. As a protectant following radiation exposure, KI blocks the uptake of radioactive iodine isotopes by the thyroid gland thereby minimizing the risk of radiation-induced thyroid neoplasms."

Fospropofol is a water soluble prodrug and is converted to propofol in the liver. FDA approved in December 2008. 1.86 mg of fospropofol is the molar equivalent for 1mg of propofol. By binding to GABA-A receptor, it will cause an increase in chloride conductance, thus inhibiting the firing of new action potentials in the post-synaptic neuron."
1494,DB06717,"It aids in the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy treatment.Fosaprepitant is a prodrug of Aprepitant. Once biologically activated, the drug acts as a substance P/neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonist which, in combination with other antiemetic agents, is indicated for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy. Animal and human studies show that Aprepitant augments the antiemetic activity of the 5-HT3-receptor antagonist ondansetron and the corticosteroid  ethasone and inhibits both the acute and delayed phases of cisplatin induced emesis. In summary, the active form of fosaprepitant is as an NK1 antagonist which is because it blocks signals given off by NK1 receptors. This therefore decreases the likelihood of vomiting in patients experiencing."
1495,DB06718,"C1-inhibitor is a protease that inhibits the complement system (part of the innate immune system), a biochemical chain of reactions which assists the body in removing pathogens from the body. Stanozolol can be administered orally or intramuscularly. Stanozolol is a synthetic anabolic steroid with therapeutic uses in treating hereditary angioedema. Stanozolol is derived from testosterone, and has been abused by several high profile professional athletes.Stanozolol is a synthetic anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS), which promotes cell growth (anabolism) and development/maintenance of masculine characteristics (androgenism).

1496,DB06719,"Buserelin may be used in the treatment of hormone-responsive cancers such as prostate cancer or breast cancer, estrogen-dependent conditions (such as endometriosis or uterine fibroids), and in assisted reproduction.Buserelin is a synthetic peptide analog of the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist, which stimulates the pituitary gland's gonadotrophin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR). Buserelin also has a longer duration of action than natural LHRH. Investigations in healthy adult males and females have demonstrated that the increase in plasma LH and FSH levels persist for at least 7 hours and that a return to basal values requires about 24 hours. Clinical inhibition of gonadotropin release, and subsequent reduction of serum testosterone or estradiol to castration level, was found when large pharmacologic doses (50-500 mcg SC/day or 300-1200 mcg IN/day) were administered for periods greater than 1 to 3 months. While initially, there is a rise in FSH and LH levels, chronic administration of Buserelin results in a sustained suppression of these hormones."
1497,DB06723,"For relief of heartburn and acid indigestion. Aluminum hydroxide is an inorganic salt used as an antacid. An increase in bicarbonate ions and prostaglandins may also confer cytoprotective effects.Gastric-peptic disease occurs as a result of an imbalance between protective factors, such as mucus, bicarbonate, and prostaglandin secretion, and aggressive factors, such as hydrochloric acid, pepsin, and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). Aluminum hydroxide is a basic inorganic salt that acts by neutralizing hydrochloric acid in gastric secretions. It also inhibits the action of pepsin by increasing the pH and via adsorption."

1499,DB06725,"For the treatment of acute mild to moderate pain, as well as pain and inflammation of the joints caused by certain types of rheumatic diseases.Lornoxicam (chlortenoxicam) is a new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of the oxicam class with analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties. Lornoxicam differs from other oxicam compounds in its potent inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis, a property that explains the particularly pronounced efficacy of the drug. As with other NSAIDS, lornoxicam is a potent inhibitor of the cyclooxgenase enzymes, which are responsible for catalyzing the formation of prostaglandins (act as messenger molecules in the process of inflammation) and thromboxane from arachidonic acid. Unlike some NSAIDS, lornoxicam's inhibition of cyclooxygenase does not lead to an increase in leukotriene formation, meaning that arachidonic acid is not moved to the 5-lipoxygenase cascade, resulting in the minimization of the risk of adverse events.Like other NSAIDS, lornoxicam's anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity is related to its inhibitory action on prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis through the inhibition of both COX-1 and COX-2. However, the exact mechanism of lornoxicam, like that of the other NSAIDs, has not been fully determined."

1501,DB06736,"Aceclofenac is an oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with marked anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties used to treat osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Aceclofenac potently inhibits the cyclo-oxygenase enzyme (COX) that is involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins, which are inflammatory mediators that cause pain, swelling, inflammation, and fever. Although the mode of action of aceclofenac is thought to mainly arise from the inhibition of synthesis of prostaglandins (PGE2), aceclofenac also inhibits the production of inflammatory cytokines, interleukins (IL-1Î², IL-6), and tumor necrosis factors (TNF) . It is also reported that aceclofenac also affects the cell adhesion molecules from neutrophils . Inhibition of IL-6 is thought to be mediated by diclofenac converted from aceclofenac ."

It is approved for use in Thailand as oral tablets or intramuscular injections.Drotaverine is an e spasmolytic agent with a relaxing effect on smooth muscles. Recent research showed that low levels of cAMP have been associated with brain tumorigenesis, leading to the investigation of PDE4 inhibitors as potential anticancer agents."
1504,DB06754,"Danaparoid possesses a potent antithrombic activity that works by inhibiting activated factor X (Factor Xa) and activated factor II (Factor IIa). Danaproid is used in the treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) as an off-label indication and prevention of post-operative deep venous thrombosis (DVT). It has a high antifactor Xa to antifactor IIa (thrombin) activity that primarily works via antithrombin III-mediated inhibition of factor Xa . Via binding to antithrombin and inducing a conformational change , danaparoid enhances and catalyzes the the binding of factor Xa to antithrombin, which induces antithrombin-mediated inactivation of factor Xa. There is evidence that danaparoid also suppresses the activation of factor IX which, in conjunction with simultaneous inhibition of factor X, may lead to antithrombic effects ."
1505,DB06755,"Beta-carotene is FDA approved to be used as a nutrient supplement and to be even added in infant formula as a source of vitamin A. It is used commonly for the reduction of photosensitivity in patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria and other photosensitivity diseases.Beta-carotene, with the molecular formula C40H56, belongs to the group of carotenoids consisting of isoprene units. The presence of long chains of conjugated double bonds donates beta-carotene with specific colors. It is an antioxidant that can be found in yellow, orange and green leafy vegetables and fruits.

1506,DB06756,"Betaine reduces plasma homocysteine levels in patients with homocystinuria. In patients with MTHFR deficiency and cbl defects, betaine may increase methionine and S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) plasma levels. This condition can be caused by deficiencies or defects in cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), and cobalamin cofactor metabolism (cbl). CBS converts homocysteine to cystathionine, and a deficiency in this enzyme can lead to an accumulation of homocysteine. Additionally, a defect in cobalamin (vitamin B12) cofactor metabolism can lead to homocystinuria, since a metabolite of cobalamin (methylcobalamin) promotes the conversion of homocysteine to methionine."
1507,DB06761,"Beractant is indicated for prevention and treatment of Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) in premature infants.Beractant is a pulmonary surfactant used for the treatment of Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) in premature infants. Considered a natural source of surfactant as it is made from bovine lung extract, beractant contains a mixture of phospholipids, neutral lipids, fatty acids, and surfactant-associated proteins such as SP-B and SP-C. It is suspended in 0.9% sodium chloride solution, and heat-sterilized. However, in Respiratory Distress Syndrome, developmental deficiency of surfactant results collapse of the alveoli causing fast breathing, increased heart rate, apoxia, and sometimes death. In vivo, single doses improve lung pressure-volume measurements, lung compliance, and oxygenation in premature rabbits and sheep.Beractant replenishes lung surfactant and restores surface activity to the lungs by lowering surface tension on alveolar surfaces during respiration and stabilizing the alveoli against collapse at resting transpulmonary pressures."

Due to its low affinity for the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux pump, cabazitaxel can more readily penetrate the bloodâbrain barrier compared to other taxanes like  and . Cabazitaxel is used to treat metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. It was first approved by the FDA on June 17, 2010. Cabazitaxel binds to the N-terminal amino acids of the beta-tubulin subunit and promotes microtubule polymerization while simultaneously inhibiting disassembly: this results in the stabilization of microtubules, preventing microtubule cell division."
1515,DB06773,"Human calcitonin is indicated for the treatment of Paget's disease in the cases where the use of salmon calcitonin may provoke the generation of high-titer of antibodies. The increased activity in bone is associated with a rise in serum level of alkaline phosphatase and the increased urinary excretion of hydroxyproline which is a product of bone breakdown.Calcitonin was first discovered in isolated parathyroid tissue as a substance with a serum-calcium-lowering effect. It is used as an alternative for people developing antibodies against salmon calcitonin.Administration of human calcitonin has shown to increase bone calcium content and reduce the levels of serum calcium and serum phosphorus. Calcitonin can increase excretion of calcium, phosphate, and sodium. For this reason, the use of human calcitonin is only indicated when there is the appearance of a high-titer of antibodies anti-salmon calcitonin because these antibodies are suggested to cause a relapse.Calcitonin inhibits osteoclast-mediated bone resorption through the regulation of the number and activity of osteoclasts."

1538,DB06813,"Pralatrexate is designed to have a higher affinity for the reduced folate carrier, a protein that is overexpressed in malignant cells and is upregulated by oncogenes. It is also being studied for other types of lymphoma and solid malignancy such as non-small-cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and bladder cancer.Pralatrexate is a folate analog that inhibits folate metabolism, thus impeding the synthesis of amino acids and nucleic acid. Compared to methotrexate, pralatrexate binds to the reduced folate carrier protein-1 (RFC-1) for cellular uptake with 10-times the affinity and is a more potent substrate for FPGS. Folate is a water-soluble vitamin required for DNA synthesis and maintenance as well as DNA, RNA, and protein methylation. This reaction both increases cellular retention of pralatrexate for extended drug action and impedes the uptake of folate, also a substrate of FPGS, to further inhibit folate metabolism in cancer cells."
1539,DB06815,"Pyrithione zinc is commonly found as an active ingredient in OTC antidandruff topical treatments such as shampoos. It mediates its action by increasing the cellular levels of copper, and damaging iron-sulfur clusters of proteins essential for fungal metabolism and growth . In patients with dandruff, treatment with pyrithione zinc reduced the amount of fungus on the scalp, which reduces the amount of free fatty acids, thereby reducing scalp flaking and itch .Inhibition of fungal growth by pyrithione zinc is linked to increased copper uptake and cellular levels of copper, which is demonstrated by decreased CTR1-lacZ expression and slightly increased CUP1-lacZ expression in affected microorganisms . The coordination complex of pyrithione zinc dissociates, and pyrithione ligand forms a CuPT complex from available extracellular copper in the target organism. Decreased activity of Fe-S proteins leads to inhibition of fungal metabolism and fungal growth."

1570,DB08867,"As the product Ella (available in Canada and the US), ulipristal is indicated for use as emergency contraception after unprotected intercourse or possible contraceptive failure when administered within 120 hours (5 days) after unprotected intercourse or a known or suspected contraceptive failure. As the product Fibristal (available in Canada), ulipristal is indicated for treatment of the signs and symptoms of uterine fibroids in adult women.Ulipristal is a selective progesterone receptor modulator used for the purposes of emergency contraception (Ella) and for the treatment of uterine fibroids (Fibristal). Nevertheless, current and ongoing research into the agent's mechanism of action as an emergency contraceptive continue to provide potentially plausible evidence that ulipristal may, in fact, elicit activity on the endometrium that prevents embryo implantation .Ulipristal is a selective, reversible progestin receptor modulator and its tissue targets include the uterus, cervix, ovaries, and hypothalamus. If given early-luteal phase, a decrease in endometrial thickness can be observed. Regardless, however, considering current and on-going research into ulipristal's ability to prevent embryo implantation, the notion that the medication can elicit post-fertilization effects potentially raises alerts and/or ethical debates over the use of ulipristal owing to potential abortifacient activity , which is considered to be on par or equipotent to that of mifepristone ."
1571,DB08868,"Fingolimod is indicated for the treatment of patients aged 10 and above with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, which may include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, as well as active secondary progressive disease.Multiple sclerosis, or MS, is a devastating inflammatory disease that often progresses and causes severe neurological, physical, and cognitive effects. Fingolimod was also studied for the treatment of COVID-19, the disease caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.In multiple sclerosis, fingolimod binds to sphingosine receptors, reducing its associated neuroinflammation.In COVID-19, it may reduce lung inflammation and improve the clinical outcomes of patients with this disease. S1P1R, S1P2R, and S1P3R receptors can be found in the cardiovascular, immune, and central nervous systems. The active form of the drug, fingolimod phosphate, is a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator that exerts its mechanism of action in MS by binding to various sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors (1, 3, 4, and 5). Despite this, with the tissue findings of pulmonary edema and hyaline membrane formation, the timely use of immune modulators such as fingolimod can be considered to prevent acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with COVID-19."

Compared to the average time of 10 to 15 years for a drug to go from pre-clinical to clinical studies, enzalutamide was developed relatively rapidly.Enzalutamide is a second-generation antiandrogen that blocks the activity of androgen and androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer. However, resistance will eventually arise after the commencement of ADT in 2-3 years due to the accumulation of mutations, including constitutively active mutation, AR overexpression, and changes in AR splicing variants. Clinical trials on prostate cancer patients indicated that enzalutamide can lead to a decrease in serum PSA for at least 12 weeks, although this response can be short-lived and thus resulting in enzalutamide resistance. Patients receiving enzalutamide also had a 37% decreased in the risk of death compared to placebo.Enzalutamide is a competitive androgen receptor (AR) inhibitor that has a threefold inhibition on the androgen signaling pathway without significant AR agonist activity."

Breast cancer may be estrogen sensitive or insensitive. A majority of breast cancers are estrogen sensitive. Thus removal of estrogen from the body can be an effective treatment for hormone sensitive breast cancers. Formestane, an aromatase inhibitor, can thus help to decrease the local production of estrogen by blocking the aromatase enzyme in peripheral tissues (ie."
1604,DB08906,"Though effective for the treatment of asthma, corticosteroids may not affect symptoms immediately. Trials in subjects with asthma have shown a favorable ratio between topical anti-inflammatory activity and systemic corticosteroid effects with recommended doses of orally inhaled fluticasone furoate. For subjects with asthma, a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial in 104 pediatric subjects showed no difference between once-daily treatment with 50 mcg fluticasone compared with placebo on serum cortisol weighted mean (0 to 24 hours) and serum cortisol AUC(0-24) following 6 weeks of treatment. A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial in 185 subjects with asthma aged 12 to 65 years showed no difference between once-daily treatment with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 100 mcg/25 mcg or fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 200 mcg/25 mcg compared with placebo on serum cortisol weighted mean (0 to 24 hours), serum cortisol AUC(0-24), and 24-hour urinary cortisol after 6 weeks of treatment, whereas prednisolone 10 mg given once daily for 7 days resulted in significant cortisol suppression. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids may contribute to their efficacy."
1605,DB08907,"This drug is used in conjunction with diet and exercise to increase glycemic control in adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus . Another indication for canagliflozin is the prevention of major cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or death due to a cardiovascular cause) in patients with type 2 diabetes, as well as hospitalization for heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes.

1617,DB08932,Macitentan is indicated for the treatment of WHO group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) both alone and in combination with tadalafil.Macitentan is a dual endothelin receptor antagonist used in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Macitentan differs from its predecessor  due to its lower risk of hepatotoxicity.Macitentan acts primarily by reducing vasoconstriction and cell proliferation due to endothelin overexpression.Macitentan is an antagonist which binds to the endothelin A and B receptors (EA and EB) and blocks signaling from endothelin-1 and -2. EA receptor activation is also known to contribute to pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell proliferation. The binding of endothelins to the EB receptors acts in opposition to EA signaling by activating the same PLC cascade in endothelial cells to activate endothelial nitric oxide synthase. Macitentan is thought to provide its therapeutic effect primarily via blocking signaling through EA which produces both decreased vasoconstriction via reduced smooth muscle cell contractility and attenuation of the hyperproliferation of smooth muscle cells found in PAH.
1618,DB08933,"Luliconazole is indicated for the treatment of interdigital tinea pedis, tinea cruris, or tinea corporis infections caused by Trichophyton rubrum and Epidermophyton floccosum.Luliconazole is a topical antifungal agent that acts by unknown mechanisms but is postulated to involve altering the synthesis of fungi cell membranes. It was approved by the FDA (USA) in November 2013 and is marketed under the brand name Luzu. Luliconazole is also approved in Japan.Luliconazole kills the organisms Trichophyton rubrum and Epidermophyton floccosum, most likely by altering their fungal cell membranes.The exact mechanism of action for luliconazole's anti-fungal activity is still not known, but luliconazole is thought to inhibit the enzyme lanosterol demethylase. Lanosterol demethylase is needed for the synthesis of ergosterol, which is a major component of the fungus cell membranes."

In comparing Leishmania drug susceptibility, it has been found that L. donovani is the most susceptible to miltefosine while L. major is the least susceptible. It is currently the only recognized oral agent used to treat visceral, cutaneous, and mucosal forms of leishmaniasis, a neglected tropical disease. It can be administered topically or orally and is only indicated in patients aged 12 years or older. The CDC has also recommended it as a first line treatment for free-living amebae (FLA) infections such as primary amebic meningoencephalitis and granulomatous amebic encephalitis.Little is known about the clinical pharmacodynamics of miltefosine and other antileishmanial drugs."
1630,DB09033,"Vedolizumab is indicated for adult patients with moderately to severely active Ulcerative Colitis or Crohnâs disease. The interaction of the Î±4Î²7 integrin with MAdCAM-1 has been implicated as an important contributor to chronic inflammation, a hallmark of ulcerative colitis and Crohnâs disease. Inhibition of Î±4Î²7 integrin by vedolizumab prevents the adhesion of lymphocytes to its natural ligand, thus decreasing the migration of memory T-lymphocytes across the endothelium into inflamed gastrointestinal parenchymal tissue. A reduction in gastrointestinal inflammation was observed in rectal biopsy specimens from Phase 2 ulcerative colitis patients exposed to vedolizumab for four or six weeks compared to placebo control as assessed by histopathology. In a study of 14 healthy subjects, vedolizumab did not affect the CD4+ lymphocyte cell counts, CD8+ lymphocyte cell counts, or the CD4+:CD8+ ratios in the CSF.Vedolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the Î±4Î²7 integrin and blocks the interaction of Î±4Î²7 integrin with MAdCAM-1."
1631,DB09034,"Suvorexant is indicated for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance.Suvorexant is a selective dual antagonist of orexin receptors OX1R and OX2R that promotes sleep by reducing wakefulness and arousal. It has been approved for the treatment of insomnia.Suvorexant is a dual antagonist of orexin receptors OX1R and OX2R. It exerts its pharmacological effect by inhibiting binding of neuropeptides orexin A and B, also known as hypocretin 1 and 2, that are produced by neurons in the lateral hypothalamus. These neurons control the wake-promoting centers of the brain and are active during wakefulness, especially during motor activities, and stop firing during sleep. By inhibiting the reinforcement of arousal systems, suvorexant use causes a decrease in arousal and wakefulness, rather than having a direct sleep-promoting effect."

Its use is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD) who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative and human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) negative. It is administered as a 1 hour intravenous infusion every 3 weeks.Siltuximab-neutralized antibody-IL-6 complexes interfere with current immunological-based IL-6 quantification methods, therefore measurement of serum or plasma IL-6 concentrations should not be used as a pharmacodynamic marker during treatment. By preventing IL-6 signalling through treatment with siltuximab, CYP450 activity may be increased leading to faster metabolism of drugs that are CYP450 substrates. Siltuximab complexes with human IL-6 and prevents binding to soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors, thereby inhibiting the proliferation of lymphocytes."
1634,DB09037,"Pembrolizumab is indicated for the following conditions: Melanoma  - for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma (adult patients in the US and patients â¥12 years old in the EU)  - for the adjuvant treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with Stage IIB, IIC, or III melanoma following complete resection .

It was generated by grafting the variable sequences of a very high-affinity mouse antihuman PD-1 antibody onto a human IgG4-kappa isotype containing a stabilizing S228P Fc mutation. In the time since its initial approval, pembrolizumab has been granted approval in the treatment of a wide variety of cancers.Pembrolizumab exerts its pharmacologic effects by releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response, which in turn improves the anti-tumor immune response. The binding of pembrolizumab to PD-1 prevents this inhibitory pathway, causing a physiological shift towards immune reactivity and enhancing tumor immunosurveillance and anti-tumor immune response."
1635,DB09038,"Empagliflozin is not approved for use in patients with type 1 diabetes.Empagliflozin is an inhibitor of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2), the transporters primarily responsible for the reabsorption of glucose in the kidney. The first known inhibitor of SGLTs, phlorizin, was isolated from the bark of apple trees in 1835 and researched extensively into the 20th century, but was ultimately deemed inappropriate for clinical use given its lack of specificity and significant gastrointestinal side effects. As its mechanism of action is contingent on the renal excretion of glucose, empagliflozin may be held in cases of acute kidney injury and/or discontinued in patients who develop chronic renal disease. SGLT2 on the apical membrane of these cells then utilize this gradient to facilitate secondary active co-transport of both Na+ and glucose out of the filtrate, thereby reabsorbing glucose back into the blood â inhibiting this co-transport, then, allows for a marked increase in glucosuria and decrease in blood glucose levels. Empagliflozin is a potent inhibitor of renal SGLT2 transporters located in the proximal tubules of the kidneys and works to lower blood glucose levels via an increase in glucosuria."

1652,DB09061,"Cannabinoid receptors are utilized endogenously by the body through the endocannabinoid system, which includes a group of lipid proteins, enzymes, and receptors that are involved in many physiological processes. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are two types of cannabinoids found naturally in the resin of the marijuana plant, both of which interact with the cannabinoid receptors that are found throughout the body. In contrast to THC's weak agonist activity, CBD has been shown to act as a negative allosteric modulator of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor, the most abundant G-Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) in the body . Allosteric regulation is achieved through the modulation of receptor activity on a functionally distinct site from the agonist or antagonist binding site which is clinically significant as direct agonists (such as THC) are limited by their psychomimetic effects such as changes to mood, memory, and anxiety. However, it is known that CBD acts on cannabinoid (CB) receptors of the endocannabinoid system, which are found in numerous areas of the body, including the peripheral and central nervous systems, including the brain."

1656,DB09067,"Endogenous forms hCRH are involved in the stress response and its main function is stimulation of the pituitary to release ACTH. It provides a differential diagnosis for Cushing's disease (a pituitary source of ACTH excess) or of ectopic ACTH syndrome (an ectopic source of ACTH excess). If corticorelin injection results in an increase of plasma ACTH and cortisol, the patient is diagnosed with Cushing's disease. However, if corticorelin injection does not result in an increase of plasma ACTH and cortisol, the patient is diagnosed with ectopic ACTH syndrome.In normal subjects, intravenous administration of corticorelin results in a rapid and sustained increase of plasma ACTH levels and a near parallel increase of plasma cortisol. In addition, intravenous administration of corticorelin to normal subjects causes a concomitant and prolonged release of the related proopiomelanocortin peptides Î²- and Î³-lipotropins (Î² -and Î³-LPH) and Î²-endorphin (Î² -END).Corticorelin is a potent stimulator of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) release from the anterior pituitary."
1657,DB09068,"Vortioxetine is indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD).Vortioxetine is an antidepressant medication indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). More specifically, vortioxetine acts via the following biological mechanisms: as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) through inhibition of the serotonin transporter, as a partial agonist of the 5-HT1B receptor, an agonist of 5-HT1A, and an antagonist of the 5-HT3, 5-HT1D, and 5-HT7 receptors. Some serotonin receptors seem to play a relatively neutral or insignificant role in the regulation of mood, but others, such as 5-HT1A autoreceptors and 5-HT7 receptors, appear to play an oppositional role in the efficacy of SRIs in treating depression.Vortioxetine binds with high affinity to the human serotonin transporter (Ki=1.6 nM), but not to the norepinephrine (Ki=113 nM) or dopamine (Ki>1000 nM) transporters. Vortioxetine potently and selectively inhibits reuptake of serotonin by inhibition of the serotonin transporter (IC50=5.4 nM). Specifically, vortioxetine binds to 5Â­HT3 (Ki=3.7 nM), 5Â­HT1A (Ki=15 nM), 5Â­HT7 (Ki=19 nM), 5Â­HT1D (Ki=54 nM), and 5Â­HT1B (Ki=33 nM), receptors and is a 5Â­HT3, 5Â­HT1D, and 5Â­HT7 receptor antagonist, 5Â­HT1B receptor partial agonist, and 5Â­HT1A receptor agonist.Vortioxetine is classified as a serotonin modulator and simulator (SMS) as it has a multimodal mechanism of action towards the serotonin neurotransmitter system whereby it simultaneously modulates one or more serotonin receptors and inhibits the reuptake of serotonin."

Typical, drugs that treat post-menopausal symptoms such as estrogen, have a proliferative effect on the endometrium, increasing the risk of endometrial carcinoma . The effects on the bone, brain and vaginal tissues can be explained by the estrogenic activity of tibolone. Breast tissue of monkeys is not found to be stimulated after tibolone administration,  as occurs with estrogen plus progesterone used in combination. In a study of monkeys, breast tissue was not stimulated, which occurs with estrogen and progesterone, because tibolone and its metabolites inhibit _sulfatase and 17 beta-hydroxysteroid _dehydrogenase (HSD) type I and stimulate _sulfotransferase and 17 beta-HSD type II_."

1664,DB09075,"However, it should not be used in patients with creatinine clearance (CrCL) > 95 mL/min because of increased risk of ischemic stroke compared to warfarin at the highest dose studied (60 mg). By inhibiting factor Xa, a key protein in the coagulation cascade, edoxaban prevents the stepwise amplification of protein factors needed to form blood clots. It is indicated to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism (SE) in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) following 5-10 days of initial therapy with a parenteral anticoagulant. Traditionally, warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, was used for stroke prevention in these individuals but effective use of this drug is limited by it's delayed onset, narrow therapeutic window, need for regular monitoring and INR testing, and numerous drug-drug and drug-food interactions. This has prompted enthusiasm for newer agents such as dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban for effective clot prevention."

In particular, VEGF has been identified as a crucial regulator of both physiologic and pathologic angiogenesis and increased expression of VEGF is associated with a poor prognosis in many types of cancers. However, for patients with RAI-refractory thyroid cancer, treatment options are limited and the prognosis is poor, leading to a push for the development of more targeted therapies such as lenvatinib.Based on x-ray crystallography and kinetic interaction studies, lenvatinib binds to the adenosine 5'-triphosphate binding site of VEGFR2 and to a neighbouring region via a cyclopropane ring and thereby inhibits tyrosine kinase activity and associated signalling pathways. Lenvatinib also inhibits other RTKs that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular functions, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4; the platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRÎ±), KIT, and RET."
1668,DB09079,"In the EU, under the brand name Vargatef, nintedanib is indicated in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic, locally advanced, or locally recurrent non-small cell lung cancer of adenocarcinoma histology who have already tried first-line therapy.Nintedanib is a small molecule kinase inhibitor used in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis, systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It was first approved for use in the United States in 2014. Within the spectrum of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis treatment options, nintedanib is currently one of only two disease-modifying therapies available and indicated for the condition (the other being ) and as such is  used as a first-line treatment following diagnosis to slow down the progressive loss of lung function. As a chemotherapeutic agent for NSCLC, nintedanib, in combination with , is reserved for patients who have tried and failed first-line chemotherapeutic options.Nintedanib is a small molecule kinase inhibitor that inhibits upstream kinase activity to ultimately inhibit lung fibroblast proliferation and migration, as well as signalling pathways that promote the proliferation and survival of endothelial and perivascular cells in tumour tissues. Nintedanib poses a risk of drug-induced liver injury, especially within the first three months of therapy."
1669,DB09080,"It is not indicated for the treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD or for the treatment of asthma.Olodaterol is a novel, long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA) that exerts its pharmacological effect by binding and activating beta2-adrenergic receptors located primarily in the lungs. Activation of the receptor stimulates an associated G protein which then activates adenylate cyclase, catalyzing the formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and protein kinase A (PKA). Treatment with bronchodilators helps to mitigate associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough, and sputum production. Despite similarities in symptoms, olodaterol is not indicated for the treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD or for the treatment of asthma.Olodaterol is a potent agonist of the human beta2-adrenergic receptor in vitro, and is highly selective for this receptor, with much lower levels of activity at the b1- and b3-adrenergic receptors that are commonly expressed on cardiac smooth muscle and adipose tissue, respectively. Binding to the receptor causes smooth muscle relaxation in the lungs and bronchodilation."
1670,DB09081,"Idebenone is indicated for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of visual impairment in adolescent and adult patients with  Leberâs Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON). It is not currently approved for use by either the Food and Drug Administration (USA) or Health Canada .Idebenone is a synthetic analogue of ubiquinone (also known as Coenzyme Q10), a vital cell antioxidant and essential component of the Electron Transport Chain (ETC). It has been proposed that by interacting with the ETC, idebenone increases ATP production required for mitochondrial function, reduces free radicals, inhibits lipid peroxidation, and consequently protects the lipid membrane and mitochondria from oxidative damage . Due to its ability to reduce oxidative damage and improve ATP production, idebenone was originally investigated for its potential use in Alzheimer's Disease and other cognitivie disorders . Due to its biochemical mode of action, it's thought that idebenone may re-activate viable-but-inactive retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in LHON patients ."
1671,DB09082,"Approved by the FDA in 2013, the use of Breo Ellipta is indicated for the long-term, once-daily maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with COPD, including chronic bronchitis and emphysema, as well as the once-daily maintenance treatment of asthma in patients aged 18 or older with reversible obstructive airways disease. Anoro Ellipta is indicated for the maintenance treatment of patients with COPD, and Trelegy Ellipta is indicated for the maintenance treatment of patients with COPD as well as the maintenance treatment of asthma in patients aged 18 years and older.Vilanterol is a selective long-acting Î²2-adrenergic agonist (LABA) with inherent 24-hour activity for the once-daily treatment of COPD and asthma. This is in response to the need for longer-acting Î²2-adrenergic agonists to overcome poor patient compliance (due to the frequency of dosing regimens or complexities of drug administration). Vilanterol was designed based on the salmeterol molecular scaffold, particularly as a  antedrug analog of salmeterol modification by modifying the salmeterol molecule to create homochiral compounds with the (R)-configuration. Vilanterol is 1000 and 400 fold more selective for Î²2 than Î²1 and Î²3 adrenoceptors, respectively, with a faster onset of action than salmeterol."
1672,DB09083,"Ivabradine is indicated by the FDA to reduce the risk of hospitalization for worsening heart failure in adult patients with stable, symptomatic chronic heart failure with left ventricular ejection fraction â¤35%, who are in sinus rhythm with resting heart rate â¥70 beats per minute and either are on maximally tolerated doses of beta-blockers or have a contraindication to beta-blocker use. It is also indicated for treatment of stable symptomatic heart failure as a result of dilated cardiomyopathy for pediatric patients 6 months of age or more.Ivabradine is a novel heart rate lowering medicine for the symptomatic management of stable angina pectoralis and symptomatic chronic heart failure. Ivabradine acts by selectively inhibiting the ""funny"" channel pacemaker current (If) in the sinoatrial node in a dose-dependent fashion, resulting in a lower heart rate and thus more blood to flow to the myocardium. Therefore, as ivabradine is designed as a ""pure"" heart rate-lowering drug by selectively acting on the If channels, it may offer a more favorable side effect profile due to its lower likelihood of causing serious adverse effects.The funny channels (If) open during repolarization and close during depolarization, making ivabradine's activity dependent on heart rate or the closing and opening of the channels. This allows for an improved oxygen supply and therefore mitigation of ischemia, allowing for a higher exercise capacity and reduction in angina episodes."
1673,DB09084,"When formulated as a mouthwash or spray, benzydamine may be used to treat traumatic conditions like pharyngitis following tonsillectomy or the use of a naso-gastric tube, inflammatory conditions like pharyngitis, aphthous ulcers and oral ulceration due to radiation therapy, dentistry operations and procedures, or more general conditions like sore throat, sore tongue, sore gums, mouth ulcers, or discomfort caused by dentures. It is used topically for pain relief and anti-inflammatory treatment of the mouth, throat, or muscoskeletal system. Moreover, unlike aspirin-like NSAIDs which are acids or metabolised to acids, benzydamine is in fact a weak base.Benzydamine is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) designed to elicit local anesthetic and analgesic effects mainly for the mouth and throat. Furthermore, benzydamine is capable of a local anaesthetic effect that may be related to its capability for inhibiting the release of inflammatory mediators like substance P and calcitonin gene related peptide from sensory nerve endings. Benzydamine also demonstrates a non-specific antibacterial activity against various bacterial strains that are resistant to broad-spectrum antibiotics such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline at concentrations of about 3 mmol/L."

Potassium alum is formed by large, transparent crystals that are used in different products like food or drugs as a buffer, neutralizing or forming agent.The presence of potassium alum reduces swollen mucous membranes that result from inflammation of the nasal, gastrointestinal and urinary passages as well as in the presence of excessive secretions. The induction of the coagulation cascade will also stop bleeding.The main functions of potassium alum in drugs are as an astringent, antiseptic or adjuvant agent. The astringent action is performed by the induction of coagulation in the superficial tissue layers until the formation of a crust."
1676,DB09089,"Trimebutine is a spasmolytic agent that regulates intestinal and colonic motility and relieves abdominal pain with antimuscarinic and weak mu opioid agonist effects. At higher concentrations (100-300uM), reduced amplitude of spontaneous contractions and action potentials is thought to be mediated by inhibition of L-type Ca2+ channels and inward calcium current . Trimebutine mediates a local anesthetic action by acting as a weak agonist at mu opioid receptors.At high concentrations, trimebutine is shown to inhibit the extracellular Ca2+ influx in the smooth muscle cells through voltage dependent L-type Ca2+ channels and further Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ stores . It also inhibits outward K+ currents in response to membrane depolarization of the GI smooth muscle cells at resting conditions through inhibition of delayed rectifier K+ channels and Ca2+ dependent K+ channels, which results in induced muscle contractions . Trimebutine binds to mu opioid receptors with more selectivity compared to delta or kappa opioid receptors but with lower affinity than their natural ligands."
1677,DB09090,"It is a quaternary ammonium compound that acts as an atypical calcium antagonist to restore normal bowel function. It is shown to relieve GI spasm and pain, transit disturbances and other symptoms related to motility disorders  and may be considered as effective first-lline therapy for patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) . Although it is not a currently approved drug by the FDA, pinaverium is available in over 60 countries including Canada.Pinaverium is a selective and specific voltage-dependent calcium channel blocker located on intestinal smooth muscle cells to inhibit calcium influx.

1678,DB09091,"Tixocortol is indicated for the treatment of rhinitis as a nasal suspension or aerosol. It is also used in the form of lozenges for the treatment of pharyngitis and in the form of enemas or rectal solution for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. It is also the substance used for the screening of contact allergies to class A steroids.Tixocortol is a 21-thiol derivative of hydrocortisone classified as a class A corticosteroid. It is a synthetic steroid with topical anti-inflammatory properties without the systemic glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid activities and toxicity.Tixocortol presents the characteristic of local action which reduces significantly the side effects of systemic glucocorticoids. All the effects were independent of suppression of the pituitary-adrenal axis, which was shown by the absence of significant depression of cortisol."
1679,DB09092,"Xanthinol is primarily used in diet supplements to increase the brain metabolism of glucose and obtain ATP. Xanthinol is also used as an agent to reduced cholesterol as it is a vasodilator. Its action allows having an elevated rate of blood flow in the brain which helps improve memory function, concentration and awareness. Xaninthol is known to be a potent vasodilator that can easily pass through the cell membrane and once inside the cell it causes an increase in glucose metabolism resulting in an increased energy. The later effect is explained by the enhancing on the cell metabolism and oxygen supply in the brain by the rise of ATP in erythrocytes which allows penetration into capillaries easier and a higher oxygen pressure in the capillary blood which improves oxygenation of surrounding tissue.The positively charged xanthinol ion is thought to help the transportation of the nicotinic acid into the cell since the later cannot freely diffuse through the cell membrane."
1680,DB09093,"Used in the manufacuring of medicated animal feeds .Chlortetracycline is a tetracycline antibiotic, and historically the first member of this class to be identified. It was discovered in 1945 by the scientist, Benjamin Minge Duggar, working at Lederle Laboratories under the supervision of Yellapragada Subbarow. He discovered that this antibiotic was the product of an actinomycete strain he cultured and obtained from a soil sample from a field in Missouri. The organism was named Streptomyces aureofaciens due to its gold-hued color.Tetracycline antibiotics are bacteriostatic agents which act to inhibit bacterial growth and reproduction .Chlortetracycline, like other tetracyclines, competes for the A site of the bacterial ribosome . This binding competes with tRNA carrying amino acids preventing the addition of more amino acids to the peptide chain."

Topical benzoyl peroxide is also indicated for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea in adults.L33314] After administration, the peroxide bond is cleaved, allowing benzoyloxy radicals to nonspecifically interact with proteins. Acne is generally caused by increased excretion of sebum from pilosebaceous glands, endocrine factors such as androgenic hormones, keratin developing around follicles, bacterial growth, and inflammation. Over time, free radical interactions with bacterial proteins lead to decreased keratin and sebum around follicles. Benzoyl peroxide can also increase the turnover rate of epithelial cells, leading to skin peeling, and breaking down comedones."
1683,DB09097,"Indicated for the treatment of hyperprolactinemia (idiopathic or originating from a prolactin-secreting pituitary microadenoma or macroadenoma).Quinagolide is a non-ergot-derived selective dopamine D2 receptor agonist used for the treatment of elevated levels of prolactin or hyperprolactinaemia. Hyperprolalctinaemia is associated with gonadal dysfunction, including infertility and reduced libido, as well as long-term complications such as osteoporosis . Newer dopamine receptor agonists such as quinagolide and  are shown to effectively inhibit prolactin secretion with improved efficacy over . It potently suppresses both basal and stimulated serum prolactin levels by exerting a strong inhibitory effect on the secretion of the anterior pituitary hormone prolactin.Prolactin secretion from the lactotroph cells present in the anterior pituiatry gland is under tonic inhibitory control mediated by dopaminergic signalling via D2 receptors . Quinagolide selectively binds to D2 receptors expressed on the surface of lactotroph cells with high affinity which results in reduced adenylyl cyclase activity, reduced intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate and inhibited prolactin secretion."
1684,DB09098,"Paediatric patients who lack adequate endogenous growth hormone secretion, patients with chronic kidney disease, and patients with Turner syndrome that were treated with somatrem resulted in an increase in growth rate and an increase in insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) levels similar to that seen with patients who possess endogenous pituitary derived hGH . With normalized levels of growth hormone and related mediator agents like IGF-1, patients demonstrate normalized skeletal, cell, organ, and overall tissue growth .Somatrem - as well as endogenous growth hormone - binds to dimeric growth hormone (GH) receptors located within the cell membranes of target tissue cells resulting in intracellular signal transduction and a host of pharmacodynamic effects . Skeletal growth is accomplished at the epiphyseal plates at the ends of growing bone . Serum levels of IGF-I are low in children and adolescents who are growth hormone deficient, but increase during somatrem treatment . Serum levels of inorganic phosphorus may increase slightly in patients with inadequate secretion of endogenous GH, chronic kidney disease, or Turner syndrome during somatrem therapy due to metabolic activity associated with bone growth as well as increased tubular reabsorption of phosphate by the kidney ."
1685,DB09099,"It is secreted by the D cells of the islets to inhibit the release of insulin and glucagon, and is also generated in the hypothalamus, where it inhibits the release of growth hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormones from the anterior pituitary . is a long-acting analogue of somatostatin that inhibits the release of a number of hormones, and is clinically used to relieve symptoms of uncommon gastroenteropancreatic endocrine tumours, as well as treat acromegaly .Somatostatin is an endogenous peptide hormone that is secreted by the central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, retina, peripheral neurons and pancreatic D cells of the islets of Langerhans. While distribution of two active isoforms of somatostatin is similar, SST-14 is more predominant in the enteric neurons and peripheral nerves whereas SST-28 is more prominent in the retina and intestinal mucosal cells . By binding to SST2 receptors, somatostatin exerts paracrine inhibitory actions on gastrin release from G cells, histamine release from ECL cells, and directly on parietal cell acid output . The antitumor effects of somatostatin were also effective in various malignant lymphomas and breast tumours ."

It is a 166 amino acid protein produced by E. coli with an amino acid sequence that is identical to the natural sequence predicted from human DNA sequence analysis, except for the addition of an N-terminal methionine. Ancestim was developed by Amgen and sold to Biovitrium in December 2008. It was also approved by Health Canada in 1999 but it is currently under the status of canceled post-market.Ancestim action on hemotopeitic progenitor cells stimulates its proliferation, differentiation, commitment and functional activation. Ancestim alone is unable to increase peripheral blood progenitor cells so it has to be administered with filgastrim, a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor."
1690,DB09104,"As an antacid, it is used for the temporary relief of heartburn, upset stomach, sour stomach or acid indigestion. It can also be used topically as a deodorant or for the relief of canker sores (aphthous ulcers).As an antacid, magnesium hydroxide suspension neutralizes gastric acid by reacting with hydrochloric acid in the stomach to form magnesium chloride and water. It is practically insoluble in water and does not have any effect until it reacts with the hydrochloric acid in the stomach. According to the amount ingested, the magnesium hydroxide will either act as an antacid or a laxative. Magnesium hydroxide will also release cholecystokinin (CKK) in the intestines which will accumulate water and electrolytes in the lumen and furthermore increase intestinal motility."
1691,DB09105,"Asfotase alfa is a first-in-class bone-targeted enzyme replacement therapy designed to address the underlying cause of hypophosphatasia (HPP)âdeficient alkaline phosphatase (ALP). The annual average price of Asfotase Alfa treatment is $285,000.Perinatal/infantile- and juvenile-onset HPP patients treated with Asfotase alfa had reductions in plasma TNSALP (tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase) substrates, PPi and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) within 6 to 12 weeks of treatment. Bone biopsy data from perinatal/infantile-onset and juvenile-onset HPP patients treated with Asfotase alfa demonstrated decreases in osteoid volume and thickness indicating improved bone mineralization. HPP is caused by a deficiency in TNSALP (tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase) enzyme activity, which leads to elevations in several TNSALP substrates, including inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi). Replacement of the TNSALP enzyme upon Asfotase alfa treatment reduces the enzyme substrate levels."

Not a substitute for RBC transfusion if immediate correction of anemia is required.Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta is a chemically synthesised Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agent (ESA) with a longer half-life than erythropoietin. ESA is used to increase synthesis of red blood cells to  treat chronic kidney disease associated anemia.Stimulates hemoglobin production by stimulating the erythropoetin receptor of erythroid progenitor cells in the bone marrow. Hemoglobin increase, following a single initial dose, occurs 7 to 15 days after.Erythropoietin is a growth factor for erythroid development. Production of endogenous erythropoietin is impaired in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and erythropoietin deficiency is the primary cause of their anaemia."
1694,DB09109,"Hemophilia A is a hereditary hemorrhagic disorder generated by the congenital deficit of the coagulation factor VIII. The coagulation factor VIII is a robust initiator of thrombin which is later required for the generation of fibrin to form a platelet plug and its gene is expressed in the X chromosome.Turoctocog alfa is a recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) with a truncated B-domain made from the sequence coding for 10 amino acids from the N-terminus and 11 amino acids from the C-terminus of the naturally occurring B-domain. All these studies prove that turoctocog alfa is fully functional and its activity is similar to the one showed by other recombinant factor VIII products.The B domain is known to perform the function of restrict the expression of the endogenous coagulation factor VIII but it has no direct relationship to the function of this factor. In normal conditions during hemostasis, the coagulation factor VIII will be activated by specific thrombin cleavages producing A1, A2 and A3-C1-C2 fragments of activated factor VIII (Factor VIIIa) which will form a complex with the factor IXa and activate the factor X leading to a stable haemostatic plug. This recombinant structure allows it to replace the missing factor VIII and restore hemostasis."

Cyanide binds to and inhibits cytochrome oxidase a3, preventing oxidative phophorylation from occuring. The resultant lack of ATP cannot support normal cellular processes, particularly in the brain. The now oxidized Fe3+ in methemoglobin also binds cyanide with high affinity and accepts cyanide from cytochrome a3. The reduction of nitrite by hemoglobin results in the formation of nitric oxide ."
1697,DB09113,Poractant alfa is indicated for the treatment of Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) in premature infants.Poractant alfa is a pulmonary surfactant marketed as Curosurf in the United States and Canada. Poractant alfa is an extract of natural porcine lung surfactant consisting of 99% polar lipids (mainly phospholipids) and 1% hydrophobic low molecular weight proteins (surfactant associated proteins SP-B and SP-C). The phospholipid content of the extract consists primarily of phosphatidylcholine and dipaImitoylphosphatidylcholine. A deficiency of pulmonary surfactant in premature infants allows surface tension to increase to the point where sections of lung collapse and respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) develops. This compensates for the lack of endogenous surfactant and restores adequate surface activity to the lungs.
1698,DB09116,"This medication was marketed in Canada, United Kingdom and Europe under the trade name of Temposil for the sole use of alcoholism treatment.Calcium carbimide, sold as the citrate salt, is an alcohol-sensitizing agent. Its effects are similar to the drug disulfiram (Antabuse) in that it interferes with the normal metabolism of alcohol by preventing the breakdown of the metabolic product acetaldehyde. Calcium carbimide was conceived as an alternative for the treatment of alcoholism with a reduced side effect profile either when it is consumed accompanied by alcohol or without it. The current status of calcium carbimide is cancelled post marketing.Administration of calcium carbimide causes a syndrome characterized by intense flushing, rapid pulse, panting respiration and perception of acetaldehyde in the exhaled breath. This syndrome remains for a few hours after alcohol consumption and it stops completeley after 24 hours."
1699,DB09117,"Paraldehyde was used historically as a sedative and hypnotic . It has been used in the treatment of seizures as an anticonvulsant .Paraldehyde was initially introduced into medical practice in the United Kingdom in 1882 by the Italian physician Vincenzo Cervello. It is classified as a central nervous system (CNS) depressant and has also been found to be an effective anticonvulsant, hypnotic and sedative agent due to its CNS depressant properties. Paraldehyde is used as an ingredient in some cough medicines as an expectorant, but its efficacy for this indication has not been confirmed and its use as an expectorant may possibly be due to a placebo effect.Paraldehyde blocks neuromuscular transmission .Paraldehyde is believed to reduce the release of acetylcholine in response to neuronal depolarization . The exact mechanism of this effect is unknown."
1700,DB09118,"In Europe and Canada, stiripentol is indicated for use as adjunctive therapy to refractory generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients with Dravet syndrome in infancy whose seizures are not adequately controlled with clobazam and valproate alone.Stiripentol is an antiepileptic agent that is an aromatic allylic alcohol drug, which makes it structurally unique from other antiepileptic drugs. However, its clinical efficacy as adjunctive therapy for epilepsies stems from its inhibitory action on CYP enzymes, as stiripentol reduces the degradation of CYP-sensitive antiepileptic drugs, hence boosting their therapeutic efficacy. Stiripentol may also exhibit direct anticonvulsant properties, although the exact mechanism of action is fully understood. Stiripentol is an inhibitor of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which is involved in the energy metabolism of neurons and regulation of neuronal excitation. The drug binds to the site separate from the enzyme's lactate and pyruvate binding sites, thereby inhibiting both pyruvate-to-lactate conversion and lactate-to-pyruvate conversion."
1701,DB09119,"Eslicarbazepine's mechanism of action is not well understood, but it is known that it does exert anticonvulsant activity by inhibiting repeated neuronal firing and stabilizing the inactivated state of voltage-gated sodium channels, thus preventing their return to the activated state during which seizure activity can occur. Eslicarbazepine acetate is marketed as Aptiom in North America and Zebinix or Exalief in Europe. It is available in 200, 400, 600, or 800mg tablets that are taken once daily, with or without food. It is recommended that patients taking eslicarbazepine acetate be monitored for suicidality.Eslicarbazepine acetate is associated with a dose- and concentration-dependant increase in heart rate and prolongation of PR interval.Eslicarbazepine acetate is converted to the active metabolite eslicarbazepine which carries out its anticonvulsant activity. In in vitro electrophysiological studies, eslicarbazepine was shown to inhibit repeated neuronal firing by stabilizing the inactivated state of voltage-gated sodium channels and preventing their return to the activated state."
1702,DB09120,"Zucapsaicin, the cis-isomer of capsaicin, is a topical analgesic used to treat osteoarthritis of the knee and other neuropathic pain. Zucapsaicin was approved by the Health Canada in 2010 as topical cream marketed under the brand name Zuacta but currently not FDA-approved.Zucapsaicin mediates an antinociceptive action via acting as an agonist at TRPV1. They are mainly distributed in C sensory nerve fibers as well as Aáº fibers to transmit sensory information involving inflammatory and neuropathic pain, and activation of these channels releasesomatostatin, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and other neuropeptides (neurokinin A, kassinin), leading to neurogenic inflammation . Activation of TRPV1 results in calcium influx and sodium, which leads to cell depolarization. Studies suggest that zucapsaicin is involved in activation of phospholipase C with the subsequent phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) hydrolysis, which results in TRPV1 inactivation ."
1703,DB09121,"Aurothioglucose is indicated for the adjunctive treatment of early active adult and juvenile type rheumatoid arthritis that is not adequately controlled by other anti-inflammatory agents and conservative measures like salicylate, glucocorticoids, etc. In chronic, advanced cases of rheumatoid arthritis, such gold therapy is not demonstrated to be as valuable . Antirheumatic measures such as salicylate and other anti-inflammatory drugs (both steroidal and non steroidal) may be continued after initiation of gold therapy . Many if not most gold compounds that were indicated for rheumatoid arthritis therapy have since been replaced with the use of various current disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) like methotrexate and others, which are far more effective.After administration, patient serum levels of gold rise sharply but decline over the following week . These attacks are facilitated by various pro-inflammatory immune cells and agents like cytokines, histamines, mast cells, macrophages, monocytes, lymphocytes, leukocytes, and many others ."
1704,DB09122,"Peginterferon beta-1a is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of MS, including relapsing-remitting disease, clinically isolated syndrome, and active progressive secondary disease.Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic and inflammatory autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, disrupting communication between the brain and other parts of the body. Symptoms may include but are not limited to fatigue, gait changes, bowel or bladder dysfunction, abnormal muscle twitching, vision disturbance, and depressing or mood swings. Currently, it is the only approved pegylated interferon for the management of MS with an proven ability to reduce relapses and delay the progression of disability resulting from MS.Peginterferon beta-1a likely reduces MS relapses and the progression of disability and brain lesions associated with MS by reducing inflammation. The mechanism by which peginterferon beta-1a exerts its effects in patients with multiple sclerosis is unknown, however, it likely exerts its therapeutic actions by reducing inflammation. Through the binding of IFN-beta to its receptor, a cascade of transcriptional events occur, decreasing the inflammation that normally results in the progression of MS."
1705,DB09123,"Indicated for use as the treatment of endometriosis alone and as a contraceptive in combination with ethinylestradiol. Dienogest is an orally-active semisynthetic progestogen which also possesses the properties of 17Î±-hydroxyprogesterone. It is a derivative of 19-nortestosterone and has antiandrogenic properties. Dienogest displays no antiestrogenic activity as it activate neither estrogen receptor (ER) Î± nor ERÎ² , and causes hypoestrogenic effects instead as it is shown to decrease the relative expressions of ERÎ² and ERÎ± . It has no glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid effects.Dienogest acts as an agonist at the progesterone receptor (PR) with weak affinity that is comparable to that of progesterone but has a very potent progestagenic effect in the endometrium, causing endometrial atrophy after prolonged use ."

1707,DB09125,"For the management of renal tubular acidosis, hypocitraturic calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis, and uric acid lithiasis with or without calcium stones.Potassium citrate (also known as tripotassium citrate) is a potassium salt of citric acid. It is a white, hygroscopic crystalline powder. Citrate also inhibits the spontaneous nucleation of calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate.After oral administration of potassium citrate, its metabolism yields alkaline load. Potassium Citrate therapy appears to increase urinary citrate mainly by modifying the renal handling of citrate, rather than by increasing the filtered load of citrate. In addition to raising urinary pH and citrate, Potassium Citrate increases urinary potassium by approximately the amount contained in the medication."
1708,DB09128,"Brexpiprazole is also indicated for the treatment of agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimerâs disease; however, it is not indicated as an as-needed (âprnâ) treatment for this condition.Brexpiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic and a novel D2 dopamine and serotonin 1A partial agonist called serotonin-dopamine activity modulator (SDAM). Currently approved for the treatment of depression, schizophrenia, and agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimerâs disease, brexpiprazole has also been investigated in other psychiatric disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder.Brexpiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic agent used to ameliorate the symptoms of psychiatric conditions, such as cognitive deficits and affective symptoms. Brexpiprazole acts as a partial agonist at the 5-HT1A, D2, and D3 receptors and as an antagonist at 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT7, Î±1A, Î±1B, Î±1D, and Î±2C receptors. Brexpiprazole also exhibits affinity for histamine H1 receptor (19 nM) and for muscarinic M1 receptor (67% inhibition at 10 ÂµM).Although the exact mechanism of action of brexpiprazole in psychiatric disorders has not been fully elucidated, the efficacy of brexpiprazole may be attributed to combined partial agonist activity at 5-HT1A and dopamine D2 receptors, and antagonist activity at 5-HT2A receptors. Antagonism at Î±-adrenergic receptors has also been implicated in schizophrenia and depression."

Gadoterate meglumine has one of the highest thermodynamic stability, apparent stability, and kinetic stability, partly due to its macrocyclic structure, and thus has a more favorable safety profile due to a decreased tendency of gadolinium dechelation. Gadoterate is approved by the FDA under the brand name DOTAREM on 20th March 2013 for intravenous uses with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the brain (intracranial), spine, and associated tissues in adult and pediatric patients (2 years of age and older) to detect and visualize areas with disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and/or abnormal vascularity.Gadoterate affects proton relaxation times and consequently the MR signal, and the contrast obtained is characterized by  the relaxivity of the gadoterate molecule. The relaxivity values for gadoterate are similar across the spectrum of magnetic  field strengths used in clinical MRI (0.2-1.5 T). Disruption of the blood-brain barrier or abnormal vascularity allows the distribution of gadoterate in lesions such as neoplasms, abscesses, and infarcts."

1716,DB09137,"Technetium Tc 99m Mebrofenin is indicated as a hepatobiliary imaging agent.Technetium Tc 99m Mebrofenin is a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical composed of diisopropyl-iminodiacetic acid (DISIDA)  attached to a technetium-99m ion. Following intravenous injection, single photon emission computer tomography (SPECT) imaging of the liver or gallbladder is performed using a gamma camera to detect the gamma rays emitted by the technetium-99m as it decays. This is possible as Technetium-99m decays by isomeric transition to technetium-99 through the release of a gamma ray. Liver and gallbladder imaging is enabled through attachment to mebrofenin as this molecule has high hepatic uptake and fast biliary excretion, resulting in improved hepatic imaging. More specifically, mebrofenin is taken up into hepatocytes through the action of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 transporters."
1717,DB09139,Technetium Tc-99m oxidronate is indicated in adult and pediatric patients to be used in skeletal imaging for diagnosis of areas that can present altered osteogenesis. The radiopharmaceuticals based on technetium-99m are widely used for diagnostic purposes because 99mTc has a versatile chemistry which allows it to produce an extense variety of complexes with specific characteristics. The visualization of bone lesions is possible since there is an altered uptake in areas of abnormal osteogenesis. Its use for bone examination should be performed 2 hours after initial injection with a recommended activity on the range of 370-740 MBq.The exact mechanism for bone uptake of technetium Tc-99m oxidronate is unknown. The most accepted mechanism is the localization of 99m-Tc on the surface of hydroxyapatite crystals of bone by chemisorption.

It also has an affinity for red blood cells, enabling imaging of blood pools.It is thought that technetium Tc-99m pyrophosphate is adsorbed onto the surface of amorphous calcium phosphate deposits , insoluble hydroxyapatite crystals, and possibly other organic macromolecules. In areas of altered osteogenesis where hydroxyapatite formation is actively occuring, the surface area to volume ratio is high and favors a greater amount of technetium Tc-99m pyrophosphate to the surface of the crystals than in other areas of bone where crystal formation is less active. The localization of technetium Tc-99m pyrophosphate to these areas allows for their specific radioimaging."
1729,DB09167,"Indicated in the treatment of symptoms of depressive illness, especially where an anti-anxiety effect is required.Dosulepin (INN, BAN) formerly known as dothiepin (USAN), is a tricyclic antidepressant with anxiolytic properties that is used in several European and South Asian countries, as well as Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand. The metabolites of dosulepin are shown to inhibit 5HT uptake by the human blood platelet .By binding to noradrenaline transporter (NAT) and serotonin transporter (SERT) in an equipotent manner and inhibiting the reuptake activity, dosulepin increases the free levels of noradrenaline and 5HT at the synaptic cleft. It is shown that the main metabolite northiaden is a more potent inhibitor of noradrenaline uptake than the parent drug . Dosulepin binds to 5HT1A and 5HT2A receptors in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus as an antagonist.

1730,DB09183,"Dasabuvir is indicated for the treatment of patients with HCV genotype 1a with  or genotype 1b without  including those with compensated cirrhosis .Dasabuvir is a direct acting antiviral medication used as part of combination therapy to treat chronic Hepatitis C, an infectious liver disease caused by infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). Dasabuvir is a non-nucleoside NS5B inhibitor which binds to the palm domain of NS5B and induces a conformational change which renders the polymerase unable to elongate viral RNA . Based on drug resistance mapping studies of HCV genotypes 1a and 1b, dasabuvir targets the palm domain of the NS5B polymerase, and is therefore referred to as a non-nucleoside NS5B-palm polymerase inhibitor. By binding to NS5b outside of the active site of the enzyme, dasabuvir induces a conformational change thereby preventing further elongation of the nascent viral genome . A limitation of binding outside of the active site is that these binding sites are poorly preserved across the viral genotypes."
1731,DB09185,"For decades, an immediate-release formulation of viloxazine has been used in Europe as an antidepressant. In April 2021, an extended-release formulation of viloxazine under the brand name QELBREE was approved by the FDA for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).Viloxazine is a serotonin-norepinephrine modulating agent that has been used as a treatment for depression and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). There is conflicting evidence in the literature that viloxazine increases dopamine levels in the brain via direct or indirect effects. For example, the norepinephrine transporter is also involved in the reuptake of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex  and stimulation of 5-HT2C receptors facilitates DA release and enhances dopaminergic transmission in the brain. As dopamine dysregulation in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala is implicated in ADHD pathophysiology, the impact of viloxazine on dopamine levels may contribute to its mechanism of action."
1732,DB09195,"In 2016, lorpiprazole was classified in the ""Chemical structure-related drug-like criteria of global approved drugs"" as an antipsychotic and anxiolytic. The anxiety state can be defined as an unpleasant state of tension, apprehension or uneasiness.Lorpiprazole is a serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor used for the treatment of major depressive disorder. It is a piperazinyl-triazole derivative.Drugs like lorpiprazole that fit in the category of serotonin antagonists and reuptake inhibitors present a wide variety of effects when administered. They inhibit serotonin receptors like 5-HT2A as well as prevent the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine. This diverse functional profile allows lorpiprazole to have a large therapeutic spectrum from symptom control as an adjuvant of other drugs to control of depressive syndromes as a monotherapy.Lorpiprazole is a serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor thus, its activity is performed by antagonizing the 5-HT2A and the 5-HT2C serotoninergic receptors as well as the alpha1 and alpha2 adrenergic receptors, H1 histaminergic receptors and at high doses, inhibiting the SERT serotonin transporter."

ANP and BNP are released under atrial and ventricle stress, which activate downstream receptors leading to vasodilation, natriuresis and diuresis. Inhibition of neprilysin therefore leads to reduced breakdown and increased concentration of endogenous natriuretic peptides in addition to increased levels of vasoconstricting hormones such as angiotensin II.n a 7-day valsartan-controlled study in patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), administration of sacubitril + valsartan (Entresto) resulted in a significant non-sustained increase in natriuresis, increased urine cGMP, and decreased plasma MR-proANP and NT-proBNP compared to valsartan. Therefore, the inhibition of neprilysin leads to reduced breakdown and increased concentration of endogenous natriuretic peptides in addition to increased levels of vasoconstricting hormones such as angiotensin II. Cardiovascular and renal effects of sacubitril is a result of the increased levels of peptides that are normally degraded by neprilysin."

PCSK9 is a protein that targets LDL receptors for degradation, therefore reducing the liver's ability to remove LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), or ""bad"" cholesterol, from the blood. Individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia often may have ""gain of function"" mutations in the PCSK9 molecules in their body, resulting in increased LDL-C plasma levels and a consequent cardiovascular risk. The mAb1 molecule binds on the catalytic site of PCSK9 next to the binding site for the LDL receptor and creates hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, resulting in the steric inhibition of binding between PCSK9 and the LDL receptor. Because the formation of complexes between LDL receptor and PCSK9 are prevented, the internalized LDL receptors are less likely to be degrated by lysosomes and may recycle to the surface of the cell to serve their function of removing LDL from the blood."

1832,DB09502,"The uptake of 18F-FDG by tissues is a marker for the tissue uptake of glucose, which in turn is closely correlated with certain types of tissue metabolism. In cancer, the cells are generally characterized by enhanced glucose metabolism partially due to (1) an increase in the activity of glucose transporters, (2) an increased rate of phosphorylation activity, (3) a reduction of phosphatase activity or, (4) a dynamic alteration in the balance among all these  processes. However, under ischemic conditions, the oxidation of free fatty acids decreases, exogenous glucose becomes the preferred myocardial substrate, glycolysis is stimulated, and glucose taken up by the myocyte is metabolized immediately instead of being converted into glycogen. Under these conditions, phosphorylated Fludeoxyglucose F 18 accumulates in the myocyte and can be detected with PET imaging. In comparison to background activity of the specific organ or tissue type, regions of decreased or absent uptake of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 reflect the decrease or absence of glucose metabolism."

1859,DB10805,"Greater risk is associated with living in or traveling to areas of South America and Africa where yellow fever infection is officially reported at the time of travel and with traveling outside the urban areas of countries that do not officially report the disease but that lie in a yellow fever endemic zone. Persons Travelling Internationally Through Countries with Yellow Fever: Some countries require an individual to have a valid International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis (ICVP) if the individual has been in countries either known or thought to harbor yellow fever virus. The certificate becomes valid 10 days after vaccination with Yellow Fever Vaccine. The World Health Organization recommends routine vaccination in countries where Yellow Fever is endemic, and for travellers going to endemic areas as proof of vaccination is often a requirement at border crossings to prevent international spread of the disease . The FDA recommends vaccination with Yellow Fever Vaccine for persons living in or travelling to endemic areas and for laboratory personnel who handle virulent yellow fever virus or concentrated preparations of the yellow fever vaccine virus.Yellow Fever Vaccine is composed of two live, attenuated strains of yellow fever virus, 17D-204 and 17DD, which have been shown to elicit an immune response identical to that induced by wild-type infection ."
1860,DB10989,"Hepatitis A vaccine is indicated for immunization against hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection in patients aged 12 months and older, and the first dose should be administered at least 2 weeks before expected exposure to the Hepatitis A virus. Hepatitis A viral infection can lead to significant morbidity and mortality, with signs and symptoms that include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and liver failure. Known by several trade names, such as Havrix and Twinrix, the Hepatitis A vaccine has been formulated for immunization against hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection and safely confers strong protection against the disease caused by infection with this virus. In the US, the approved vaccine is inactivated while live Hepatitis A vaccines are currently available in other countries.Hepatitis A vaccine stimulates the immune-mediated production of anti-Hepatitis A antibodies, allowing for protection against Hepatitis A infection via the production of specific antibodies against the virus and other immune cells that prevent infection with Hepatitis A virus.The administration of the hepatitis A vaccine leads to immune activation of lymphocytes, which proceed to engulf the hepatitis A antigen, leading to the release of inflammatory mediators that stimulate  B and T cells to attack the viral antigen. Following this stimulation, the B cells and T cells then differentiate into memory cells, antibody-producing B cells, cytotoxic T cells, and helper T cells to provide immunity against infection with Hepatitis A."
1861,DB10990,"Indicated for active immunization in pediatric patients 15 months through 4 years of age as a booster dose for the prevention of invasive disease caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b.

Anthrax vaccine is a vaccine used for the pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis of disease in those at high risk of, suspected or confirmed exposure to *Bacillus anthracis*. It is subcutaneously or intramuscularly administered. It is derived from cell-free filtrates of microaerophilic cultures of an avirulent, nonencapsulated strain of Bacillus anthracis which are grown in a chemically defined protein-free medium. These vaccines are currently stored in the Strategic National Stockpile in preparation for an Anthrax terrorist attack or for pre-exposure prophylaxis of personnel going to specific arenas around the world.Limited information is available on the pharmacodynamics of the anthrax vaccine.The anthrax vaccine induces antibodies raised against PA that may contribute to protection by neutralizing the activities of the cytotoxic lethal toxin and edema toxin of Bacillus anthracis."
1863,DB11051,"As a replacement for lost dermal constituents in the aging or skin deformation process, treatment with autologous fibroblasts has shown to improve wrinkle and acne scar appearance than with placebo treatment . In a randomized multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in subjects with bilateral moderate to severe acne scarring, treatment of autologous fibroblast treatment was associated with a significant improvement in the appearance of acne scars without permanent adverse reactions .The mechanism of action of azficel-T, or autologous human fibroblasts, is not fully elucidated. These crosslinks prevent the removal of degraded collagen, leading to accumulation of collagen fragments within the extracellular matrix, and compromised structural and mechanical integrity of the dermis . Integrins that are expressed by the fibroblasts allow the cell to bind to collagen matrix and allow mechanical tension within fibroblasts and the collagenous matrix. In the presence of fragmented collagen, the fibroblasts lose attachment to the collagen matrix and collapse within the dermis and subsequently leads to reduced collagen production and increased production of MMPs ."
1864,DB11057,"Mineral oil is not considered an active pharmacological ingredient in pharmaceutical preparations and so has no official indication. It is typically present in topical formulations as an emollient and occlusive agent .Mineral oil, or paraffin oil, is a mixture of higher alkanes from a mineral source, such as petroleum. During the modern refining process, aromatics are reduced by solvent extraction, catalytic hydrotreating, or hydrocracking. Unrefined or mildly treated mineral oils are classified as Group 3 carcinogens by the World Health Organizations, as chronic exposure to these aromatics including alkylated polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAC) can lead to skin cancer. It is also used as a mild laxative for human or veterinary uses.Mineral oil blocks the loss of water from the skin allowing greater hydration of the epidermis .Mineral oil sits on the surface of the skin and in spaces between cells and provides a hydrophobic barrier ."

1867,DB11074,"Dimethicone is used as an anti-foaming agent, a hair and skin conditioner, and in the treatment of head lice and, as an anti-bloating/anti-flatulence agent , .Dimethicone is a silicone oil that is also known as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). A  study found that that the 100 % dimethicone product is a safe and highly effective head lice treatment for children and may serve as less toxic and less resistance-prone alternative to pesticide-containing products .This drug acts as a skin protectant by helping to treat and prevent minor skin irritation due to diaper rash and seals out moisture from the diaper area. In the treatment of head lice dimethicone 100, the respiratory systems of head lice are targeted. The physical properties of this drug, including the viscosity and spreading property of the solution allow it to easily flow into the respiratory system of all developmental stages of the insect,  causing suffocation and death of the organisms. Studies performed using house crickets and lice suggest a close correlation between the death of the lice and the influx of the solution into the insect head tracheae."

PEG allows comfortable eye drop/natural tear instillation by offering improved spreading of the drop over the ocular surface with diminished blurring .PEG, depending on molecular weight, has various mechanisms of action , , , . Hydroxypropyl-guar (HPG) is used along with polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG) and propylene glycol (PG) as a gelling agent that conforms to abnormalities of the tear film and existing irregularities on the ocular surface . PEG provides lubrication and acts as a surfactant by coating the eye and interacting with propylene glycol and other solutions that help to act as surfactants on the eye mucosa . The delivery of drugs to mucosal surfaces is a significant challenge due to the presence of the protective mucus layer that acts to trap and quickly remove foreign particles."
1869,DB11079,"It is a topical analgesic used for temporary relief of minor pain associated with arthritis, simple backache, muscle strains, sprains, and bruises. Trolamine salicylate serves as an active ingredient in topical over-the-counter products for temporary management of mild to moderate muscular and joint pains.Trolamine salicylate is a salicylate that inhibits cyclo-oxygenase (COX) enzymes responsible for generating pro-inflammatory factors such as to induce pain and inflammation. It is thought to mediate its analgesic effect through inhibition of COX-2 enzyme, which is an induced enzyme responsible for inflammatory responses and pain in muscle and joint disorders. By inhibiting fatty acid COX enzyme, trolamine salicylate inhibits the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes in inflammatory cells involved in generating pain and inflammation . In subjects with osteoarthritis in hands, trolamine salicylate cream was shown to be effective in achieving temporary relief of minor pain and stiffness .Inflammation and tissue damage in different conditions including arthritis, bursitis, joint disorder, bruises, and strains or sprains of muscle origin, induce mild to moderate pain and are associated with increase prostaglandin synthesis ."

It is used in various chemical applications as a Lewis base, with anhydrous aluminium trichloride being the most commonly used Lewis acid. In antiperspirant products, FDA approves the use of aluminum chloride as an active ingredient up to 15%, calculated on the hexahydrate form, in an aqueous solution nonaerosol dosage form .Aluminum chloride is a hemostatic and antiperspirant agent.Aluminum chloride is commonly used topical antiperspirant. It is proposed that aluminum chloride works by causing an obstruction of the distal sweat gland ducts, where the metal ions precipitate with mucopolysaccharides, damaging epithelial cells along the lumen of the duct and forming a plug that blocks sweat output ."
1871,DB11085,"Contemporary therapeutic uses for resorcinol primarily revolve around the use of the phenol derivative as an active ingredient in topical antiseptics  or as topical antibacterial skin treatment products for conditions like acne, seborrheic dermatitis, eczema, and others .Resorcinol is a 1,3-isomer (or meta-isomer) of benzenediol with the formula C6H4(OH)2. Although it is primarily indicated for use as a topical application, resorcinol also possesses a well-documented anti-thyroidal activity that is generally not relied upon for any kind of formal therapeutic indication.In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that resorcinol can inhibit peroxidases in the thyroid and subsequently block the synthesis of thyroid hormones and cause goiter . Resorcinol interferes with the iodination of tyrosine and the oxidation of iodide . In LPO and TPO, the resulting Ï-cation radical of the porphyrin can isomerize to a radical cation with the radical in an aromatic side chain of the enzyme . Nevertheless, the effectiveness of the agent in treating various topical, dermatological conditions by eliciting antibacterial and keratolytic actions appears to stem from resorcinol's propensity for protein precipitation ."
1872,DB11089,"Indicated for the treatment of constipation associated with dry, hard stools or opioid induced constipation. Though recently, pressure has been building to end the use of docusate over concerns of efficacy.Docusate, or dioctyl sulfosuccinate, is a stool softener indicated for the treatment of constipation. Recent studies suggest that docusate's mechanism of action is due largely to it's surfactant effect in the intestines, which allow fat and water into the feces to soften the stool. Docusate was added directly to the jejunum based on calculated concentrations of docusate in the jejunum. At this concentration, there was an increase in secretion of water, sodium, chloride, and potassium as well as a decrease in absorption of glucose and bicarbonate."

Potassium nitrate is a common active ingredient in toothpaste, exerting an anti-sensitivity action. It is administered orally doses up to 30 g per animal per day .The potassium cation is an essential electrolyte that is important for the maintenance of intracellular osmotic pressure and for the maintenance of cell membrane potential, in particular, the potential of electrically excitable tissues . Potassium is the primary agent for common, over the counter de-sensitizing toothpaste that prevents the transmission of nerve endings to the teeth. Rather than directly poisoning rodents, nitrates support the combustion of charcoal in gas cartridges, promoting the production of toxic gases, which, are lethal to the target pest."
1874,DB11091,"Hydrogen peroxide is an unstable compound in the presence of a base or catalyst, and is typically stored with a stabilizer in a weakly acidic solution. If heated to its boiling point, it may undergo potentially explosive thermal decomposition. It is used in industrial and cosmetic applications as a bleaching agent. It acts as an oxidative biocide to generate free radical species to induce DNA, protein and membrane lipid damage via oxidation. The production of free hydroxyl radicals in the Fenton reaction is thought to be the basis of biocidal actions of hydrogen peroxide."
1875,DB11093,"For use as an over the counter calcium supplement.Calcium citrate is a salt typically used as a source of calcium in a variety of over the counter supplements.Increases plasma calcium levels leading to a decrease in calcium flux and increase in calcium deposition into bone Calcium citrate increases plasma calcium levels. This reduces calcium flux from osteocyte activity by reducing the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) . The reduction in calcium flux increases the amount of calcium deposited in bone resulting in an increase in bone mineral density. Since calcidiol increases the expression of calcium dependent ATPases and transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 6 (TRPV6) both of which are involved in calcium uptake from the gut, a reduction in calcidiol results in less calcium absorption. Additionally, TRPV5, the channel responsible for calcium reabsorption in the kidney, is downregulated when PTH secretion is reduced thus increasing calcium excretion via the kidneys."
1876,DB11094,"Vitamin D3 and D2 require hydroxylation in order to become biologically active in the human body. There are several different vitamin D supplements that are given to treat or to prevent osteomalacia and rickets, or to meet the daily criteria of vitamin D consumption.The in vivo synthesis of the predominant two biologically active metabolites of vitamin D occurs in two steps. It is parathyroid hormone that is responsible for the regulation of such metabolism at the level of the kidneys .Most individuals naturally generate adequate amounts of vitamin D through ordinary dietary intake of vitamin D (in some foods like eggs, fish, and cheese) and natural photochemical conversion of the vitamin D3 precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin via exposure to sunlight. At the liver, vitamin D3 or D2 is hydroxylated to 25-hydroxyvitamin D and then finally to the primary active metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in the kidney via further hydroxylation . This final metabolite binds to endogenous vitamin d receptors, which results in a variety of regulatory roles - including maintaining  calcium balance, the regulation of parathyroid hormone, the promotion of the renal reabsorption of calcium, increased intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus, and increased calcium and phosphorus mobilization of calcium and phosphorus from bone to plasma to maintain balanced levels of each in bone and the plasma ."
1877,DB11095,"Desirudin is a direct inhibitor of human thrombin. Hirudin is a single polypeptide chain of 65 amino acids residues and contains three disulfide bridges. It is mainly indicated for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis in hip replacement surgery patients. Common side effects include: Bleeding gums, collection of blood under the skin, coughing up blood, deep, dark purple bruise and difficulty with breathing or swallowing.Desirudin results in dose-dependent prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Inhibits fibrin formation, activation of coagulation factors V, VII, and XIII, and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation resulting in a dose-dependent prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)."
1878,DB11097,"It is found in some laxatives for treating occasional constipation and restoring regularity in bowel movements. Its potential benefit in maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis has been studied . Concurrently, the swollen mass of mucilage generates a lubricating layer that makes the transit of the intestinal contents easier .Psyllium seeds are comprised of dietary fibre which, when mixed with water forms a gel-like mass that works as a mild laxative . Moreover, as the presence of the gel-like mass increases the stool bulk it also increases the tension and/or the stretch stimulus in the bowel wall which serves to trigger bowel movements . The dietary fibre of which psyllium husk is comprised is fermented to various degrees by bacteria in the colon, resulting in production of carbon dioxide, hydrogen, methane, water, and short chain fatty acids, which are absorbed and brought into the hepatic circulation ."
1879,DB11098,"It can also be used as an excipient in drug formulations. An antacid is a medication used to neutralize gastric acid in a short timeframe after ingestion and the effect is soon overcome by meal-stimulated acid secretion.Potassium bicarbonate is a white, crystalline, slightly alkaline and salty substance. It is used in medicine as an antacid. This effect has been one of the problems of the use of potassium bicarbonate as it can cause eructation. The antacid potential of potassium bicarbonate is attained by increasing the gastrointestinal pH by neutralizing hydrochloric acid."
1880,DB11100,"Allantoin is commonly applied in a variety of topical vehicles or applications such as cosmetic creams, toothpastes, mouthwashes, shampoos, lipsticks, anti-acne products, and lotions  for the purpose of moisturizing skin, enhancing the smoothness of skin, stimulating the healing of wounds, and soothing irritated skin .Allantoin is a substance that is endogenous to the human body and also found as a normal component of human diets . During exercise, the plasma allantoin concentration rapidly increases about two fold and remains elevated . More specifically, allantoin is a diureide of glyoxylic acid that is produced from uric acid. It is a major metabolic intermediate in most organisms. Nevertheless, ongoing studies suggest that allantoin possesses moisturizing and keratolytic effects, as well as abilities to increase the water content of the extracellular matrix and enhance the desquamation of upper layers of dead skin cells, all of which are activities that can promote cell proliferation and facilitate wound healing .There is no well controlled data that can formally substantiate the method of action ."
1881,DB11102,"N-acetyltyrosine is indicated, in combination with several other amino acids and dextrose, as a peripherally administered source of nitrogen for nutritional support in patients with adequate stores of body fat in whom, for short periods, oral administration cannot be tolerated, is undesirable, or inadequate . When administered with other amino acids and concentrated dextrose, it is indicated for central vein infusion to prevent or reverse negative nitrogen balance in patients where the alimentary tract by the oral, gastrostomy, or jejestomy routes cannot or should not be used or in patients in which gastrointestinal absorption of protein is impaired, metabolic requirements for protein are substantially increased, or morbidity and mortality may be reduced by replacing amino acids lost from tissue breakdown N-acetyltyrosine, also referred to as N-acetyl-L-tyrosine, is used in place of as a tyrosine precursor. is a non-essential amino acid with a polar side group.

See  for more information on its role and pharmacology."
1882,DB11110,It is also used in over-the-counter products to relieve occasional constipation. Magnesium citrate can be one of the forms used for the administration of dietary supplements.Magnesium citrate is a low volume and osmotic cathartic agent. The cathartic action works primarily through the high osmolarity of the solution which draws large amounts of fluid into space where is used. It is also considered as an active ingredient in over-the-counter products.The onset of action can be as early as 30 minutes after administration with a mean onset time of approximately 2 hours and a maximum action of 4 hours. There is also a possible stimulation of fluid excretion by cholecystokinin release and activation of muscle peristalsis.
1883,DB11113,"Castor oil is a vegetable oil obtained by pressing the seeds of the castor oil plant (_Ricinus communis_ L.) mainly cultivated in India, South America, Africa, and China. Castor oil is a rich source of , which represents up to 90% of the total castor oil content. Due to its renewability and high versatility in addition to being the only commercial source of a hydroxylated fatty acid , castor oil has been used as a vital raw material for the chemical industry . In a prospective study, the group receiving oral castor oil was associated with a higher likelihood of initiation of labour compared to the placebo group . However, a recent study suggests that ricinoleic acid interacts with EP3 prostanoid receptors expressed on intestinal and uterine smooth muscles."
1884,DB11114,"As an active agent, eucalyptus oil has been indicated for relief of the symptoms of catarrhal colds, and/or the relief of the symptoms of minor muscular sprains and cramps .Eucalyptus oil is a distilled oil derived from the leaves of the tree Eucalyptus. It is shown to be effective in reducing pain, swelling, and inflammation via its modulatory effect on the immune response. Gastrointestinal absorption of eucalyptus appears to be rapid and may be enhanced by the intake of lipids and milk. 1,8-cineole (which makes up to as much as 90% of most commonly used cineole-based eucalyptus oils)  has also been found in vitro and in animals to possess cytochrome P450 inducing activity .The general consensus is that the exact mechanism of action of eucalyptus oil is largely unknown at this time but comprises various hypotheses from various studies. Some in vitro studies of human blood monocytes suggest a dose-dependent effect of eucalyptus oil to elicit significant inhibition of multiple cytokines, perhaps in the treatment of airway inflammation ."
1885,DB11121,"It is found in antibacterial soaps, wound-cleansing applications, and household antiseptics. Chloroxylenol is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.Chloroxylenol is a substituted phenol which has been widely used for many years as an ingredient of antiseptic and disinfectant products intended for external use . It is known to be bactericidal in low concentration to a wide range of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria .As a phenol antiseptic, it is believed that the hydroxyl -OH groups of the chloroxylenol molecule binds to certain proteins on the cell membrane of bacteria, and disrupts the membrane so as to allow the contents of the bacterial cell to leak out . This allows chloroxylenol to enter the bacterial cell to bind further with more proteins and enzymes to disable the cell's functioning . At particularly high concentrations of chloroxylenol, the protein and nucleic acid content of targeted bacterial cells become coagulated and cease to function, leading to rapid cell death ."
1886,DB11124,"It is a bronchodilator used in the temporary relief of mild symptoms of intermittent asthma including wheezing, tightness of chest and shortness of breath. It is an active ingredient in oral inhalation over-the-counter products as racepinephrine hydrochloride.Epinephrine acts on Î±- and Î²-adrenergic receptors. Epinephrine is a non-selective agonist at Î±- and Î²-adrenergic receptors, which are all G-protein-coupled receptors. Via its relaxer effects on the smooth muscle of the stomach, intestine, uterus and urinary bladder, epinephrine may also alleviate pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema and may relieve gastrointestinal and genitourinary symptoms associated with anaphylaxis. Epinephrine also acts on the Î±-adrenergic receptors on vascular smooth muscles, particularly in the skin and splanchnic vascular beds, to cause constriction."
1887,DB11126,"Calcium gluconate is the antidote for magnesium sulfate toxicity.Calcium gluconate is used as mineral supplement and medication when there is insufficient calcium in the diet. Calcium saccharate provides 6% of the total calcium and stabilizes the supersaturated solution of calcium gluconate. Each 10 mL of the injection provides 93 mg elemental calcium (Ca++) equivalent to 1 g of calcium gluconate.Calcium Gluconate is the gluconate salt of calcium. An element or mineral necessary for normal nerve, muscle, and cardiac function, calcium as the gluconate salt helps to maintain calcium balance and prevent bone loss when taken orally. Since the metabolic functions of calcium are essential for life, when there is a disturbance in the calcium balance because of dietary deficiency or other causes, the stores of calcium in bone may be depleted to fill the body's more acute needs."
1888,DB11127,"It also plays an important role in maintaining the general health of tissue and muscle and has antioxidant properties. It may also help in the prevention of cancer due to its stimulation of antioxidant activity and protection of cell membranes , . Prolonged TPN (total parenteral nutrition) support in humans has resulted in selenium deficiency symptoms which include muscle pain and tenderness. The symptoms have been reported to respond to supplementation of TPN solutions with selenium , . Its anticancer properties may be explained by the oxidation of free sulfhydryl groups."
1889,DB11130,"Opium and its alkaloid-derivatives can also be used as tranquilizers, antitussives and in the treatment of diarrhea. The direct use of opium is not common nowadays but the use of some of its derivatives such as morphine and codeine, as well as the use of a tincture of opium for severe diarrhea can be seen in medical practice. It has been known for a long time, and the first evidence of a poppy culture dates from 5 thousand years by the Sumerians. This plant is an integrant of the Papaveraceae family, and it is characterized by solitary leaves and capsulated fruits. Opium is a prohibited drug of abuse in most countries, but the illegal production of this drug and its derivatives keeps being registered."
1890,DB11133,"Omega-3 fatty acids play a critical role in metabolism and cellular function and they are available as daily supplements. They act to reduce plasma triglyceride levels however increase the cholesterol levels and are thought to possess potent antiarrythmic effects. DHA tends to exist in high concentrations in the retina, brain (via uptake by Mfsd2a as a transporter), and sperm.Omega-3 fatty acids mediate anti-inflammatory effects and increased levels of EPA or DHA has shown to decrease the levels of PGE2 and 4 series-LT.   Eicosapentaenoic acids compete with constitutive levels of arachidonic acid in cell membranes for the same desaturation enzymes and produce 3-series prostaglandins and thromboxanes, and 5-series leukotrienes which have low pro-inflammatory potential. EPA and DHA also give rise to resolvins and related lipid signalling molecules such as protectins via cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, which have anti-inflammatory effects. They also may reduce triglyceride synthesis because they are poor substrates for the enzymes responsible for TG synthesis, and EPA and DHA inhibit esterification of other fatty acids."
1891,DB11135,"For the supplementation of total parenteral nutrition to prevent hyposelenemia .Selenium is a trace metal in the human body particularly important as a component of glutathione peroxidase, an important enzyme in the prevention of cellular damage by free radicals and reactive oxygen species Selenium is incorporated into many different selenoproteins which serve various functions throughout the body .Selenium is first metabolized to selenophosphate and selenocysteine. This sequence is recognized by RNA ste loop structures called selenocysteine inserting sequences (SECIS). These structures require the binding of SECIS binding proteins (SBP-2) to recognize selenocystiene. Other unidentified proteins are required as part of the binding of this tRNA to the ribosome. Selenoproteins appear to be necessary for life as mice with the specialized tRNA gene knocked out exhibited early embryonic lethality ."
1892,DB11136,"Trivalent chromium (Cr(III)) ion is considered to be an essential dietary trace element as it is involved in metabolism of blood glucose, regulation of insulin resistance and metabolism of lipids. Chromium picolinate capsules may be used as nutritional adjuvant in patients with or at risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to improve blood sugar metabolism and stabilize the levels of serum cholesterol. Chromium upregulates insulin-stimulated insulin signal transduction via affecting effector molecules downstream of the insulin receptor (IR). Chromium enhances the kinase activity of insulin receptor Î² and increases the activity of downstream effectors, pI3-kinase and Akt. Under insulin-resistant conditions, chromium also promotes GLUT-4 transporter translocation that is independent of activity of IR, IRS-1, PI3-kinase, or Akt; chromium mediates cholesterol efflux from the membranes via increasing fluidity of the membrane by decreasing the membrane cholesterol and upregulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein ."
1893,DB11143,"The primary medical indications for cresols in general include being used as bactericides, pesticides, and disinfectants . Certain isomers of cresol, like m-cresol, may be used as inactive ingredients for the purpose of serving as a preservative in some pharmaceuticals .Cresol is a hydroxytoluene that can be extracted naturally from coal tar or made synthetically. Ingestion of cresol induces toxicity in humans and can lead to burning of the mouth and throat, abdominal pain, and/or vomiting. At concentrations normally found in the environment however, cresols do not pose any significant risk for the general population.All cresol isomers are absorbed across the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract and through the intact skin . There are know species differences in the specific conjugation reactions of cresol isomers and the relative amounts of glucuronide and sulfate conjugates therefore differ between species and also vary with dose .When cresol isomers are used directly as the active ingredient in bactericides or disinfectants, it appears as if much of the evidence for the mechanism of action for such phenolic germicides indicates that their effect is due to physical damage of bacterial cell membranes ."
1894,DB11145,"Oxyquinoline is used as a biocidal component of several over the counter products. These products are marketed for the purposes of inhibiting abnormal biological growth in the vagina and restoring natural pH. Oxyquinoline is a heterocyclic phenol and derivative of quinoline with antiseptic, disinfectant, and pesticide properties. It is used as a stabilizer for hydrogen peroxide, where it is sometimes added in cosmetic products.Oxyquinoline acts as a biocide to eliminate bacteria and fungi .The mechanism by which oxyquinoline exerts its biocidal effect is unknown."
1895,DB11148,"It is also indicated as a surface anesthetic for skin a mucous membrane and for the relief of pain and pruritus associated with anorectal disorders.Butamben is a local anesthetic in the form of n-butyl-p-aminobenzoate. Its structure corresponds to the standard molecule of a hydrophilic and hydrophobic domain separated by an intermediate ester found in most of the local anesthetics. Due to its very low water solubility, butamben is considered to be suitable only for topical anesthesia. The FDA removed all parenteral butamben products from the market, possibly due to the poor solubility of this drug.Butamben has been shown to selectively inhibit dorsal root pain signal transmission for periods of months when administered as epidural suspensions. All the effects of butamben are performed in the root ganglion neurons which suggests that the related anesthetic effect may be caused by the reduced electrical excitability."
1896,DB11153,"In addition to the above, potassium hydroxide is used as a softener for nail grooves .Potassium hydroxide, also known as _lye_  is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula _KOH_. Potassium hydroxide is also a precursor to other potassium compounds. Potassium hydroxide is used in food to adjust pH, as a stabilizer, and as a thickening agent. It was determined that topical KOH solution was found to be a safe and effective treatment of plane warts .The corrosiveness of potassium hydroxide renders it a very useful agent in the decomposition/removal soft tissue and hair removal. The mechanism of skin injury by alkali substances such as potassium hydroxide is by the saponification of fat, causing fatty tissue to lose its function with increased damage due to a heat reaction."
1897,DB11156,"Pyrantel pamoate (embonate) ingested orally is effective for removal and control of ascarid and hookworm infections in puppies and dogs (adult Toxocara canis, Toxascaris leonina, Ancylostoma tubaeforme, An. braziliense, Uncinaria stenocephala), cats (adult Toxocara cati, Toxa. leonina, An. In humans, it is administered as pyrantel pamoate ,,,.It has similar properties to both competitive and depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents, which leads to the understanding of the paralytic effect of the drug has on parasites, ultimately resulting in the death of the parasite , . This action is unlike piperazine, which is a hyperpolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent that causes relaxation of the helminth muscles, leading to a subsequent detachment from the intestinal wall."
1898,DB11164,Bicisate as a complex with technetium Tc-99m is used in single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) as an adjunct to conventional CT or MRI in the localization of stroke in patients whom the presence of a stroke has already been diagnosed. This property is given by its N2S2 core. The hydrolysis of bicisate forms the monoacid and diacid bicisate derivatives. The formation of these derivatives results in high brain uptake and retention. The uptake of bicisate depends on the blood flow directed to the brain and thus the presence of a stroke will be translated into specific zones in the brain that would not include the complex of bicisate and technetium Tc-99m.
1899,DB11166,"Antithrombin alfa is a recombinant antithrombin it is indicated for the prevention of peri-operative and peri-partum thromboembolic events in patients with hereditary deficiency of antithrombin. Antithrombin Alfa is a recombinant antithrombin , an anticoagulant, that is used for the  prevention of thromboembolic events in patients that have hereditary deficiency  of antithrombin in high risk situations.Hereditary antithrombin deficiency causes an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). In high risk situations, such as surgery or trauma or for pregnant women during the peri-partum period, the risk of development of VTEs is 10-50 times greater than the general population. In hereditary antithrombin deficient patients antithrombin alfa normalizes plasma antthrombin activity levels during peri-operative and peri-partum periods.Antithrombin is the main inhibitor of thrombin and Factor Xa , the serine proteases involved in blood coagulation. Antithrombin neutralizes the activity of thrombin and Factor Xa by forming a complex which is rapidly removed from the circulation."
1900,DB11171,"This solution is an antihemorrhagic agent used in skin and mucosal biopsies. It is used in different fields such as dermatology, dentistry and it is thought to present hemostatic properties by interacting chemically with blood proteins. Some studies have reported the generation of inflammation in the sites of administration of ferric sulfate.The main function of ferric sulfate is as a hemostatic agent in different medical practices. This hemostatic function is achieved when ferric sulfate is applied directly in the damaged tissue. The formation of the ferric protein complex is thought to be due to a chemical reaction between the acidic form of ferric sulfate and the blood proteins."

Ethylmercury is metabolized to inorganic mercury more rapidly than methylmercury."
1937,DB11591,"For symptomatic relief of nasal and non-nasal symptoms of seasonal rhinitis in patients 12 years of age and older and for symptomatic relief in chronic spontaneous urticaria in patients 18 years of age and older .Bilastine is a novel new-generation antihistamine that is highly selective for the H1 histamine receptor, has a rapid onset and prolonged duration of action.Bilastine is an antiallergenic and acts to reduce allergic symptoms such as nasal congestion and urticaria .Bilastine is a selective histamine H1 receptor antagonist (Ki = 64nM) . During allergic response mast cells undergo degranulation which releases histamine and other subastances. By binding to and preventing activation of the H1 receptor, bilastine reduces the development of allergic symptoms due to the release of histamine from mast cells."
1938,DB11595,"Atezolizumab has approved indications for the following conditions:  Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) - as adjuvant treatment following resection and platinum-based chemotherapy for adult patients with Stage II to IIIA NSCLC whose tumours have PD-L1 expression on â¥ 1% of tumour cells, as determined by an FDA-approved test. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumour aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for NSCLC harbouring these aberrations prior to receiving atezolizumab. Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) - for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic HCC who have not received prior systemic therapy. Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma (ASPS) - for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 2 years of age and older with unresectable or metastatic ASPS.Atezolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody used to prevent the interaction of PD-L1 and PD-1, removing inhibition of immune responses seen in some cancers.

1939,DB11596,"Levoleucovorin is indicated for use as rescue therapy following high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Levoleucovorin, as the product Fusilev (FDA, dosed at one-half the usual dose of racemic d,l-leucovorin), has an additional indication for use in combination chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced metastatic colorectal cancer (although they should not be mixed in the same infusion as a precipitate may form).Levoleucovorin is the enantiomerically active form of Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin). In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. As folate analogs, levoleucovorin and leucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects."

IMOGAM Rabies Pasteurized should be administered promptly after exposure, in conjunction with rabies vaccine. If IMOGAM Rabies Pasteurized is not administered as recommended at the initiation of the post-exposure rabies vaccine series, it can be administered up to eight days following the first dose of the rabies vaccine. This affords time for the rabies vaccine, which is also administered in cases of rabies exposure, to induce an immune response to destroy the virus. Rabies immunoglobulin should only be administered up to eight days after exposure as the host begins to produce sufficient antibodies to the virus one week after exposure."

During allergic response mast cells undergo degranulation, releasing histamine and other substances . Histamine acts on H1 receptors to produce symptoms of nasal blockage, rhinorhea, itching, and swelling. PAF is produced from phospholipids cleaved by phospholipase A2. It acts to produce vascular leakage which contributes to rhinorhea and nasal blockage."
1949,DB11619,"Gestrinone was developed in the early 1970s and was tested clinically as a weekly oral contraceptive in Europe and North America. Gestrinone has moderate anti-estrogen, and anti-gonadal properties, which can lead to increased concentrations of free testosterone, and decrease the level of sex hormone-binding globulin, suppress the FSH and LH hormone peak levels and decrease the LH mean to reduce estrogen levels. In addition, gestrinone has a direct effect on the endometrium and ectopic endometrial receptors, which have the roles of anti-progesterone and anti-estrogen effects lead to endometrial and ectopic endometrial atrophy to achieve therapeutic effects . Aside from its central action, gestrinone also has anti-progesterone activity on cell receptors in both endometrium and extra-uterine ectopic implants. The data from the study suggest that the mechanism of action of gestrinone used for the purposes of emergency contraception is likely the inhibition of implantation by acting on the endometrium as opposed to the inhibition of ovulation ."

In a clinical study involving patients with pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis or extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, treatment of delamanid in combination with WHO-recommended optimised background treatment regimen was associated with improved treatment outcomes and reduced mortality rate . Spontaneous resistance to delamanid was observed during treatment, where mutation in one of the 5 F420 coenzymes responsible for bioactivation of delamanid contributes to this effect . Delamanid has no in vitro activity against Gram negative or positive bacterial species and does not display cross-resistance to other anti-tuberculosis drugs . Upon activation, the radical intermediate formed between delamanid and desnitro-imidazooxazole derivative  is thought to mediate antimycobacterial actions via inhibition of methoxy-mycolic and keto-mycolic acid synthesis, leading to depletion of mycobacterial cell wall components and destruction of the mycobacteria ."

Fruquintinib is a novel small-molecule anti-VEGFR that targets VEGFR-1,-2, and -3 to inhibit angiogenesis. For the small-molecule approach, most earlier generations of VEGFR inhibitors such as , , , and  have poor selectivity, thus increasing the risk of off-target toxicity. Therefore, the advent of fruquintinib, a new generation of VEGFR inhibitors with a high kinome selectivity, demonstrated the feasibility of the small-molecule inhibitor approach. Inhibition of VEGF-induced VEGFR-2 phosphorylation was illustrated in both in vitro and in vivo studies."

Patients with CKD cannot induce erythropoietin (EPO) production in response to hypoxia or anemia. As a potent inhibitor of PHD1, PHD2 and PHD3 (â¥â1000-fold selectivity), daprodustat stabilizes cellular HIF1Î± and HIF2Î± and the induces erythropoiesis. On October 2022, the FDA Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee (CRDAC) supported that the benefit of treatment with daprodustat outweighs the risks for adult dialysis patients with anemia of CKD but not for non-dialysis patients with anemia of CKD. On February 1, 2023, daprodustat was fully approved by the FDA as the first oral treatment for anemia caused by chronic kidney disease in patients on dialysis."
1970,DB11689,"Selumetinib is indicated for the treatment of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) in patients two years and older who have symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas (PN).Activation of the Raf-MEK-ERK signalling pathway is known to be implemented in several types of malignancies; thus, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors such as selumetinib are important tools that can target the problematic overactivity of this pathway. However, selumetinib demonstrated impressive efficacy and tolerability in Phase I trials, leading to its continued investigation for the treatment of various types of tumours in Phase II trials. Some patients with this disorder develop plexiform neurofibromas (PN); however, this is considered relatively uncommon compared to other variants of NF-1. By selectively targeting MEK1 and MEK2, selumetinib is able to inhibit oncogenic downstream effects of the Raf-MEK-ERK signaling pathway, which is often overactive in certain types of cancer. ERK is then able to exert its effects on several downstream targets."
1971,DB11691,"It is a modified form of  to which a side chain has been added to increase molecular weight and polar surface area resulting in restricted transport across the blood brain barrier. Naldemedine was approved in 2017 in both the US and Japan for the treatment of Opioid-induced Constipation.Naldemedine is an opioid receptor antagonist with restricted movement across the blood brain barrier . This allows it to antagonize the periperal effects of opioid drugs such as constipation without interfering with the effects on the central nervous system.Naldemedine binds to and antagonizes mu-, delta-, and kappa-opioid receptors . The binding of opioid agonists to peripheral mu-opioid receptors slows the transit of feces through the intestine resulting in constipation. By antagonizing mu-opioid receptors, naldemedine inhibits this effect."
1972,DB11693,"Voclosporin is used in combination with a background immunosuppressive regimen for the treatment of lupus nephritis.Lupus nephritis (LN) is a type of glomerulonephritis occurring in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Early intervention with voclosporin coupled with a kidney response is believed to prevent irreversible damage to the kidney and lead to better long-term clinical outcomes for patients with LN. In July 2022, the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended voclosporin be granted marketing authorization for use in combination with  for the treatment of adult patients with active lupus nephritis.Voclosporin inhibits calcineurin, leading to the inhibition of T cell activation by blocking the transcription of early inflammatory cytokines. Cyclosporine inhibitors reversibly inhibit T-lymphocytes. Along with calcineurin inhibition, the inhibition of many transcription factors necessary for the induction of various cytokine genes such as IL-2, IFN-Î³, IL-4 and GM-CSF occurs."
1973,DB11697,"Pacritinib is indicated for the treatment of adults with intermediate or high-risk primary or secondary (post-polycythemia vera or post-essential thrombocythemia) myelofibrosis with a platelet count below 50 x 109/L. It provides a treatment option for patients who have MF with severe thrombocytopenia, which occurs in approximately one-third of MF patients and carries with it a particularly poor prognosis.Pacritinib is administered orally twice daily, with or without food. A baseline QTc interval should be obtained prior to initiating therapy and regular monitoring (including for risk factors, e.g. hypokalemia) should continue throughout therapy.While the pathogenesis of myelofibrosis (MF) is still poorly understood, both primary and secondary (i.e. post-polycythemia vera or post-essential thrombocythemia) myelofibrosis have been associated with mutations of JAK2. Signaling pathways initiated by JAK2 generate a number of cytokines and growth factors responsible for hematopoiesis and immune functioning, and its dysregulation is thought to be a driver of MF pathogenesis. Pacritinib is thought to exert its pharmacologic activity via inhibition of wild-type JAK2, mutant JAK2V617F, and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)."
1974,DB11699,"For the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic therapy and postoperative. Tropisetron is an indole derivative with antiemetic activity. As a selective serotonin receptor antagonist, tropisetron competitively blocks the action of serotonin at 5HT3 receptors, resulting in suppression of chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Tropisetron appears to be well tolerated with the most frequently reported adverse effect being headache. Extrapyramidal side effects are rare upon using tropisetron.Tropisetron competitively binds to and blocks the action of serotonin at 5HT3 receptors peripherally on vagus nerve terminals located in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract as well as centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) of the area postrema of the central nervous system (CNS)."
1975,DB11703,"Acalabrutinib is currently indicated for the treatment of adult patients with Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least one prior therapy. This Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor indicated for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, small lymphocytic lymphoma, and in adult patients with Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have already received at least one prior therapy. Also known as ACP-196, acalabrutinib is also considered a second generation BTK inhibitor because it was rationally designed to be more potent and selective than ibrutinib, theoretically expected to demonstrate fewer adverse effects owing to minimized bystander effects on targets other than BTK. At this time, more than 35 clinical trials across 40 countries with more than 2500 patients are underway or have been completed with regards to further research into better understanding and expanding the therapeutic uses of acalabrutinib .Acalabrutinib is a Bruton Tyrosine Kinase inhibitor that prevents the proliferation, trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion of B cells. As a result, acalabrutinib inhibits BTK-mediated activation of downstream signaling proteins CD86 and CD69, which ultimately inhibits malignant B-cell proliferation and survival    Whereas ibrutinib is typically recognized as the first-in-class BTK inhibitor, acalabrutinib is considered a second generation BTK inhibitor primarily because it demonstrates highter selectivity and inhibition of the targeted activity of BTK while having a much greater IC50 or otherwise virtually no inhibition on the kinase activities of ITK, EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB4, JAK3, BLK, FGR, FYN, HCK, LCK, LYN, SRC, and YES1."
1976,DB11712,"Tezacaftor, when used in combination with ivacaftor and  in the product Trikafta, is also indicated for the treatment of CF in patients 12 years of age and older that have at least one _F508del_ mutation in the CFTR gene. Cystic Fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by one of several different mutations in the gene for the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) protein, an ion channel involved in the transport of chloride and sodium ions across cell membranes. CFTR is active in epithelial cells of organs such as of the lungs, pancreas, liver, digestive system, and reproductive tract. As a result, CF patients produce thick, sticky mucus that clogs the ducts of organs where it is produced making patients more susceptible to complications such as infections, lung damage, pancreatic insufficiency, and malnutrition.Clinical studies have shown a significant decrease in sweat chloride and an increase in the forced expiratory volume (FEV), a measure of lung function, following Tevacaftor/Ivacaftor therapy. This is done by modulating the position of the CFTR protein on the cell surface to the correct position, allowing for adequate ion channel formation and increased in water and salt movement through the cell membrane."
1977,DB11714,"In September 2018, durvalumab was approved by the EMA for the treatment of adult patients with  locally advanced, unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), only if PD-L1 is expressed in â¥ 1% of tumour cells and there was no observable disease progression following platinum-based chemoradiation therapy. On March 27, 2020, durvalumab was approved by the FDA for as first-line treatment of patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC).Durvalumab is an anticancer antibody that works to promote the antitumour responses mediated by immune cells. Both PD-L1 and PD-1 are co-inhibitory molecules involved in blocking T cell-mediated immune responses. By binding to PD-L1 and preventing its association with PD-1 and CD80, durvalumab activates the immune responses mediated by cytotoxic T cells that attack tumour cells. Durvalumab displays selective and high affinity toward PD-L1 but not PD-L2, which is a regulatory ligand expressed in tumour cells to a lesser extent and involved in regulating inflammation and differentiation of T cells."
1978,DB11718,"Encorafenib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a BRAF V600E mutation.Encorafenib, also known as _BRAFTOVI_,  is a kinase inhibitor. On June 27, 2018, the Food and Drug Administration approved encorafenib and  (BRAFTOVI and MEKTOVI, Array BioPharma Inc.) in combination for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test.Encorafenib has a pharmacologic profile that is distinct from that of other clinically active BRAF inhibitors and has shown improved efficacy in the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Encorafenib inhibited in vitro growth of tumor cell lines expressing BRAF V600 E, D, and K mutations. Compared with either drug alone, the co-administration of encorafenib and binimetinib resulted in greater anti-proliferative activity in vitro in BRAF mutation-positive cell lines and greater anti-tumor activity with respect to tumor growth inhibition in BRAF V600E mutant human melanoma xenograft studies in mice. Increased tumor growth delay after dosing cessation was also observed with the co-administration compared to either drug alone."
1979,DB11730,"Kisqali (ribociclib) is a selective cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, a class of drugs that help slow the progression of cancer by inhibiting two proteins called cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6). These proteins, when over-activated, can enable cancer cells to grow and divide too quickly. Targeting CDK4/6 with enhanced precision may play a role in ensuring that cancer cells do not continue to replicate uncontrollably.Ribociclib is a selective cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, a class of drugs that help slow the progression of cancer by inhibiting two proteins called cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6). These proteins, when over-activated, can enable cancer cells to grow and divide too quickly. For example, CDK4 is not required for normal mammary tissue development based on knockout mouse studies, but it is needed for growth of Ras-induced mammary tumors, suggesting a potential therapeutic window for treatment with lower toxicity."
1980,DB11732,"Lasmiditan is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults.Lasmiditan is an oral medication used in the termination of migraine headaches that was first approved for use in the United States in October 2019. Triptans abort migraines via action at several serotonin receptors, including 5-HT1D and 5-HT1B receptors, and activity at the 5-HT1B receptor has been specifically implicated in their vasoconstrictive activity. Lasmiditan, in contrast, is a highly selective agonist of 5-HT1F receptors, carrying virtually no affinity for other receptors which appear to be largely responsible for the adverse effect profile of its predecessors - in other words, lasmiditanâs selectivity allows for the successful termination of migraines without causing vasoconstriction. Selectivity for 5-HT1F, a lack of vasoconstrictive activity, and the ability to terminate migraines through neuronal inhibition has resulted in the creation of a new class of anti-migraine medications in which lasmiditan is the first and only member: the neurally-acting anti-migraine medications (NAAMAs).Lasmiditan belongs to a new and novel class of acute anti-migraine medications that exert their effects via inhibition of neuronal firing rather than vasoconstriction of cerebral arteries. The neurogenic hypothesis of migraine pathophysiology, an alternative to the vascular hypothesis, suggests that cerebral vasodilation is a secondary mechanism in migraine pathogenesis, and that the main contributor to migraine headache pain is the increased pathogenic firing of trigeminal nerve pathways."
1981,DB11739,"Another co-packaged product with only vonoprazan and amoxicillin is also indicated for the treatment of H. pylori infection in adults.Vonoprazan is a potassium-competitive acid blocker (PCAB) that inhibits H+, K+-ATPase-mediated gastric acid secretion. Furthermore, vonoprazan is 350-times more potent than the proton-pump inhibitor , thanks to its ability to accumulate in the gastric corpus mucosa, specifically in the parietal cells. In February 2015, vonoprazan was first marketed in Japan for the treatment of acid-related disorders and as an adjunct to Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication.The use of vonoprazan leads to an increase in intragastric pH. The inhibitory effect of vonoprazan on acid secretion increases with repeated daily dosing. Compared to other PCABs, such as SCH28080, or proton-pump inhibitors, such as lansoprazole, vonoprazan has a more potent H+, K+-ATPase inhibitory activity.Vonoprazan is a potassium-competitive acid blocker (PCAB) that inhibits the H+, K+-ATPase enzyme system in a potassium-competitive manner."
1982,DB11751,"Intramuscular extended-release cabotegravir in combination with rilpivirine is indicated as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older weighing at least 35 kg to replace the current antiretroviral regimen in those who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen with no history of treatment failure and with no known or suspected resistance to either cabotegravir or rilpivirine. An extended-release injectable suspension formulation of cabotegravir is also indicated for the prevention of sexually-acquired HIV-1 infection (i.e. for pre-exposure prophylaxis, PrEP) in at-risk adults and adolescents weighing at least 35kg.Cabotegravir, or GSK1265744, is an HIV-1 integrase inhibitor that is prescribed with the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, . Early research into cabotegravir showed it had lower oral bioavailability than , which resulted in the development of long acting monthly intramuscular injection formulation for cabotegravir. It has a long duration of action as the oral tablet is given daily and the intramuscular suspension is given monthly. Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of hypersensitivity, hepatotoxicity, and depression.Cabotegravir binds to the active site of HIV integrase, preventing strand transfer of the viral genome into the host genome, and preventing replication of the virus."
1983,DB11753,"To prevent drug-resistant bacteria, it is important to mention that the use of rifamycin for this indication should be only done in cases where the infection is proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria. The most common cause of travellers' diarrhea is a pathogen and from the pathogens identified, bacteria is the most common cause followed by norovirus, rotavirus and similar viruses.Rifamycin is the prime member of the rifamycin family which are represented by drugs that are a product of fermentation from the gram-positive bacterium Amycolatopsis mediterranei, also known as Streptomyces mediterranei. This drug was also sent for review to the EMA in 2015 by Dr. Falk Pharma Gmbh and it was granted a waiver for the tested conditions.Rifamycin is known to be effective against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens and mycobacteria. In this trial, rifamycin was proven to significantly reduce the symptoms of travellers' diarrhea.Rifamycins, as well as all the other members of this group, present an antibacterial mechanism of action related to the inhibition of RNA synthesis. This mechanism of action is done by the strong binding to the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase of prokaryotes."
1984,DB11757,"Istradefylline, or KW6002, was developed by Kyowa Hakko Kirin in Japan for the treatment of Parkinson's disease as an adjunct to standard therapy. This region of the brain is highly involved in motor control. Istradefylline was granted FDA approval on 27 August 2019.Istradefylline is a selective adenosine A2A receptor inhibitor. These receptors are found in the basal ganglia, a region of the brain that suffers degeneration in Parkinson's disease, and is also significantly involved in motor control. The GABAergic action of this pathway is thereby reduced."
1985,DB11760,"Talazoparib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA-mutated (gBRCAm) HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. This indication is approved by the FDA, EMA, and Health Canada. In the US, talazoparib is also indicated in combination with  for the treatment of adult patients with HRR gene-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).Talazoparib is an inhibitor of mammalian polyadenosine 5â-diphosphoribose polymerases (PARPs), enzymes responsible for regulating essential cellular functions, such as DNA transcription and DNA repair. Inhibition of the BER pathway by talazoparib leads to the accumulation of unrepaired SSBs, which leads to the formation of DSBs, which is the most toxic form of DNA damage. Inhibition of PARP in cancer cells with BRCA mutations leads to genomic instability and apoptotic cell death."
1986,DB11761,"Tenapanor is indicated for the treatment of constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) in adults. It is also indicated to reduce serum phosphorus in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis as add-on therapy in patients who have an inadequate response to phosphate binders or who are intolerant of any dose of phosphate binder therapy.Tenapanor is a novel, small molecule medication approved in September 2019 for the treatment of constipation-predominant irritable bowel-syndrome (IBS-C). As an inhibitor of the sodium/hydrogen exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3) transporter, it is the first and currently only medication within its class and therefore exists as a novel alternative in the treatment of IBS-C. In October 2023, tenapanor was approved for the treatment of chronic kidney disease.Through the inhibition of dietary sodium absorption tenapanor causes an increase in water secretion into the intestines, thereby decreasing transit time and softening stool consistency.Tenapanor is a locally-acting small molecule inhibitor of the sodium/hydrogen exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3), an antiporter expressed on the apical surface of enterocytes in the small intestine and colon which is involved in sodium-fluid homeostasis. There is some evidence that tenapanor can inhibit the uptake of dietary phosphorus in the gastrointestinal tract, though the exact mechanism of this activity has yet to be elucidated."
1987,DB11763,"Momelotinib is indicated for the treatment of intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis (MF), including primary MF or secondary MF , in adults with anemia.Momelotinib is a Janus Kinase 1 (JAK1) and 2 (JAK2) inhibitor. First approved by the FDA on September 15, 2023, momelotinib is used to treat myelofibrosis. Clinical manifestations of MF include anemia and thrombocytosis. Momelotinib works to block the JAK-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signalling pathway, which is aberrant in MF.Momelotinib inhibits Janus Kinase 1 and 2 (JAK1/JAK2) with an IC50 of 11 and 18 nM, respectively. Iron availability and erythropoiesis were assessed by analysis of circulating hepcidin concentrations: an acute and sustained reduction of circulating hepcidin was observed for the duration of the 24-week administration of momelotinib to patients with MF.One of the molecular pathways that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of MF is constitutively activated and dysregulated Janus protein tyrosine kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signalling, which is believed to drive the abnormal production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in bone marrow stroma."
1988,DB11767,"RA is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by polyarthritis, and its treatment has been challenged by the different responses in every patient. Peak reduction in the absolute neutrophile count was observed after 3 to 4 days of treatment, followed by a recovery to baseline levels. A decrease in fibrinogen and serum amyloid A and an increase in hemoglobin and serum albumin were also detected.Sarilumab is a human recombinant IgG1 antibody that binds to both forms of interleukin 6 receptors (IL-6R), thus inhibiting IL-6-mediated signaling. IL-6 is also found in synovial fluid and plays a major role in the pathological inflammation and joint destruction features of RA. Thus, it is used for the treatment of RA due to its ability to inhibit intra-articular and systemic IL-6 signaling."
1989,DB11771,"It is also indicated for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with no sensitizing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) genomic tumor Aberrations.Tremelimumab, formerly known as ticilimumab, is a fully human IgG2 monoclonal antibody directed against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4). CTLA-4 is a cell surface receptor expressed on activated T cells to act as a negative regulator for T cells. CD28 and CTLA-4 are homologous receptors expressed on CD4+ and CD8+ T cell surface. B7 molecules act as ligands to both of these receptors, and the balance between CD28 and CTLA-4 expression and signalling influence the extent of T cell activation. By binding to CTLA-4, tremelimumab blocks the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands, CD80 and CD86, limiting its negative regulatory effect on T cell activation."
1990,DB11776,"Brodalumab has been approved for the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris, psoriatic arthritis, pustular psoriasis and psoriatic erythroderma. Brodalumab has been used in trials studying the treatment of Asthma, Psoriasis, Crohn's Disease, Psoriatic Arthritis, and Rheumatoid Arthritis. Brodalumab was FDA approved in February, 2017 as Siliq for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.Increase in the level of IL-17 due to blocking of its receptors. Brodalumab binds with high affinity to interleukin (IL)-17 receptor A, thereby inhibiting several pro-inflammatory cytokines from the IL-17 family."

Mutations in MET have been detected in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and the prevalence of MET amplification in epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI)-naive patients with NSCLC has been reported to be 1.4% - 21%. This co-occurrence has made c-Met a desirable target in the treatment of NSCLC. Manufactured by Novartis and marketed under the brand name Tabrecta, capmatinib was granted accelerated approval by the FDA on May 6, 2020, for the treatment of NSCLC in patients whose tumors have a mutation that leads to mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) exon 14 skipping. Mutations in MET are involved in the proliferation of many cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)."
1992,DB11793,"Niraparib is indicated for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced or recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in complete or partial response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. By blocking the enzymes responsible for DNA repair, niraparib induces cytotoxicity in cancer cells. Niraparib was approved by the European Commission on November 16, 2017  and by Health Canada on June 27, 2019.Niraparib mediated cytotoxic effects in tumour cell lines with or without deficiencies in BRCA1/2. In vitro studies suggest that niraparib inhibits dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin transporters, which may explain its off-target cardiovascular effects such as increased pulse rate and blood pressure.Niraparib is a potent and selective inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes, PARP-1 and PARP-2. Different DNA repair pathways exist to repair these DNA damages, including the base excision repair (BER) pathway for SSBs and BRCA-dependent homologous recombination for DSBs."
1993,DB11796,"Fostemsavir is indicated for the treatment of multidrug-resistant HIV-1 infection in heavily treatment-experienced adults failing their current antiretroviral therapy due to resistance, intolerance, or safety concerns.Fostemsavir is the phosphonooxymethyl prodrug of temsavir, a novel HIV-1 attachment inhibitor. It binds to and inhibits the activity of gp120, a subunit within the HIV-1 gp160 envelope glycoprotein that facilitates the attachment of HIV-1 to host cell CD4 receptors - in doing so, temsavir prevents the first step in the HIV-1 viral lifecycle. It has a moderate duration of action necessitating twice-daily dosing. Fostemsavir should also be used with caution in patients with hepatitis B or C co-infection as elevations in hepatic transaminases were observed in greater proportions in these populations in clinical trials.The gp120 subunit within the gp160 envelope glycoprotein of HIV-1 is a new and novel target in the treatment of HIV-1 infection. It has also been shown to inhibit other gp120-dependent post-attachment steps required for viral entry."
1994,DB11799,"Additionally, Bictegravir is indicated in the management of HIV-1 infection in patients who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL) on a regular antiretroviral regimen for a minimum of three months without a history of failure in treatment and no known factors associated with the resistance to the individual components of the medication.Bictegravir is a recently approved investigational drug that has been used in trials studying the treatment of HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection.Bictegravir is an HIV-1 integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI). Bictegravir (BIC) inhibits strand transfer of viral DNA into the host genome and thereby prevents HIV-1 replication . Plasma exposure to TAF leads to leakage into cells and then TAF is intracellularly converted to tenofovir by hydrolysis by cathepsin. Tenofovir is subsequently phosphorylated by cellular kinases to the metabolite tenofovir diphosphate, which is the active form of the drug. Tenofovir diphosphate inhibits HIV-1 replication by incorporating into viral DNA by the HIV reverse transcriptase, resulting in DNA chain-termination."

Marketed by Aveo Oncology, tivozanib is a promising therapy for individuals with RCC who have not been treated successfully with other therapies.Tivozanib inhibits growth factor receptors, treating renal cell carcinoma. Tivozanib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that exerts its actions by inhibiting the phosphorylation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-1, VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 and inhibits other kinases such as c-kit and platelet derived growth factor beta (PDGFR Î²). The above actions inhibit tumour growth and progression, treating renal cell carcinoma."
1996,DB11817,"In the US and Europe, baricitinib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more TNF blockers. Recently, it is also approved as the treatment for severe alopecia areata in adults.Baricitinib is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. The EC later approved baricitinib for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, making it the first JAK inhibitor used for this indication in Europe. Baricitinib decreased the levels of immunoglobulins and serum C-reactive protein in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.As members of the tyrosine kinase family, Janus kinases (JAKs) are intracellular enzymes that modulate signals from cytokines and growth factor receptors involved in hematopoiesis, inflammation, and immune cell function.

1997,DB11823,"On March 5, 2019, the nasal spray drug, esketamine, also known as Spravato (by Janssen Pharmaceuticals), was approved by the FDA for treatment-resistant major depression. This is the first time that the FDA has approved esketamine for any use. Peak blood pressure elevation after esketamine administration occurs about 40 minutes after administration and lasts approximately 4 hours. Cognitive effects In a study of healthy volunteers, one dose of this agent caused decline in cognitive performance 40 minutes after administration. The long-term cognitive effects of esketamine have not been studied for more than a 1 year period, therefore, the risk of cognitive decline with long-term use is not yet confirmed.Esketamine, the S-enantiomer of racemic ketamine, is a non-selective, non-competitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, an ionotropic glutamate receptor."
1998,DB11827,"Ertugliflozin is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Ertugliflozin is not recommended for use to improve glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.Ertugliflozin is a sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor used to treat type II diabetes mellitus. It was also approved by the European Commission in March 2018.Ertugliflozin causes a dose-dependent increase in urinary glucose excretion and an increase in urinary volume in patients with T2DM.Kidneys play an integral role in glucose homeostasis. In the case of hyperglycemia, SGLTs become saturated and the renal threshold for urinary glucose excretion is increased. Ertugliflozin is an inhibitor of SGLT2 that reduces renal reabsorption of filtered glucose and lowers the renal threshold for glucose, thereby increasing urinary glucose excretion."
1999,DB11828,"For use as an extended adjuvant treatment in adult patients with early stage HER2-overexpressed/amplified breast cancer, to follow adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy .Neratinib was approved in July 2017 for use as an extended adjuvant therapy in Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) positive breast cancer.

2001,DB11837,"Osilodrostat is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with Cushing's disease for whom pituitary surgery is not an option or has not been curative.Osilodrostat is an inhibitor of 11Î²-hydroxylase (also referred to as CYP11B1), the enzyme that catalyzes the final step in the biosynthesis of endogenous cortisol. Osilodrostat was approved for use in the EU in January 2020 for the treatment of endogenous Cushing's syndrome (i.e. Cushing's disease), and was granted FDA approval and Orphan Drug designation in the US in March 2020 for the same indication.Osilodrostat lowers endogenous cortisol levels by inhibiting the enzyme that catalyzes the final step in cortisol synthesis. Patients should be monitored for these symptoms as they are evidence of elevated 11-deoxycorticosterone levels, and for symptoms such as hirustism, acne, and hypertrichosis which may be suggestive of excessive circulating androgen levels.Cushingâs syndrome is an endocrine disorder resulting from chronic and excessive exposure to glucocorticoids, the symptoms of which may include thinning of the skin and hair, weight gain, muscle weakness, and osteoporosis, as well a constellation of psychiatric, cardiovascular, and immunological deficiencies. Cushingâs disease - another less common cause of Cushingâs syndrome - is generally the result of increased endogenous cortisol exposure due to excessive secretion of adrenocroticotrophic hormone (ACTH) from a pituitary adenoma. The CYP11B1 enzyme is responsible for catalyzing the final step of cortisol synthesis - by inhibiting this enzyme, osilodrostat helps to normalize endogenous cortisol levels and alleviate symptoms of Cushingâs disease."
2002,DB11842,"Angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor indicated for increasing blood pressure in adults with septic or other distributive shock .Angiotensin II is under investigation for the treatment of Sepsis, Septic Shock, Diabetes Mellitus, and Acute Renal Failure. Angiotensin II has been investigated for the treatment, basic science, and diagnostic of Hypertension, Renin Angiotensin System, and Idiopathic Membranous Nephropathy. As distributive shock is the most common type of shock in the inpatient setting and affects up to one third of patients in the intensive care unit, the FDA determined that there is a need for treatment options for critically ill hypotensive patients who do not adequately respond to currently available therapies.Angiotensin II is a naturally occurring peptide hormone of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) that has the capacity to cause vasoconstriction and an increase in blood pressure in the human body. .As part of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS), angiotensin II raises blood pressure by vasoconstriction, increased aldosterone release by the adrenal zona glomerulosa, sodium and water reabsorption in the proximal tubular cells, and vasopressin secretion     The direct action of angiotensin II on surrounding vessel walls is facilitated by binding to the G-protein-coupled angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT-1) on vascular smooth muscle cells, which stimulates Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of myosin and causes smooth muscle contraction that results in vasoconstriction . The RAAS is ultimately regulated by a negative feedback effect of angiotensin II on renin production by the juxtaglomerular cells of the renal afferent arteriole."
2003,DB11850,"It is also indicated by the EMA to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features.CD20, an antigen expressed by various B and T cells, is an attractive therapeutic target in various cancers and autoimmune conditions. Monoclonal antibodies for B cell depletion rely on their binding affinity and ability to clear bound cells through mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), mediated by interactions between an antibody and FcÎ³ receptors on natural killer cells or macrophages. In December 2022, ublituximab was approved by the US FDA for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, becoming the first and only anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody for multiple sclerosis allowing for administration in a one-hour infusion twice-a-year following the starting dose. The next year, June 2023, ublituximab was also approved by the EMA for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis in adult patients.Treatment with ublituximab reduces CD19+ B-cell counts - used as a surrogate marker for CD20+ B-cells due to ublituximab's interference with the CD20 assay - within 24 hours of the initial infusion. Although several anti-CD20 antibodies have been developed, therapy has been hampered by low CD20 expression by malignant cells in diseases such as B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and suboptimal antibody-dependent cytotoxicity."
2004,DB11853,"Relugolix is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced prostate cancer.relugolix is indicated for the once-daily treatment for the management of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in premenopausal women.Relugolix is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist used in the treatment of several hormone-responsive conditions. This branded product was later approved by the European Commission on April 29, 2022. In addition to its relative ease-of-use, relugolix was shown to be superior in the depression of testosterone levels when compared to , another androgen deprivation therapy used in the treatment of prostate cancer.Approximately 56% of patients achieved castrate-level testosterone concentrations (<50 ng/dL) by day 4 of therapy and 97% of patients maintain these levels through 48 weeks of therapy. Androgen deprivation therapies may prolong the QTc interval and should therefore be used with caution in patients having a high baseline risk of QTc prolongation, such as those with electrolyte abnormalities, congestive heart failure, or using other medications known to prolong the QTc interval. Androgen deprivation has been demonstrated to result in cell death and tumor regression in many well-differentiated prostate cancer cell lines - for this reason, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has become a standard in the treatment of prostate cancer, particularly in advanced disease."
2005,DB11855,"Revefenacin is indicated as an inhalation solution for the maintenance treatment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). From the LAMA group, revefenacin is the first once-daily nebulized LAMA treatment. It was developed by Theravance Biopharma and FDA approved on November 9, 2018.Revefenacin has been reported to produce a sustained, long-acting bronchodilation with lower anti-muscarinic-related side effects. In clinical trials, revefenacin demonstrated to be of a long duration of action and low systemic exposure in patients with COPD. As well, there was a reported superior lung selectivity index when compared with other LAMAs such as glycopyrronium and tiotropium which produced a decreased sialagogue effect.Revefenacin is an inhaled bronchodilator muscarinic antagonist with a long-acting bronchodilation activity."
2006,DB11859,"Brexanolone is a synthetic neuroactive steroid gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA(a)) receptor positive modulator indicated for the treatment of postpartum depression (PPD) in adult women .As of March 2019, brexanolone - developed and made available commercially by Sage Therapeutics Inc. as the brand name product Zulresso - is the first drug to have ever been approved by the US FDA specifically for the treatment of postpartum depression (PPD) in adult females . In particular, the use of brexanolone in treating PPD is surrounded with promise because it acts in part as a synthetic supplement for possible deficiencies in endogenous brexanolone (allopregnanolone) in postpartum women susceptible to PPD whereas many commonly used anti-depressive medications elicit actions that may modulate the presence and activity of substances like serotonin, norepinephrine, and/or monoamine oxidase but do not mediate activities directly associated with PPD like natural fluctuations in the levels of endogenous neuroactive steroids like allopregnanolone . With enough chloride ions conducted, the local, associated neuron membrane potentials are hyperpolarized - making it more difficult or less likely for action potentials to fire, ultimately resulting in less excitation of the neurons, like those involved in neuronal pathways that may be in part responsible for eliciting certain traits of PPD like stress, anxiety, etc . In particular, within the context of PPD, it is proposed that endogenous brexanolone levels can quickly drop or fluctuate variedly after childbirth and that GABA(a) receptor levels and expression are decreased and down-regulated throughout pregnancy . As a medication, synthetic brexanolone can subsequently facilitate a return of positive allosteric modulator GABA(a) modulation while GABA(a) receptor levels and expression gradually return to normal in the time following postpartum ."
2007,DB11866,"Romosozumab is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in post menopausal women at high risk of fractures and also in patients with osteoperosis who are intolerant to other treatments or who have failed in other treatments.Romosozumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody indicated for the treatment of osteoperosis in postmenopausal women at high risk of fracture and patients who have failed in other treatments or are intolerant to other osteoperosis therapies. Romosozumab prevents bone resorption and induces the formation of bone though it is associated with an increased risk of cardiac death, heart attack, and stroke in one study. Romosozumab is marketed in the United States by Amgen under the brand name Evinity. Inhibition of this protein allows Wnt signalling in osteoblasts to promote bone formation and allows for the inhibition of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-beta-ligand (RANKL) mediated bone resorption by osteoclasts.Osteocytes secrete sclerostin which inhibits bone formation by binding to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related proteins 5 and 6 of osteoblasts, inhibiting the Wnt signal pathway. Romosozumab's inhibition of sclerostin also inhibits the increase in RANKL dependant increases in osteoclast activity and bone resorption."

In a phase-2 multicenter open-label study, 89% of patients with non-metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer had â¥50% PSA decline at week 12 of apalutamide treatment . Apalutamide was approved in February 2018 by the FDA as Erleada for the treatment of patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer that is resistant to treatment with hormone therapy (castration-resistant). Apalutamide demonstrated antitumor activity in the mouse xenograft models of prostate cancer, where it decreased tumor cell proliferation and reduced tumor volume.Persistent androgen receptor (AR) signaling is a common feature of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), attributed to AR gene amplification, AR gene mutation, increased AR expression, or increased androgen biosynthesis in prostate tumors. Apalutamide is an antagonist of AR that binds directly to the ligand-binding domain of the AR with the IC50 of 16 nM."
2010,DB11915,"Valbenazine is indicated for the treatment of adults with tardive dyskinesia and chorea associated with Huntingtonâs disease.Valbenazine is a modified metabolite of , and it is currently being approved for the treatment of various movement disorders, particularly tardive dyskinesia and chorea associated with Huntington's disease. Tardive dyskinesia has long been regarded as a consequence of anti-dopamine receptor therapy, and until 2008 with the advent of , most treatments were ineffective. The reduction in chorea severity was observed as early as 2 weeks after starting treatment with an initial dose of 40 mg.Valbenazine inhibits human VMAT2 (Ki ~ 150 nM) with no appreciable binding affinity for VMAT1 (Ki > 10 ÂµM). Valbenazine is converted to the active metabolite -Î±-dihydrotetrabenazine (-Î±-HTBZ). Based on this model, patients taking an valbenazine 60 mg or 80 mg dose with increased exposure to the metabolite (e.g., being a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer) may have a mean (upper bound of double-sided 90% CI) QT prolongation of 9.6 (12.0) msec or 11.7 (14.7) msec, respectively as compared to otherwise healthy volunteers given valbenazine, who had a respective mean (upper bound of double-sided 90% CI) QT prolongation of 5.3 (6.7) msec or 6.7 (8.4) msec.Although the exact mechanism of action of valbenzine is still unknown, it is thought be mediated through the reversible inhibition of vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), a transporter that regulates monoamine uptake from the cytoplasm to the synaptic vesicle for storage and release."
2011,DB11921,"Deflazacort is indicated for the treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) in patients 2 years of age and older.Deflazacort, also known as Emflaza, is a corticosteroid prodrug used as an agent to manage Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). It is marketed by Marathon Pharmaceuticals and was approved in February 2017 by the FDA. This allows for an increased quality of life and prevents the necessity for surgical procedures, such as those for scoliosis, which is associated with DMD. Studies showed significant preservation of muscle mass in patients generally treated with 0.9 mg/kg/day of deflazacort compared to a control group. **Effects on ambulation**    Ambulation was significantly higher by 12 years of age and 18 years of age in patients taking deflazacort when compared with the control group."
2012,DB11932,"The necessity for follow-up treatment may lead to challenges with patient adherence, and resistance to agents like permethrin and / may be significant in some areas. Abemetapir is an inhibitor of these metalloproteinase enzymes, and the first topical pediculicide to take advantage of this novel target. The improved ovicidal activity (90-100% _in vitro_) of abemetapir allows for a single administration, in contrast to many other topical treatments, and its novel and relatively non-specific mechanism may help to curb the development of resistance to this agent. Its predominant metabolite, abametapir carboxyl, has a prolonged residence time in the body, with an estimated half-life of 71 Â± 40 hours or longer in adults - as this metabolite has been shown to inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes _in vitro_, the use of substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2B6, or CYP1A2 should be avoided for two weeks following the administration of abametapir. Abametapir is a metalloproteinase inhibitor that targets louse metalloproteinases which are critical to their development and hatching."
2013,DB11936,"Bempedoic acid is indicated as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or existing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease that warrants additional lowering of LDL-C.    High levels of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) are a major risk factor for cardiovascular events. For increased control of LDL cholesterol levels in patients experiencing refractory elevations despite previous statin treatment.Bempedoic acid inhibits the synthesis of cholesterol in the liver, reducing LDL-C levels. The effects of bempedoic acid on mortality are currently unknown.Normally, LDL cholesterol is produced in the liver and circulates in the blood. Bempedoic acid is a prodrug that requires activation in the liver. This inhibition leads to upregulation of the LDL cholesterol receptor, reducing serum LDL-C via increased uptake and LDL clearance in the liver."
2014,DB11942,"Selinexor was also granted accelerated approval for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) that have gone through at least 2 lines of systemic therapy. The use of selinexor in combination with  and  was approved by Health Canada in June 2022 for the treatment of multiple myeloma in adult patients who have received at least one prior therapy.Selinexor causes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells.Selinexor binds to and inhibits exportin-1 (XPO1). XPO1 is a nuclear exporter protein which contains a pocket to which nuclear proteins can bind. When complexed with these proteins and Ran, activated through guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding, the XPO1-protein-Ran-GTP complex is able to exit the nucleus through a nuclear pore. The inhibition of this process in cancer cells allows the targets of XPO1, many of which are tumor suppressors, to collect in the nucleus and result in increased transcription of tumor suppressor genes."

Whereas historically popular pharmacologic treatments for insomnia (e.g. , , benzodiazepines) focus on enhancing sleep drive via modulation of GABA and melatonin receptors, lemborexant and other orexin antagonists (e.g. ) act to counteract inappropriate wakefulness. Episodes of complex sleep behaviors (e.g. eating food, having sex, making phone calls) have been reported in patients using lemborexant - these events may occur in hypnotic-naive and hyponotic-experienced patients, and patients are unlikely to remember these events. Patients exhibiting complex sleep behaviors should discontinue lemborexant immediately. Lemborexant is an competitive antagonist of OX1R and OX2R."
2018,DB11952,"Duvelisib is indicated for the treatment of relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) in adult patients who have trialed at least two prior therapies.Duvelisib, also known as IPI-145 and INK-1197, is a small-molecule inhibitor of phosphoinositide-3 kinases that was designed initially to prove that simultaneous inhibition of the isoforms delta and gamma can produce a broad adaptative and innate immune cell inhibitory activity. All the work around duvelisib showed that this agent is a potent inhibitor of both forms. This trials reported a median progression-free survival of 16.4 months and an overall response rate of 78% which were almost 2-fold what it was reported for ofatumumab. Hence, inhibition of PI3K can provide an inhibition of the signaling from BCR, inhibition of a cytokine signaling from the microenvironment and enhancement of anti-tumor immunity. In summary, duvelisib inhibits the isoform delta of PI3K which is necessary for cell proliferation and survival and the isoform gamma which is critical for cytokine signaling and the pro-inflammatory response."

Lymphocytes leave the lymphoid organs in response to higher concentrations of S1P in blood and lymph."
2034,DB12020,"Tecovirimat is an inhibitor of the orthopoxvirus VP37 envelope wrapping protein and is indicated for the treatment of human smallpox disease in adults and pediatric patients weighing at least 3 kg. Tecovirimat was approved by the FDA in July 2018 as the first drug ever approved to treat smallpox. Other than smallpox, tecovirimat is also indicated to treat complications due to replication of the vaccinia virus following vaccination against smallpox, and to treat monkeypox and cowpox in adults and children. The formation of a wrapping complex for enveloped virions is mediated by the orthopoxvirus P37 protein. Interaction of P37 and Rab9 GTPase and TIP47 leads to the formation of the virus-specific wrapping complex for enveloped virions."
2035,DB12023,"Benralizumab is indicated as a maintenance treatment of patients 12 years or older with severe asthma and an eosinophilic phenotype. In the TH2-high phenotype, IL-5 presents a central role as it is responsible for eosinophil differentiation, survival, activation and migration to the lungs.Benralizumab is a humanized recombinant monoclonal antibody of the isotype IgG1k immunoglobulin that specifically binds to the alpha chain of the interleukin 5 receptor (IL-5R) expressed on eosinophils and basophils. On the other hand, Benralizumab binding to natural killer cells FcÎ³RIIIÎ± receptor produces a direct antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. All these effects produce a reduction in eosinophil count in airway mucosa, submucosa, sputum, blood and bone marrow.Interleukin-5 (IL-5) induces an eosinophil-mediated inflammatory response by binding to the IL-5 receptor (IL-5R) expressed in eosinophils, basophils and some mast cells. On the other hand, Benralizumab is an afucosylated antibody in the CH2 region which gives it a high affinity for the FcÎ³RIIIa on natural killer cells, macrophages and neutrophils."
2036,DB12026,"Voxilaprevir is a Direct-Acting Antiviral (DAA) medication used as part of combination therapy to treat chronic Hepatitis C, an infectious liver disease caused by infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). By inhibiting viral protease NS3/4A, voxilaprevir therefore prevents viral replication and function. Vosevi is approved for the treatment of adult patients with chronic HCV infection with genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 infection . Prior to Vosevi, there were no approved retreatment options for patients who have previously received, and failed, a regimen containing an NS5A inhibitor for treatment of chronic HCV infection.Voxilaprevir is a direct-acting antiviral agent that targets viral NS3/4A protein and causes a decrease in serum HCV RNA levels. By inhibiting viral protease NS3/4A, voxilaprevir therefore prevents viral replication and function."
2037,DB12035,"Sarecycline is a tetracycline-class drug indicated for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients 9 years of age and older .Sarecycline is a semi-synthetic derivative of tetracycline that was initially discovered by Paratek Pharmaceuticals from Boston, MA but then licensed to Warner Chilcott of Rockaway, NJ in July of 2007 . Seysara (sarecycline) was originally part of Allergan's US Medical Dermatology portfolio, before Almirall acquired the portfolio in the second half of 2018 as a means of consolidating and reinforcing the dermatology-focused pharmaceutical company's presence in the United States . Subsequently, while a number of first line tetracycline therapies like doxycycline and minocycline do exist for treating acne vulgaris, sarecycline presents a new and innovative therapy choice because it exhibits the necessary antibacterial activity against relevant pathogens that cause acne vulgaris but also possesses a low propensity for resistance development in such pathogens and a narrower, more specific spectrum of antibacterial activity, resulting in fewer off-target antibacterial effects on endogenous intestinal flora and consequently fewer resultant adverse effects associated with diarrhea, fungal overgrowth, etc.Compared to various examples of first-line tetracycline therapies for moderate to severe acne like doxycycline and minocycline, studies have shown that sarecycline can be sixteen to thirty-two fold less active against aerobic Gram-negative bacilli present within the normal human intestinal microbiome . Moreover, sarecycline also shares a relatively low propensity for resistance development in Cutibacterium acnes - one of the principal anaerobic organisms associated with acne lesions - with doxycycline and minocycline treatments .It has been demonstrated that tetracyclines like sarecycline elicit their antimicrobial action by targeting and inhibiting protein synthesis in microbial agents like Cutibacterium acnes present in acne lesions . In addition, because Cutibacterium acnes also generates proteins and enzymes that are capable of causing inflammation, it is also believed that tetracyclines like sarecyclines can also affect an anti-inflammatory effect via the inhibition of such microbial protein synthesis ."
2038,DB12070,"It is also indicated for prophylaxis against CMV disease in adult kidney transplant recipients who are at risk (i.e. donor CMV-seropositive/recipient CMV-seronegative).Letermovir recieved approval from the FDA on November 8th, 2017 for use in prophylaxis of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients. It is currently marketed under the brand name Prevymis.Letermovir inhibits the activity of the DNA terminase complex of CMV thereby preventing the cutting of viral DNA into mature length genomes for packaging into viral particles. Letemovir inhibits the DNA terminase complex with an EC50 of 2.1nM.CMV relies on a DNA terminase complex consisting of multiple subunits (pUL51, pUL56, and pUL89) for processing of viral DNA. Letemovir inhibits the activity of this complex to prevent production of mature viral genomes and the production of viable viral particles. The exact nature of Letemovir's binding to this complex is not currently known."
2039,DB12095,"Currently, telotristat ethyl is used to treat carcinoid syndrome diarrhea from neuroendocrine tumors that are inadequately controlled by short-acting somatostatin analog (SSA) treatment. The first line treatment of carcinoid syndrome diarrhea is SSA, but symptoms still reoccur over the course of the disease.In normal mice, telotristat etiprate (administered once daily for 4 days at doses of 15â300 mg/kg/day) was found to reduce serotonin levels throughout the gastrointestinal tract. These reductions occurred in a dose dependent fashion with maximal effects observed with doses of telotristat etiprate â¥150 mg/kg. Serotonin plays a role in mediating secretion, motility, inflammation, and sensation of the  gastrointestinal tract, and is over-produced in patients with carcinoid syndrome. Through inhibition of tryptophan hydroxylase, telotristat and telotristat ethyl reduce the production of peripheral serotonin, and the frequency of carcinoid syndrome diarrhea."
2040,DB12107,"In August 2017, a combination antibacterial therapy under the market name Vabomere was approved by the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI). The treatment aims to resolve infection-related symptoms of cUTI and achieve negative urine culture, when the infections are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria.Vaborbactam shows no antibacterial activity alone; it serves to restore the antibacterial activity of other antibacterial agents such as meropenem by attenuating their degradation by inhibiting certain serine beta-lactamases of microorganisms. Vaborbactam in combination with meropenem, which is a penem antibacterial drug, potentiates the bactericidal actions of meropenem against carbapenem-resistant KPC-containing _Escherichia coli_, _Klebsiella pneumoniae_, and _Enterobacter cloacae_ in a concentration-dependent manner. It restored the antimicrobial activity of meropenem in animal models of infection caused by some meropenem non-susceptible KPC-producing Enterobacteriaceae.Vaborbactam is a cyclic boronic acid pharmacophore Î²-lactamase inhibitor that elicits potent inhibition of _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemase (KPC) enzymes and other Ambler class A and C enzymes such as serine Î²-lactamases that confer resistance to commonly-used antibiotics such as Carbapenems. Vaborbactam is a potent inhibitor of class A carbapenemases, such as KPC, as well as an inhibitor of other class A (CTX-M, SHV, TEM) and class C (P99, MIR, FOX) beta-lactamases."
2041,DB12130,"Lorlatinib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with ALK-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In the EU, it is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC not previously treated with an ALK inhibitor, or whose disease has progressed after using either  or , or  and at least one other ALK inhibitor.Lorlatinib is a third-generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) for patients with ALK-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer which was first approved by the US FDA in November of 2018. In 295 patients who received lorlatinib at the recommended dosage of 100 mg once daily and had an ECG measurement in the same Study B7461001, the maximum mean change from baseline for their PR interval was 16.4 ms (2-sided 90% upper confidence interval  19.4 ms) . Among the 284 patients with PR interval <200 ms at baseline, 14% had PR interval prolongation â¥200 ms after starting use with lorlatinib . Subsequnetly, lorlatinib is a kinase inhibitor with in vitro activity against ALK and number of other tyrosine kinase receptor related targets including ROS1, TYK1, FER, FPS, TRKA, TRKB, TRKC, FAK, FAK2, and ACK ."
2042,DB12141,"Gilteritinib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients who have relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia with an FLT3 mutation detected by an FDA-approved test. Acute myeloid leukemia is cancer that impacts the blood and bone marrow with a rapid progression. It is a pyrazinecarboxamide derivative that showed high selectivity to FLT3 preventing the c-Kit -driven myelosuppression observed in other therapies. As well, data showed a gilteritinib-driven inhibition of the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL which is known to modulate the activity of FLT3 in acute myeloid leukemia. In phase III clinical trials, gilteritinib reported a complete remission or complete remission with partial hematologic recovery in 21% of the patients.Gilteritinib is a potent selective inhibitor of both of the mutations, internal tandem duplication (ITD) and tyrosine kinase domain (TKD), of the FLT3 receptor."
2043,DB12147,"Erdafitinib is a pan-fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma that has susceptible FGFR3 or FGFR2 genetic alterations and has progressed during or following at least one line of prior platinum-containing chemotherapy including within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant platinum-containing chemotherapy. The selection of patients for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma with erdafitinib should be based on the presence of susceptible FGFR genetic alterations in tumor specimens as detected by an FDA-approved companion diagnostic like the FDA-approved therascreen FGFR RGQ RT-PCR Kit as developed by QIAGEN. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.In early April of 2019, the US FDA approved Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies' brand name Balversa (erdafitinib) as the first-ever fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) kinase inhibitor indicated for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, with susceptible FGFR3 or FGFR2 genetic alterations, that has progressed during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, including within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant platinum-containing chemotherapy. Additionally, the concomitant use of agents that can alter serum phosphate levels before the initial erdafitinib dose increase period based on serum phosphate levels was also avoided. Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) is a transmembrane protein that is expressed ubiquitously in normal tissues and is involved in various endogenous bio-physiological processes including the homeostasis of phosphate and vitamin D, cell proliferation, cell anti-apoptotic signaling, and cell migration in a variety of cell types."
2044,DB12151,"Brincidofovir is indicated for the treatment of human smallpox disease in adult and pediatric patients.Brincidofovir is an oral antiviral drug used in the treatment of human smallpox infections. Brincidofovir, developed by Chimerix under the brand name Tembexa, was approved by the FDA for the treatment of smallpox infection in June 2021. Regimens involving a longer duration of administration (i.e. more than a single dose on days 1 and 8) have been shown to increase mortality compared to placebo and should therefore be avoided. Brincidofovir is considered a potential human carcinogen and has demonstrated the potential to cause infertility - as such, its use should be restricted to situations in which it is absolutely necessary.Brincidofovir is a pro-drug comprising  conjugated to a lipid molecule - the lipid component mimics an endogenous lipid, lysophosphatidylcholine, which allows the molecule to hijack endogenous lipid uptake pathways to enter infected cells. In addition, cidofovir is an acyclic nucleotide analogue of deoxycytidine monophosphate - cidofovir diphosphate can therefore be incorporated into the growing viral DNA chain and consequently slow the rate of viral DNA synthesis."
2045,DB12159,"In the US, dupilumab is indicated for the treatment of patients aged six months and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when those therapies are not advisable. In Europe and Canada, the drug for this indication is approved for patients aged six years and older. In the US and Europe, dupilumab is also indicated for the treatment of adults and children aged 12 years and older weighing at least 40 kg with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), and adults with prurigo nodularis.Dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin G4 subclass that binds to the interleukin-4 (IL-4) receptor, inhibiting the receptor signaling pathways. As an interleukin-4 receptor alpha antagonist, dupilumab inhibits the signaling of pro-inflammatory cytokines, called interleukins (IL), that induce inflammatory and immunological reactions in several atopic or allergic conditions, such as eczema, allergic reaction, and rhinosinusitis. It is also being studied in combination with another antibody that which targets IL-33.Dupilumab is an recombinant human IgG4 antibody to the IL-4 receptor that works by inhibiting the activation of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines that are implicated in the pathophysiology of several allergic and atopic conditions, including asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and food and environmental allergies."
2046,DB12161,"As with other agents for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, deutetrabenazine is a drug to alleviate the motor symptoms of HD and is not proposed to halt the progression of the disease . It was approved by FDA in April 2017 and is marketed under the trade name Austedo as oral tablets.In clinical trials, there was an evidence of clinical effectiveness of deutetrabenazine in improving the symptoms of involuntary movements in patient with tardive dyskinesia by reducing the mean Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) score . Effects at higher exposures to deutetrabenazine or its metabolites have not been evaluated . After a single oral dose of radiolabeled deutetrabenazine, radioactivity was still detected in eye and fur at 35 days following dosing . Placed at key positions, deuterium forms a stronger hydrogen bond with carbon that requires more energy for cleavage, thus attenuating CYP2D6-mediated metabolism without having any effect on the therapeutic target ."
2047,DB12169,"Tralokinumab is indicated in Canada, the US, and the EU for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in patients who are candidates for systemic therapy and are inadequately controlled with topical interventions. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is an inflammatory skin disorder that causes skin inflammation, skin barrier dysfunction, and chronic pruritus. It also reduced epidermal thickness and decreased the expression of Keratin 16 and Ki-67 in skin affected by atopic dermatitis. Patients becoming infected during the course of therapy may be treated with anti-helminth medications, but should discontinue tralokinumab if the infection fails to resolve.Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that has been implicated as the primary driver of atopic dermatitis (AD). IL-13 binds with high affinity to both a heterodimeric form of IL-13RÎ±1 - complexed with IL-4RÎ± - and to IL-13RÎ±2, both of which are expressed on keratinocytes and fibroblasts."
2048,DB12184,"Gepirone is indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults. Gepirone, an azapirone, is a pharmacologic analog of  that acts selectively on the pre- and post-synaptic 5HT1A receptors. Although earlier clinical trials showed promising results for gepirone, its formulation as an immediate-release tablet necessitates frequent administration due to the short half-lives. It was not until an extended-release formulation of gepirone was made available that gepirone became a potential candidate for a new antidepressant. Gepirone was approved by the FDA on September 28, 2023, under the brand name EXXUA for the treatment of adults with major depressive disorder."
2049,DB12218,"Capivasertib, in combination with fulvestrant, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with one or more PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-alteration as detected by an FDA-approved test following progression on at least one endocrine-based regimen in the metastatic setting or recurrence on or within 12 months of completing adjuvant therapy.Hormone receptor (HR) positive, especially estrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer is the most common subtype of metastatic breast cancer, resulting in more than 400,000 deaths annually. Although endocrine-based therapy is the first line of treatment, resistance eventually emerges, leaving chemotherapy the only but often ineffective treatment left. Therefore, significant research has been put into developing genetically targeted treatments. The PIK3/AKT pathway is one of the most commonly activated pathways in breast cancer, mainly through the constitutively active mutation in AKT1, loss of function mutation in PTEN, a negative regulator of the PIK3/AKT pathway, or PIK3CA mutations. Therefore, targeting the PIK3/AKT pathway presents a promising approach for the treatment of breast cancer, leading to the development of capivasertib, a pan-AKT kinase inhibitor."
2050,DB12235,"Estetrol is indicated for the prevention of pregnancy.Naturally or synthetically produced steroid estrogens have a wide range of pharmaceutical uses ranging from hormonal contraception to the treatment of menopausal symptoms. Estetrol (E4) is a native estrogen occurring naturally during pregnancy, but can be synthesized from a plant source and used for contraception. It is more potent and is safer than the synthetic estrogen ethinylestradiol (EE2) found in 97% of oral contraceptive pills, reducing the environmental accumulation of unwanted endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that often lead to harmful epigenetic effects. On April 15 2021, Mayne Pharma Group Limited and Mithra Pharmaceuticals were granted FDA approval for the oral contraceptive Estelle/Nextstellis, a combination of  and estetrol. Estetrol is the first new estrogen introduced to the USA in over 50 years and is the first approved estetrol product in the world."
2051,DB12236,"Bexagliflozin is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.Bexagliflozin is a highly specific and potent sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor. Its use is not recommended in patients with type 1 diabetes since it may increase their risk of diabetic ketoacidosis.Healthy subjects and adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus given single or multiple doses of bexagliflozin had dose-dependent increases in urinary glucose excretion (UGE) accompanied by increases in urine volume. In addition, the use of bexagliflozin in patients treated with insulin and insulin secretagogues may increase the risk of hypoglycemia.Bexagliflozin is a highly selective sodiumâglucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor. SGLT2 is located in the proximal renal tubule, a part of the kidney where most reabsorption takes place, and they transport glucose and sodium from the tubular lumen to the epithelium. Therefore, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), bexagliflozin reduces blood glucose levels independently of insulin sensitivity."
2052,DB12240,"Polatuzumab vedotin is used to treat adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified, after at least two prior therapies. Polatuzumab vedotin was granted accelerated FDA approval on June 10, 2019  and was approved by Health Canada on July 9, 2020.Polatuzumab vedotin is an anti-cancer agent that works to cause apoptosis in malignant B cells. _In vitro_, it exerted cytotoxic effects on most diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines: this effect was consistent across cell lines, regardless of the cell-of-origin subtypes and whether they harboured mutations in the _CD79B_ gene or not. Polatuzumab vedotin can cause immunosuppression, including neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.Polatuzumab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate consisting of a CD79b-directed antibody, a microtubule-disrupting agent called monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), and a cleavable linker that holds the components together. MMAE is a microtubule-disrupting anti-mitotic agent that exerts cytotoxic effects against malignant B cells."
2053,DB12245,"This drug is indicated for the treatment of fascioliasis in patients aged 6 years old and above.Triclabendazole, manufactured by Novartis pharmaceuticals, is an antihelminthic drug that was approved by the FDA in February 2019 for the treatment of fascioliasis in humans. These parasites can infect humans following ingestion of larvae in contaminated water or food. Triclabendazole and its metabolites are active against both the immature and mature worms of _Fasciola hepatica_ and  _Fasciola gigantica_ helminths. **Effect on QT interval**    This drug may prolong the cardiac QT interval. In vitro studies and animal studies suggest that triclabendazole and its active metabolites (_sulfoxide_ and _sulfone_) are absorbed by the outer body covering of the immature and mature worms, causing a reduction in the resting membrane potential, the inhibition of tubulin function as well as protein and enzyme synthesis necessary for survival."
2054,DB12255,"Vadadustat is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic anemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults on chronic maintenance dialysis.One of the most common symptoms of advanced renal disease is anemia, caused primarily by the inability of the kidney to respond to anemic conditions with a corresponding increase in  (EPO) production. These transcription factors serve a multitude of roles, including the stimulation of erythropoiesis. Vadadustat is an orally administered inhibitor of HIF-PH with a safety and efficacy profile non-inferior to  for the treatment of anemia in patients with CKD undergoing dialysis. Vadadustat did not meet the prespecified noninferiority criterion for cardiovascular safety in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD.The use of vadadustat was compared to darbepoetin alfa for the treatment of anemia in adult patients with dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease. The use of vadadustat may also lead to the development of thromboembolic events, hepatic impairment, hepatotoxicity, convulsions, as well as an increase in blood pressure.Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are transcription factors responsible for cellular survival under hypoxic conditions."
2055,DB12265,"Due to the decreased efficacy observed in patients with severe second stage HAT (cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count (CSF-WBC) >100 cells/Î¼L), fexinidazole should only be used in these patients if there are no other available treatment options.Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT, also colloquially referred to as sleeping sickness), caused by T. brucei gambiense and T. brucei rhodesiense, remains a moderate risk (>1/10,000 inhabitants per year in endemic areas) despite focussed control efforts. In addition, fexinidazole has been associated with neutropenia and elevations in liver transaminases, which should be monitored.Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) is caused by two subspecies of Trypanosoma brucei, T. brucei gambiense and T. brucei rhodesiense, with T. brucei gambiense HAT accounting for ~97% of the total disease burden. Fexinidazole is the first all-oral treatment for T. brucei gambiense HAT. However, it is suggested that bacterial-like nitroreductases encoded by trypanosomes activate fexinidazole and its M1/M2 metabolites through reduction to form reactive intermediates capable of damaging DNA and proteins. Therefore, fexinidazole is capable of direct toxicity against trypanosomes throughout the body and in the brain, which is consistent with its efficacy against both early and late-stage infections."
2056,DB12267,"The ALK-related cases of NSCLC are associated with the presence of the fusion gene EML4-ALK which fused the ALK protein with the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein like-4 whose original function is the correct formation of microtubules. Thus, brigatinib is indicated for the treatment of patients with ALK+ NSCLC with intolerance to Crizotinib.Brigatinib, originally named AP26113, is a reversible dual inhibitor of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). It also exhibits selectivity against 9 different Crizotinib-resistant mutants of the EML4-ALK fusion gene, which is a pivotal player in the transformation of susceptible lung parenchyma. Brigatinib was developed by Ariad Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, and FDA-approved on April 28, 2017.Brigitanib inhibits proliferation and in vitro viability of cells expressing the fusion protein EML4-ALK as well as 17 crizotinib-resistant ALK mutants. Brigitanib acts as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with activity against multiple kinases including ALK, ROS1, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor and against EGFR deletions and point mutations."

Propiverine hydrochloride is a bladder detrusor muscle relaxant drug with dual antimuscarinic and calcium-modulating properties for the treatment of OAB . In animal models, this administration of this drug leads to a dose-dependent decrease in intravesical pressure of the bladder and an increase in bladder capacity . Propiverine blocks calcium ion influx and modulates the intracellular calcium in urinary bladder smooth muscle cells, resulting in the inhibition of muscle spasm . Acetylcholine is the main contractile neurotransmitter in the human bladder detrusor muscle, and antimuscarinics such as propiverine exert their effects by competitively inhibiting the binding of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors on detrusor smooth muscle cells and other structures within the bladder wall ."
2059,DB12301,"Doravirine is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adult patients with no prior antiretroviral treatment history. Doravirine is formally indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adult patients with no prior antiretroviral treatment experience, further expanding the possibility and choice of therapeutic treatments available for the management of HIV-1 infection.In a clinical phase 2 trial evaluating a dose range of 0.25-2x the recommended dose of doravirine (in combination with emtricitabine/tenofovir) in HIV-1 infected subjects with no antiretroviral treatment history, no exposure-response relationship for efficacy was identified for doravirine. Reverse transcriptase is the enzyme with which HIV generates complementary DNA (cDNA) to its RNA genome - this cDNA is then inserted into the host cell genome, where it can be transcribed into viral RNA for the purposes of replication. Doravirine inhibits HIV-1 replication by non-competitively inhibiting HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. Doravirine does not, however, inhibit the human cellular DNA polymerases Î±, Ã, and mitochondrial DNA polymerase Î³."

2061,DB12332,"Under accelerated approval by the FDA, rucaparib is also indicated for the treatment of adult patients with a deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic)-associated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have been treated with androgen receptor-directed therapy and a taxane-based chemotherapy.Rucaparib is an anticancer drug and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor. By targeting the genetically-mutated cancer cells that lack a DNA repair mechanism, rucaparib causes cancer cell death and reduces tumour growth. Rucaparib decreases tumour growth in tumour cell lines with deficiencies in BRCA1/2 and other DNA repair genes. Rucaparib can also cause vasodilation, which may increase tumour perfusion and enhance the accumulation of cytotoxic drugs in cancer cells.PARPs play a role in DNA repair by activating DNA damage response pathways, such as base excision repair, and facilitating DNA repair. HR DNA repair pathways repair double-strand breaks; however, HR-deficient cancer cells lack this repair mechanism."

It is considered to be a last-line treatment option and gained FDA approval as part of the combination product Recarbrioâ in July 2019.Relebactam prevents the hydrolysis of , allowing it to exert its bactericidal effect.Relebactam is a beta-lactamase inhibitor known to inhibit many types of beta-lactamases including Ambler class A and Ambler class C enzymes, helping to prevent  from degrading in the body. Similar to the structurally-related , first, relebactam binds non-covalently to a beta-lactamase binding site, then, it covalently acylates the serine residue in the active site of the enzyme."
2065,DB12404,"Remimazolam is indicated for the induction and maintenance of procedural sedation in adults undergoing procedures lasting 30 minutes or less.Remimazolam is an ultra short-acting benzodiazepine used in the induction and maintenance of sedation during short (<30 minute) procedures. Recent trends in anesthesia-related drug development have touted the benefits of so-called ""soft drugs"" - these agents, such as , are designed to be metabolically fragile and thus susceptible to rapid biotransformation and elimination as inactive metabolites. It is considered an ""ultra short-acting"" benzodiazepine that achieves peak sedation within 3 to 3.5 minutes following intravenous administration, a property that makes it desirable for use during short procedures. As of its approval date, remimazolam has not received a scheduling action by the DEA under the Controlled Substances Act. As benzodiazepines as a class have been implicated in the development of drug dependence and have a known potential for abuse, remimazolam should be used with caution in patients with a history of drug dependence or abuse.Like other benzodiazepines, remimazolam exerts its therapeutic effects by potentiating the effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on GABA(A) receptors, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the mammalian brain."
2066,DB12455,"Omadacycline is indicated for the treatment of community acquired bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections caused by omadacycline-susceptible organisms in adults.Omadacycline has been used in trials studying the treatment of Bacterial Pneumonia, Bacterial Infections, Community-Acquired Infections, and Skin Structures and Soft Tissue Infections. Omadacycline represents a significant advance over the well-known tetracycline family, and has been shown to be highly effective in animal models at treating increasingly problematic, clinically prevalent infections caused by gram-positive bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and by gram-negative, atypical and anaerobic bacteria, including those resistant to currently available classes of antibiotics and known to cause diseases such as pneumonias, urinary tract infections, skin diseases and blood-borne infections in both the hospital and community settings.Omadacycline can be either bacteriostatic or bacteriocidal depending on the organism involved. It disrupts bacterial protein synthesis without affecting DNA, RNA, or peptidoglycan synthesis. Omadacycline represents an improvement over existing tetracycline agents as it has not been found to be subject to tetracycline resistance mediated by tetracycline efflux pumps encoded by the tet(K), tet(L), and tet(B) or to ribosomal protection proteins encoded by tet(O) and tet(M). Omadacycline is susceptible to RNA mutations which confer resistance to tetracyclines.Omadacycline binds to the primary tetracycline binding site on the bacterial 30s ribosomal subunit with high specificity."
2067,DB12457,"Rimegepant is also indicated for the prevention of episodic migraine in adults.Rimegepant is an oral antagonist of the CGRP receptor developed by Biohaven Pharmaceuticals. While several parenteral antagonists of CGRP and its receptor have been approved for migraine therapy (e.g. , , ), rimegepant and  were the only CGRP antagonists that possessed oral bioavailability until the approval of  in 2021. Antagonism of the CGRP pathway has become an attractive target for migraine therapy as, unlike the triptans, oral CGRP antagonists have no observed vasoconstrictive properties and are therefore safer for use in patients with contraindications to standard therapy.Rimegepant helps to abort migraine headaches by preventing the activity of a pronociceptive molecule that has been implicated in migraine pathophysiology. Hypersensitivity reactions have occurred during clinical studies and patients should be made aware of this possibility. The trigeminal ganglion appears to amplify and perpetuate the migraine headache pain through the activation of perivascular fibers and the release of molecules involved in pain generation, such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)."
2068,DB12466,"In 2014, favipiravir was approved in Japan to treat cases of influenza that were unresponsive to conventional treatment. Given its efficacy at targetting several strains of influenza, it has been investigated in other countries to treat novel viruses including Ebola and most recently, COVID-19.Discovered by Toyama Chemical Co., Ltd. in Japan, favipiravir is a modified pyrazine analog that was initially approved for therapeutic use in resistant cases of influenza. The active favipiravir-RTP selectively inhibits RNA polymerase and prevents replication of the viral genome. There are several hypotheses as to how favipiravir-RTP interacts with RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Although favipiravir was originally developed to treat influenza, the RdRp catalytic domain (favipiravir's primary target), is expected to be similar for other RNA viruses."
2069,DB12471,"It is also indicated for the reduction in the incidence of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis.Ibrexafungerp, also known as SCY-078 or MK-3118, is a novel enfumafungin derivative oral triterpene antifungal approved for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), also known as a vaginal yeast infection. It was developed out of a need to treat fungal infections that may have become resistant to echinocandins or azole antifungals. Ibrexafungerp is orally bioavailable compared to the echinocandins , , and ; which can only be administered parenterally. Similar to echinocandins, ibrexafungerp targets the fungal Î²-1,3-glucan synthase, which is not present in humans, limiting the chance of renal or hepatic toxicity. Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of fetal toxicity.Î²-1,3-glucan synthase is composed of a catalytic subunit, FKS1 or FKS2, and a GTP-binding regulatory subunit, Rho1."
2070,DB12473,"Taurolidine is indicated  to reduce the incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) in adult patients with kidney failure receiving chronic hemodialysis (HD) through a central venous catheter (CVC). Taurolidine is an antimicrobial used for the prevention of catheter-related infections. It is a derivative of the amino acid . It was first synthesized in the 1970s and was originally used as a prophylactic against intraperitoneal bacterial infections in patients with peritonitis. In November 2023, a catheter lock solution of taurolidine in combination with  - marketed as Defencath - received FDA approval under the Limited Population Pathway for Antibacterial and Antifungal Drugs (LPAD pathway) for the prevention of catheter-related bloodstream infections in a limited and specific patient population.Taurolidine is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial with activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, in addition to mycobacteria and certain strains of fungi."
2071,DB12483,"PI3K, a lipid kinase that activates downstream signalling pathways involved in cell survival and growth, that exists in different isoforms and is often overexpressed in hematological malignancies. Copanlisib was granted accelerated approval by the FDA in September 2017 for the treatment of follicular lymphoma.Copanlisib is a kinase inhibitor with anti-tumour and pro-apoptotic activity in various tumour cell lines and xenograft models. Copanlisib causes an elevation in plasma glucose levels.Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) signalling pathway is implicated in cell proliferation and survival, as well as resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. Copanlisib is a class I PI3K inhibitor with preferential activity against PI3K-Î± and PI3K-Î´ isoforms expressed in malignant B cells. Copanlisib inhibits several key cell signalling pathways, including B-cell receptor (BCR) signalling, CXCR12-mediated chemotaxis of malignant B cells, and NFÎºB signalling in lymphoma cell lines."
2072,DB12489,"Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.Mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx (IMGN853) is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) formed by a monoclonal antibody (M9346A) that targets folate receptor alpha (FRÎ±), covalently joined by a cleavable disulfide linker to the genotoxic compound DM4 (also known as soravtansine or ravtansine). The antibody component of mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx binds to FRÎ±, a receptor overexpressed on the surface of epithelial tumor cells, characteristic of ovarian, endometrial, triple-negative breast and non-small-cell lung cancers. DM4 leads to cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis and is also able to diffuse into neighboring cells and induce further cell death. Since mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx contains DM4, a genotoxic compound, the use of this drug may cause embryo-fetal harm in pregnant women.Mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) formed by three components: a chimeric IgG1 antibody against folate receptor alpha (FRÎ±), the small molecule anti-tubulin agent DM4 (a maytansine derivative) and a sulfo-SPDB linker that joins DM4 to the mirvetuximab antibody. However, abnormally high levels of FRÎ± have been detected in serous and endometrioid epithelial ovarian cancer, endometrial adenocarcinoma, and nonâsmall cell lung cancer of the adenocarcinoma subtype."
2073,DB12498,"On August 8 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved mogamulizumab injection (also known as _Poteligeo_) for intravenous use for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mycosis fungoides (MF) or SÃ©zary syndrome (SS) after at least one prior systemic therapy. It was approved for the same indications in Canada in June 2022. Mogamulizumab is derived from Kyowa Hakko Kirin's POTELLIGENT (Â®) technology, which produces antibodies with enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity. Approval in Japan was granted on April 30 2012 by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare for patients with relapsed or refractory CCR4-positive adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma.This drug is a CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) antagonist. CCR4, a G-coupled-protein receptor for C-C chemokines such MIP-1, RANTES, TARC and MCP-1, is expressed on the surfaces of some types of T cells, endothelial cells, and certain types of neurons."
2074,DB12499,"Clascoterone is indicated for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris in patients 12 years of age and older.Clascoterone (cortexolone 17Î±-propionate, CB-03-01) is a novel antagonist of androgen receptors. By competing with androgens for binding to androgen receptors, clascoterone works by blocking the androgen receptor signalling cascades that promote acne pathogenesis, such as sebaceous gland proliferation, excess sebum production, and inflammatory pathways. Clascoterone is also being investigated as a novel treatment for androgenetic alopecia.Clascoterone exerts anti-androgenic effects by working as an antagonist at androgen receptors (ARs) expressed throughout the skin, including sebaceous glands, sebocytes, and dermal papilla cells. Clascoterone blocks the effects of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which are androgens that bind to the ARs and contribute to the development of androgen-dependent conditions such as acne and alopecia. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) binds to ARs expressed on dermal papilla cells (DPC) in the scalp to induce AR-mediated transcription of genes that contribute to androgenic alopecia."
2075,DB12500,"Fedratinib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk primary or secondary (post-polycythemia vera or post-essential thrombocythemia) myelofibrosis.Fedratinib, also known as SAR302503 and TG101348, is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat intermediate-2 and high risk primary and secondary myelofibrosis. It is an anilinopyrimidine derivative. Fedratinib was granted FDA approval on August 16, 2019.Fedratinib is a kinase inhibitor that inhibits cell division and induces apoptosis. Patients taking fedratinib may experience anemia, thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal toxicity, hepatic toxicity, or elevated amylase and lipase. These effects should be managed by reducing the dose, temporarily stopping the medication, or providing transfusions on a case by case basis.Fedratinib is an inhibitor of Janus Activated Kinase 2 (JAK2) and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3."
2076,DB12513,"In patients with Friedreich's ataxia, a genetic disease involving mitochondrial dysfunction, the Nrf2 pathway is impaired, and Nrf2 activity is lower. The use of omaveloxolone for the treatment of conditions involving mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress has also been evaluated.The MOXIe study showed that after 4 weeks of administration, the use of omaveloxolone led to robust doseâdependent changes at 80 â300 mg/day.. It can also cause changes in cholesterol.The mechanism of action of omaveloxolone has not been fully elucidated; however, its therapeutic effect in patients with Friedreich's ataxia may be linked to its ability to activate the Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) pathway. Nrf2 is a transcription factor that mitigates oxidative stress. In normal conditions, Nrf2 levels are regulated by Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), which binds to Nrf2, prevents Nrf2 translocation to the nucleus, and degrades it by ubiquitination."
2077,DB12530,"Inebilizumab is indicated for the treatment of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) immunoglobulin-positive (AQP4-IgG) neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) in adult patients.Inappropriate growth of or self-directed antibody production by B-cells is the etiological underpinning of a variety of conditions, including the multiple sclerosis-like neurological condition neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). Inebilizumab was granted FDA approval on June 11, 2020, for the treatment of anti-aquaporin 4 positive NMOSD patients. Given its mechanism of action and good safety profile, it may prove useful in the treatment of other conditions linked to autoimmune antibody production or B-cell malignancies. On January 16, 2024, Iinebilizumab also received Health Canada approval for the same indication.Inebilizumab is a CD19-directed monoclonal antibody that results in immunosuppression through B-cell depletion with sufficient efficacy to allow a six-month dosing schedule. Animal data suggests the possibility of fetal harm with inebilizumab and therefore, effective contraception during and for six months following inebilizumab treatment is recommended.Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), formerly referred to as Devic's disease, is an antibody-mediated autoimmune condition resulting in astroglial cell death, demyelination, and central nervous system (CNS) inflammation."
2078,DB12532,"Oxetacaine is part of the anesthetic antacids which increase the gastric pH while providing relief from pain for a longer period of duration at a lower dosage. This property has been reported to relieve the symptoms of hyperacidity. Oxetacaine is reported to produce a reversible loss of sensation and to provide a prompt and prolonged relief of pain. Its anesthetic action produces the loss of sensation which can be explained by its inhibitory activity against the nerve impulses and de decrease in permeability of the cell membrane.Oxetacaine inhibits gastric acid secretion by suppressing gastrin secretion. This potent local anesthetic effect of oxetacaine may be explained by its unique chemical characteristics in which, as a weak base, it is relatively non-ionized in acidic solutions whereas its hydrochloride salt is soluble in organic solvents and it can penetrate cell membranes."
2079,DB12543,"Samidorphan has been shown in animal models and clinical trials to ameliorate -induced weight gain and metabolic dysfunction. Similarly, samidorphan use may lead to life-threatening opioid overdose, either in patients who attempt to overcome the samidorphan-induced opioid blockade or resume opioid use when therapy is interrupted or discontinued. Patients may be at increased risk of cognitive and motor impairment; caution while operating machinery is recommended.Samidorphan is a novel  analogue containing a 3-carboxamido group that functions as an opioid receptor modulator, both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, both the major N-dealkylated and the major N-oxide human metabolites bind to the Î¼-, Îº-, and Î´-opioid receptors (Ki values of 0.26, 23, and 56, and 8, 110, and 280 nM, respectively); the former functions as a Î¼-opioid receptor agonist and the latter as an antagonist. Clinical studies have demonstrated that the addition of samidorphan to  helps mitigate its metabolic-related adverse effects; presumably, this is due to opioid receptor signalling, though the exact mechanism remains to be determined."
2080,DB12548,"Sparsentan is indicated to reduce proteinuria in adults with primary immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) at risk of rapid disease progression, generally a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) â¥1.5 g/g.Sparsentan is a dual antagonist of the endothelin type A receptor (ETAR) and the angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 receptor (AT1R) with a similar affinity for both (9.3 nM for ETAR and 0.8 nM for AT1R). Furthermore, it is the first non-immunosuppressive therapy for the reduction of proteinuria in IgAN. The use of sparsentan may cause hepatotoxicity, embryo-fetal toxicity, hypotension, acute kidney injury, hyperkalemia, and fluid retention.Sparsentan is a molecule that acts as a dual antagonist of the endothelin type A receptor (ETAR) and the angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 receptor (AT1R). ET-1 and Ang II contribute to the pathogenesis of immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN), a condition characterized by the increased production of galactose-deficient IgA1 (Gd-IgA1) antibodies. By acting as both an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and an endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA), sparsentan reduces proteinuria in patients with IgAN."
2081,DB12597,"It is also indicated in the treatment of Ph+ CML in adult patients with the T315I mutation.Asciminib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) used in the treatment of chronic-phase Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (Ph+ CML). More specifically, it is an inhibitor of the ABL1 kinase activity of the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein which serves as a driver of CML proliferation in most patients with the disease. It has also shown benefit in Ph+ CML with the T315I mutation, which produces a mutant BCR-ABL1 which is typically treatment-resistant as compared to wild-type BCR-ABL1. Asciminib is unique in that it acts as an allosteric inhibitor, binding at the myristoyl pocket of the BCR-ABL1 protein and locking it into an inactive conformation. Patients may also experience pancreatic and/or cardiovascular toxicity, both of which require frequent monitoring and may require dose adjustments as per prescribing information.In most patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), progression of the disease is driven primarily by a translocation of the Philadelphia chromosome that creates an oncogenic fusion gene, BCR-ABL1, between the BCR and ABL1 genes."

2084,DB12674,"Lurbinectedin is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy.Lurbinectedin is a DNA alkylating agent that has been investigated in the treatment of a variety of cancers, including mesothelioma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), breast cancer, and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). This accelerated approval is based on the rate and duration of therapeutic response observed in ongoing clinical trials and is contingent on the verification of these results in confirmatory trials.Lurbinectedin exerts its chemotherapeutic activity by covalently binding to DNA, resulting in double-strand DNA breaks and subsequent cell death. Lurbinectedin has been associated with myelosuppression, and patients receiving therapy with this agent should be closely monitored for evidence of cytopenias. Prior to beginning therapy, ensure baseline neutrophil counts are >1,500 cells/mm3 and platelet counts are >100,000/mm3. It covalently binds to guanine residues in the DNA minor groove, forming adducts that bend the DNA helix towards the major groove."
2085,DB12688,"HCL is an uncommon type of lymphocytic leukemia that starts in B cells or B lymphocytes. In an open-label clinical trial, MxP showed a complete response, defined as the maintenance of hematologic remission, of more than 180 days in 30% of the patients and 75% of the patients achieved at least partial response. CD22 is a B-lymphocyte restricted transmembrane protein with a high density in HCL cells when compared with normal B cells. This toxin inhibits protein translation which induces an apoptotic state of the high CD22-expressed cancer cell. The toxin included in MxP is the _Pseudomonas_ exotoxin A which, after internalization, undergoes conformational changes and in the cytosol, the ribosylation activity of the domain III of the toxin inactivates the eukaryotic translation elongation factor (eEF-2) by transferring ADP (adenosine di-phosphate-ribose) from NAD to a modified histidine at position 715 in eEF-2."
2086,DB12698,"Trogarzo inhibits viral entry into cells, effectively managing HIV-1 infection in those who have attempted other therapies to no avail .Ibalizumab is a monoclonal antibody and viral-entry inhibitor that coats CD4-positive cells, the main target of HIV infection. By blocking viral entry into CD4 cells, ibalizumab creates a barrier for HIV, which is a different mechanism from those of entry inhibitors that target viral proteins or chemokine co-receptors. This epitope is located on the surface of CD4 opposite to the site in domain 1 that is essential for CD4 binding of the MHC class II molecules. CD4 is an integral cell surface glycoprotein that is able to enhance T cell-specific antigen responses when it interacts with its physiological ligand, class II major histocompatibility (MHC) molecules. The entry of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) into cells requires the sequential binding of the viral exterior envelope glycoprotein, gp120, with the CD4 glycoprotein and a chemokine receptor on the cell surface."
2087,DB12713,"In the US, sotagliflozin is indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and heart failure in adults with heart failure, type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and other cardiovascular risk factors.Sotagliflozin is a dual inhibitor of SGLT1 and SGLT2, the first of its kind, which is approved for use in the EU, in combination with insulin, to improve glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and a BMI â¥27 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. A similar approval has also been sought in the US, but the FDA has since published a proposal to refuse the approval because the data submitted did not show that it was safe under the proposed conditions of use. In May 2023, sotagliflozin was approved by the FDA to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and heart failure in patients with high risk factors.Sotagliflozin exerts its pharmacologic effects by slowing glucose absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and increasing the excretion of glucose in the urine. The use of SGLT2 inhibitors, including sotagliflozin, can cause diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Inhibition of SGLT1 results in a delay in glucose absorption and a blunting of postprandial hyperglycemia, while inhibition of SGLT2 reduces renal reabsorption of filtered glucose, thereby increasing urinary glucose excretion."
2088,DB12783,"The primary therapeutic use for which benserazide is currently indicated for is as a combination therapy with levadopa for the treatment of Parkinson's disease in adults > 25 years of age, with the exception of drug-induced parkinsonism . Although studies are ongoing, no evidence has been formally elucidated as of yet .When levodopa is used by itself as a therapy for treating Parkinson's disease, its ubiquitous metabolism into dopamine is responsible for a resultant increase in the levels of circulating dopamine in the blood and to various extracerebral tissues. Unfortunately, the resultant increase in the levels of circulating dopamine in the blood and to various extracerebral tissues can result in a number of side effects like nausea, vomiting, or even cardiac arrhythmias that may diminish patient adherence . A decarboxylase inhibitor like benserazide is consequently an effective compound to combine with levadopa as it is incapable of crossing the blood-brain barrier itself and therefore allows levadopa to elicit its primary action in the central nervous system, but will prevent the formation of dopamine from levadopa in extracerebral tissues - thereby acting to minimize the occurrence of extracerebral side effects .The combination of levodopa and benserazide is an anti-Parkinsonian agent . It is important to note, however, that benserazide is hydroxylated to trihydroxybenzylhydrazine in the intestinal mucosa and the liver , and that as a potent inhibitor of the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase , it is this trihydroxybenzylhydrazine metabolite of benserazide that mainly protects levodopa against decarboxylation to dopamine in the gut and also around the rest of the body outside of the blood-brain barrier .Finally, it is also proposed that benserazide hydrochloride may be able to treat beta thalassaemia by maintaining the active expression of the gene for fetal hemoglobin so that constant production of fetal hemoglobin may replace the missing adult hemoglobin variation that is characteristic of patients with the condition, thereby decreasing the need for blood transfusion therapy ."
2089,DB12825,"Lefamulin is indicated to treat adults diagnosed with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) that is caused by susceptible bacteria. The list of susceptible bacteria includes Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible), Legionella pneumophila, Haemophilus influenza, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.Lefamulin is a pleuromutilin antibiotic used for the treatment of bacterial community-acquired pneumonia. It inhibits protein translation through binding to both the A and P sites of the PTC via four hydrogen bonds, resulting in the interruption of peptide bond formation. Lefamulin exerts a selective inhibition of protein translation in eukaryotes, however, does not affect ribosomal translation of eukaryotes. Because of its mechanism of action that differs from that of other antimicrobials, cross-resistance to other antibiotic classes is less likely."
2090,DB12839,"Pegvaliase is indicated for the management of phenylketonuria (PKU) in adult patients who have uncontrolled blood phenylalanine concentrations greater than 600 micromol/L on existing management.Pegvaliase is a recombinant phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) enzyme derived from Anabaena variabilis that converts phenylalanine to ammonia and trans-cinnamic acid . PAH deficiency and inability to break down an amino acid phenylalanine (Phe) leads to elevated blood phenylalanine concentrations and accumulation of neurotoxic Phe in the brain, causing chronic intellectual, neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disabilities if untreated . Individuals with PKU also need to be under a strictly restricted diet as Phe is present in foods and products with high-intensity sweeteners . The presence of a PEG moiety in pegvaliase-pqpz allows a reduced immune response and improved pharmacodynamic stability .In a phase 3 clinical trial of adult patients with phenylketonuria and blood phenylalanine concentrations greater than 600 Âµmol/L on existing management therapies, subcutaneous administration of pegvaliase resulted in significantly reduced blood phenylalanine concentrations in most patients compared to their pre-treatment baseline levels within 24 months in addition to improved neuropsychiatric symptoms .

2091,DB12874,"Additionally, quizartinib also demonstrates inhibitory activity toward FLT3 with internal tandem duplication (ITD), although with a 10-fold lower affinity compared to wild-type FLT3. Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated quizartinib's efficacy in relapsed/refractory FLT3-ITD mutant AML. In AML patients receiving quizartinib at a dose of 90 mg/day for females and 135 mg/day for males on a 28-day schedule, the median levels of phospho-FLT3 (pFLT3) and total FLT3 (tFLT3) decreased from 3312 RLU or 5639 RLU respectively at day 1 to 1235 RLU and 142 RLU respectively at day 8. Quizartinib is a small molecule inhibitor of the receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3. Quizartinib and its major active metabolite AC886 bind to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding domain of FLT3 with comparable affinity, and both had 10-fold lower affinity towards FLT3-ITD mutation compared to FLT3 in a binding assay."

Within the body, FXIII circulates as a heterotetramer composed of 2 A-subunits and 2 B-subunits (A2B2). When activated by thrombin at the site of injury, the FXIII pro-enzyme is cleaved resulting in activation of the catalytic A-subunit and dissociation from its carrier B-subunit. Other drug products with similar structure and function to Factor XIII (human) include , which is a recombinant form of the A subunit of human coagulation factor XIII. Exogenous replacement of Factor XIII is a cornerstone of treatment for bleeding associated with congenital Factor XIII deficiency."
2095,DB12911,"Nevertheless, most of the available studies regarding the use of nicoboxil and nonivamide topical analgesics focus specifically on their efficacy and safety in treating acute non-specific low back pain, typically finding the combination analgesic to be an effective, safe, and well-tolerated medication for such an indication .Nicoboxil has been investigated for the treatment of Acute Low Back Pain, where it is typically considered an effective and safe therapeutic option.Despite topical nicoboxil/nonivamide topical analgesic medication being used since the 1950s, recent studies demonstrate continued interest in the medication(s) given its demonstrated efficacy, safety, and capability to be used as an alternative musculoskeletal pain therapy option with less systemic side effects when compared to the oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids that may be more typically prescribed .Topical applications consisting of the individual active ingredients of nicoboxil and nonivamide at doses considered to be therapeutic are generally not considered readily available commercially . Subsequently, the pharmacodynamics of nicoboxil are considered useful in commercially available combination products largely because they combine with those of nonivamide to offer a synergistic effect from the unique complementary actions of these two agents . Subsequently, nonivamide is a synthetic capsaicin analog with analgesic properties which are assumed to result from the depletion of Substance P in the peripheral nociceptive C-fibres and A-delta nerve fibers upon repetitive topical application . Resultant stimulation of afferent nerve endings in the skin evidently causes a dilatory effect on the surrounding blood vessels accompanied by an intense, long-lasting sensation of warmth associated with the nonivamide use . Nevertheless, it is generally proposed that rubefacients cause irritation of the skin when applied topically, and are believed to alleviate pain in muscles, joints, tendons, and other musculoskeletal pains in the extremities by counter-irritation ."

2131,DB13257,"Ferrous sulfate is used for the prevention and treatment of iron deficiency anemia in adults and children. A deficiency in iron indicates that the body cannot produce enough normal red blood cells. Iron deficiency anemia occurs when body stores of iron decrease to very low levels, and the stored iron is insufficient to support normal red blood cell (RBC) production. It can then can be incorporated into ferritin and be stored in the macrophage or carried of the macrophage by ferroportin. This exported iron is  oxidized by the enzyme to ceruloplasmin to Fe3+, followed by sequestration by transferrin for transport in the serum to various sites, including the bone marrow for hemoglobin synthesis or into the liver."
2132,DB13268,"Acetarsol has been used for the treatment of different diseases such as syphilis, amoebiasis, yaws, trypanosomiasis, and malaria. Acetarsol was used commonly for the treatment of vaginitis due to _Trichomonas vaginalis_ and _Candida albicans_. When orally administered, acetarsol can be used for the treatment of intestinal amoebiasis and in the form of suppositories it has been researched for the treatment of proctitis. It was first discovered in 1921 by Ernest Fourneau at the Pasteur Institute. It has been canceled and withdrawn from the market since August 12, 1997.Some reports indicate a certain infection remission with the use of acetarsol but this reports also demonstrate the absorption of systemic arsenic which can be physiologically dangerous.The mechanism of action of acetarsol is not well known but it is thought to bind to protein-containing sulfhydryl groups located in the infective microorganism and to form a lethal As-S bond."
2133,DB13269,"Dichlorobenzyl alcohol is considered as an active ingredient found in several marketed OTC products by Health Canada which has categorized this agent as an anatomical therapeutic chemical. On the other hand, dichlorobenzyl alcohol is categorized by the FDA in the inactive ingredient for approved drug products.In vitro studies dichlorobenzyl alcohol a have shown a virucidal against a number of viruses associated with the common cold which is observed by a reduction in the viral load. In clinical trials, administration of dichlorobenzyl alcohol lozenges has been shown to generate a reduced throat soreness and to provide pain relief and relief from difficulty in swallowing 5 minutes after administration. This effect can last for even 2 hours. The local anesthetic action of dichlorobenzyl alcohol is thought to be due to a reduced sodium channel blockade."
2134,DB13293,"Ipecac is indicated as an emetic agent for the induction of vomiting in poisoning victims who ingested systemic poison in order to prevent absorption of the chemicals through the gastrointestinal tract. In low doses, ipecac was also used as an expectorant. Ipecac was approved by Health Canada as an OTC but all those products are now discontinued. In prospective studies with children, the mean time to vomit was reported to be of 21.7 minutes.The emetic components of ipecac, emetine and cephaeline, act centrally and locally in the gastrointestinal tract to cause vomiting. The mechanism by which ipecac performs his effect is by irritating the stomach lining and chemically stimulating the chemoreceptor trigger zone."

2136,DB13346,"Indicated for the treatment of various skin conditions, such as atopic eczema and other inflammatory dermatoses. Bufexamac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) under the market name Droxaryl, Malipuran, Paraderm and Parfenac. The use of bufexamac has been discontinued in Canada and the United States, which may be due to undetermined clinical efficacy and a high prevalence of contact sensitization . Bufexamac was also withdrawn by the EMA in April 2010.Bufexamac is a topically-active anti-inflammatory agent that inhibits the cyclooxygenase enzyme. In cutaneous and deep experimental inflammation, topical administration of bufexamac exerted a dose-related anti-inflammatory effect ."
2137,DB13501,"Bendazac, however, has since been withdrawn or discontinued in various international regions due to its capability or risk for eliciting hepatotoxicity  in patients although a small handful of regions may continue to have the medication available for purchase and use either as a topical anti-inflammatory/analgesic cream or eye drop formulation.Bendazac principally demonstrates an antidenaturant action on proteins . This effect has been shown to inhibit the denaturation of various proteins like ocular lens proteins by heat, ultraviolet radiation, free radicals, and other chemicals . Some preliminary studies have suggested that an apparent improvement of the blood-retinal barrier had been observed in diabetic patients using bendazac lysine 500 mg three times a day for three to six months . Moreover, the use of topical bendazac has also been shown to demonstrate anti-inflammatory effects in animal models and clinical studies to effectively treat varied dermatoses, especially those involving a necrotic component . In particular, the denaturation of lens proteins may in part be prevented by inhibiting the binding of certain chemicals like cyanates or sugars and 5-hydroxybendazac - the major metabolite of bendazac - has been shown to be capable of inhibiting the glycosylation of lens proteins by sugars like galactose or glucose-6-phosphate in a dose-dependent manner ."
2138,DB13503,"The tyrocidine dimer is able to disrupt the cell membrane producing leakage of cell contents but the exact mechanism of this permeabilization is unclear. The alternating L and D amino acid structure allows the hydrophobic side chains to point outwards into the lipid bilayer, leaving the more hydrophilic backbone to form the lumen of the pore. The carbonyl oxygen atoms aid in the transport of cations through the pore. In both double helix and helical dimer conformations, gramcidins are capable of transporting monovalent cations through the membrane. Loss of potassium ions through membrane permeabilization seems to inhibit bacterial growth."
2139,DB13583,Mephenesin was used for the treatment of muscle spasticity in diseases like Parkinson's or Multiple Sclerosis.Mephenesin is a synthetic cresol glyceryl ether which produces transient muscle relaxation and paralysis via central nervous system depression . It first entered use in the 1950s.Mephenesin reduced neuronal excitability leading to decreases action potentials to muscle fibers which ultimately produces a reduction in spasticity .The exact mechanism of action of mephenesin is not known. It has been observed to block both inward sodium and inward calcium currents in neurons . It has a physiological effect which opposes that of strychnine.
2140,DB13595,"It is subsequently also used for the symptomatic treatment of diseases where it is necessary to neutralize acid in the stomach, for example, for treating stomach and duodenal ulcers or heartburn and stomach conditions caused by excess stomach acid .Almasilate is a buffering antacid that has been used in peptic ulcers and dyspepsia. It is a crystalline polyhydrate of aluminium/magnesium silicate and mediates its buffering activity by binding hydrogen ions within the polymer. Given that there are generally more widely available conventional antacids that are just as - if not more - effective than almasilate, almasilate products are only available in certain parts of Europe and/or Asia.Various non-prescription antacid products are available to the general public to purchase and use as a treatment for relieving the occasional, limited, and non-severe sensation of heartburn (or acid indigestion) that may frequently be associated with stomach indigestion (or dyspepsia) or gastroesophageal reflux disease (when stomach contents may rise back up into the esophagus and cause a taste of acid in the back of the mouth, among other symptoms) . Specifically, the aluminosilicate minerals dissolve, and in doing so consume acidic hydrogen ions and release moieties like H4SiO4, Al3+, and other cations, including the magnesium associated with the compound . Almasilate consequently contributes to the overall acid-neutralization by consuming acid hydrogen ion in this way ."
2141,DB13615,"Indicated in children, adolescents and young adults for the treatment of high-grade, resectable, non-metastatic osteosarcoma after macroscopically complete surgical resection, typically in combination with post-operative multi-agent chemotherapy .Mifamurtide is an immunomodulator with antitumor activity via activation of macrophages and monocytes. It is administered as an adjuvant therapy to postoperative combination chemotherapy in pediatric, adolescent or adult patients with high-grade, resectable, non-metastatic osteosarcoma after macroscopically complete surgical resection. Mifamurtide is referred to as MTP-PE or L-MTP-PE (in case of the liposomal formulation), which is a fully synthetic derivative of muramyl dipeptide (MDP), which is a motif within the peptidoglycan polymer in the cell wall of bacteria. Activation of intracellular signaling transduction pathway NF-ÎºB can promote inflammation and release of antimicrobial peptides, resulting in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and TNF-Î±, and other molecules such as chemokines and adhesion molecules . Upon intravenous administration, lipophilic mifamurtide is selectively phagocytosed by monocytes and macrophages followed by subsequent degradation of liposomal vesicles by the phagocytic cells."
2142,DB13620,"Potassium gluconate is believed to be more palatable and non-acidifying than potassium chloride (KCl) .Potassium is an essential nutrient. It is the most abundant cation in intracellular fluid, where it plays a key role in maintaining cell function, especially in excitable cells such as skeletal muscles, the heart,  and nerves . In the extracellular fluid, sodium predominates and the potassium content is low (3.5 to 5 mEq per liter). The intracellular to extracellular potassium gradients are necessary for nerve impulse signaling in such specialized tissues as the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle, and for the maintenance of physiologic renal function and maintenance of acid-base balance. Intracellular K+ serves as a reservoir to limit the fall in extracellular potassium concentrations occurring under pathologic conditions with loss of potassium from the body ."

It binds muscarinic acetycholine receptors and thereby decreases secretory excretion of stomach acids as well as saliva and sweat.Diphemanil Methylsulfate exerts its action by primarily binding the muscarinic M3 receptor. M3 receptors are located in the smooth muscles of the blood vessels, as well as in the lungs. This means they cause vasodilation and bronchoconstriction. They are also in the smooth muscles of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), which help in increasing intestinal motility and dilating sphincters."
2145,DB13746,"A mixture containing only S-forms of allethrin is referred to as esbioallethrin or S-bioallethrin. It is claimed to have low mammalian toxicity.Bioallethrin causes respiratory paralysis in lice and scabies parasites resulting in death .Bioallethrin, like other pyrethroids, binds to voltage gated sodium channels in their closed state and modifies the gating kinetics . Once bound pyrethroids slow both the opening and closing of the sodium channel resulting in a need for stronger excitatory potentials to produce an action potential and a delay in repolarization. In contrast bioallethrin has been found to block L T, and P/Q-types of voltage gated calcium channels in human embryonic kidney cell cultures . Bioallethrin has been found to inhibit both sodium-calcium dependent and magnesium-calcium ATP hydrolysis in insects although it, along with other type I pyrethroids, has a greater effect on sodium-calcium dependent hydrolysis ."

2147,DB13749,"Magnesium gluconate is a mineral supplement which is used to prevent and treat low levels of magnesium. In addition, it has been studied for its effects on premature uterine contractions .Magnesium is a cofactor in over 300 enzyme systems that regulate a variety of biochemical reactions in the body, including protein synthesis, muscle and nerve function, blood glucose control, and blood pressure regulation. By competing with calcium for membrane binding sites and by stimulating calcium sequestration by sarcoplasmic reticulum, magnesium helps in the maintenance of a low resting intracellular free calcium ion concentration, which is essential in various cellular functions. Magnesium is essential to many enzymatic reactions in the body, serving as a cofactor in protein synthesis and in carbohydrate metabolism . Magnesium also plays an important role in the active transport of calcium and potassium ions across cell membranes, a process which is important to nerve impulse conduction, muscle contraction, and normal heart rhythm ."
2148,DB13751,"As a therapeutic agent, is has been used in a vast variety of formulations as it is reported to be anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcer, anti-allergic, antioxidant, anti-tumor, anti-diabetic and hepatoprotective. It is also known to be used as a remedy for peptic ulcer and other stomach diseases.Glycyrrhizic acid is extracted from the root of the licorice plant; _Glycyrrhiza glabra_. From January 2014, glycyrrhizic acid as part of the licorice extract was approved by the FDA as an existing food sweetener. The alpha form is predominant in the liver and duodenum and thus, it is thought that the anti-inflammatory liver effect of this drug are mainly due to the action of this isomer. The antiviral activity of glycyrrhizic acid includes the inhibition of viral replication and immune regulation."
2149,DB13783,"Acemetacin is not FDA, Canada or EMA approved, but in the countries where it is marketed it is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of pain and swelling in acute inflammation of the joints in rheumathoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, low back pain and post-surgical pain. It is also indicated for the treatment of chronic inflammation of the joints in presence of rheumatoid arthritis, treatment of ankylosing spondylitis, treatment of irritation in the joints and spinal column caused by degenerative disorders, treatment of inflammatory soft-tissue rheumatism syndrome and painful swelling and inflammation caused by injury.Acemetacin is a carboxymethyl ester of indometacin. It is a potent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, derived from the indol-3-acetic acid, whose activity is thought to be mainly through its active metabolite indomethacin. It was developed by E. Merck and Company in Germany as an attempt to provide a safer drug but other than the amelioration on the gastrointestinal effects, the metabolism of acetamicin led to the formation of indomethacin and it kept the same side effects.The effect of acemetacin causes a weak reduction of prostaglandin synthesis which generates an anti-inflammatory and analgesic effect. COX is essential for the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 and F2 which are molecules derived from fatty acids and stored in the cell membrane."
2150,DB13800,"Calcium levulinate can be used alone, or with calcium lactate, calcium chloride, and other compounds, either for pharmaceutical tablets, capsules, or injections preparation .The relatively new calcium levulinate is produced from a direct reaction between L- or levulinic acid levulose and calcium hydroxide . Finally, this calcium levulinate formulation is also believed to have good compatibility with calcium lactate, calcium chloride, and other material complexes which allows the formulation to also complex effectively with a diverse variety of foodstuffs and pharmaceutical dosage forms .Much like most calcium supplements, once calcium levulinate dissociates in the body after administration, absorption of the supplemental calcium ions across the intestinal wall serves to enhance calcium stores in the body . Moreover, the carbon-oxygen double bond from LA's carbonyl group possesses a strong polarity, where the oxygen atom has a stronger electron attracting ability compared to the carbon atom, such that the pi electron will ultimately transfer into the greater electronegative oxygen, therefore resulting in the formation of a positive charge center in the carbon atom . Furthermore, LA can be isomerized into the enol-isomer, owing to the presence of the carbonyl group . The chemical structure of LA consequently has several highly active sites, which facilitates it being used as a chemical platform for preparing many other chemical products ."

It works to decrease elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein B, while increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Due to its high hydrophilicity and poor absorption profile, prodrug ,, and other conjugated compounds of fenofibric acid, such as choline fenofibrate, have been developed for improved solubility, gastrointestinal absorption, and bioavailability, and more convenient administration.Various clinical studies have shown that elevated levels of total cholesterol, low-desnsity-lipoprotein (LDL-C), and apolipoprotein B (apo B) - an LDL membrane complex - are associated with human atherosclerosis . Moreover, such treatment with fenofibrate also results in increases in HDL-C and apo AI and apo AII . The size of these larger low-density-lipoprotein particles have a greater affinity for cholesterol receptors and are therefore catabolized more rapidly ."

The standard treatment is done with the administration of recombinant or serum-deriver Factor VIII which induces the formation of anti-factor VIII alloantibodies (Factor VIII inhibitors) and renders the standard treatment ineffective.Emicizumab is a humanized recombinant monoclonal antibody that mimics the function of the coagulation Factor VIII and it has the capacity to bind simultaneously to activated Factor IX and Factor X. It was created by Chugai Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd. and co-developed with Roche and Genentech.Emicizumab mimics the function of coagulation factor VIII, therefore it binds to the activated form of Factor IX (Factor IXa). The ability of Emicizumab to interact with both factors (Factor IXa and Factor X) activates the coagulation cascade that will subsequently lead to the segmentation of fibrinogen into fibrin and the formation of blood clots. It presents a dual specificity which allows it to bind to both the Factor IXa and Factor X, performing the required bridging activity for the launch of the coagulation cascade."

2168,DB13925,"The neuroendocrine tumors are bening or malignant tumors produced in the hormone producing cells of the neuroendocrine system. Ga-68 dotatate has a high affinity for somatostatin-2 receptor and it is rapidly excreted from the nontarget sites which gives it an ideal candidate for imaging neuroendocrine tumors. Dotatate gallium 68 was developed by Advanced Accelerator Applications USA, Inc. and FDA approved in June 1, 2016.The overexpression of somatostatin receptor in tumor tissue has been widely studied and the usage of scintigraphy for the diagnostic of neuroendocrine tumors has been happening since the beggining of the 90s. The basis for the mechanism of dotatate gallium 68 is the binding of a ligand analog that is radiolabeled, in this case thye preferred binding site is the receptors of the subtype 2. Dotatate gallium 68 is a Î²+ emiting radionuclide with an emission yield that can be detected by the positron emission tomography and thus the seletive binding to the overexpressed somatostatin receptor will be detected."

2172,DB13943,"Testosterone cypionate is used in males that present conditions derived from a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone. Its benefit compared to other testosterone derivatives is the slow rate of release after injection and longer half-life. It was developed by the company Pharmacia and Upjohn and FDA approved on July 25, 1979.Administration of ester derivatives of testosterone as testosterone cypionate generates an increase in serum testosterone to levels reaching 400% from the baseline within 24 hours of administration. These androgen levels remain elevated for 3-5 days after initial administration. DHT binds to the same androgen receptor even more strongly than T, so that its androgenic potency is about 2.5 times that of T. The T-receptor or DHT-receptor complex undergoes a structural change that allows it to move into the cell nucleus and bind directly to specific nucleotide sequences of the chromosomal DNA."
2173,DB13944,"Testosterone enanthate in males is indicated as a replacement therapy in conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone. Some of the treated conditions are 1) primary hypogonadism, defined as testicular failure due to cryptorchidism, bilateral torsion, orchitis, vanishing testis syndrome or orchidectomy; 2) hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to an idiopathic gonadotropin or luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone deficiency or due to a pituitary-hypothalamic injury from tumors, trauma or radiation, in this case it is important to accompany the treatment with adrenal cortical and thyroid hormone replacement therapy; 3) to stimulate puberty in patients with delayed puberty not secondary to a pathological disorder. Testosterone enanthate injections that are currently formulated for subcutaneous use are specifically indicated only for primary hypogonadism and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism . As the first subcutaneous autoinjector product designed for testosterone replacement therapy, this innovative formulation removes transfer concerns commonly associated with testosterone gels and potentially reduces the need for in-office/in-clinic injection procedures that may inconvenience patients with frequent visits to the clinic .Administration of ester derivatives of testosterone as testosterone enanthate generates an increase in serum testosterone to levels reaching 400% from the baseline within 24 hours of administration. There are no changes in mood and sexual activity by the presence of testosterone enanthate.The effects of testosterone in humans and other vertebrates occur by way of two main mechanisms: by activation of the androgen receptor (directly or as DHT), and by conversion to estradiol and activation of certain estrogen receptors."
2174,DB13946,"Testosterone undecanoate is indicated for testosterone replacement therapy in adult males for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone. Testosterone is a critical male hormone that is responsible for the normal growth and development of the male sex organs and for the maintenance of secondary sex characteristics. Testosterone replacement therapy aims to restore the levels of testosterone, thereby improving symptoms and signs of testosterone deficiency.Once in circulation, testosterone undecanoate is cleaved to release testosterone, which mediates a range of biological actions. Testosterone is an endogenous male hormone that plays a key role in male sexual differentiation: it is involved in the regulation of hematopoiesis, body composition, and bone metabolism. The use in adolescents can lead to the premature closure of bony epiphyses with termination of growth and precocious puberty.Testosterone is a critical male sex hormone that is responsible for the normal growth and development of the male sex organs and the maintenance of secondary sex characteristics, such as the growth and maturation of male sex organs, the development of male hair distribution, vocal cord thickening, and alterations in body musculature and fat distribution."

Ferric citrate (tetraferric tricitrate decahydrate) is a phosphate binder indicated for the control of serum phosphorus levels in patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis.When Fe3+ is converted to soluble Fe2+, it primarily exists in the circulation in the complex forms bound to protein (hemoprotein) as heme compounds (hemoglobin or myoglobin), heme enzymes, or nonheme compounds (flavin-iron enzymes, transferring, and ferritin) . Iron promotes the synthesis of oxygen transport proteins such as myoglobin and hemoglobin, and the formation of heme enzymes and other iron-containing enzymes involved in electron transfer and redox reactions . Iron is incorporated into various proteins to serve biological functions as a structural component or cofactor. Once ferric or ferrous cation from intestinal enterocytes or reticuloendothelial macrophages is bound to circulating transferrin, iron-transferrin complex binds to the cell-surface transferrin receptor (TfR) 1, resulting in endocytosis and uptake of the metal cargo."

2182,DB13961,"Under FDA approval, fish oil pharmaceuticals are typically products consisting of a combination of the omega-3-fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and are indicated primarily as an adjunct to diet to reduce triglyceride levels in adult patients with severe (>=500 mg/dL) hypertriglyceridemia . In general, dietary or pharmaceutical intake of these acids is primarily the only way to increase their levels in the human body where they are overall an essential element to dietary health as they have demonstrated abilities in minimizing or preventing hypertriglyceridemia when taken as an adjunct to a healthy diet . Additionally, these acids also provide energy for the body and are used to form eicosanoids - signaling molecules that have similar chemical structures to the fish oil fatty acids from which they are derived . Nevertheless, it is proposed that such omega-3-fatty acids may not be the preferred substrates of the enzyme diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase that participates in the generation of triglycerides; that  they might interact with nuclear transcription factors that manage lipogenesis; or that their presence and increase in levels can cause cellular metabolism to subsequently shift toward a decrease in triglyceride synthesis and an increase in fatty acid oxidation . It is believed that these effects of such fish oil acids underlie the actions that fish oil have demonstrated on eliciting stability for vulnerable inflammatory plaques ."

Moroctocog alfa is identical in sequence to endogenously produced Factor VIII, but does not contain the B-domain, which has no known biological function. Congenital loss or deficiency of Factor VIII results in the physiologic impairment of the coagulation clotting cascade, and as a result, leads to easy bruising and bleeding. Use of recombinant DNA-derived clotting factor treatments, such as Moroctocog alfa, has reduced this risk. Moroctocog alfa is approved by Health Canada and by the European Medicines Agency for the control and prevention of hemorrhagic episodes and for routine and surgical prophylaxis in patients with hemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency or classic hemophilia). As factor VIII is the specific clotting factor deficient in patients with hemophilia A, replacement of clotting factor with Moroctocog alfa, also known as BDDrFVIII (B domain deleted recombinant factor VIII), is the cornerstone of the prevention and treatment of bleeding for this disorder."

2200,DB14039,"Erenumab is indicated for the preventative treatment of migraine in adults .Erenumab (AMG-334) (INN; trade name Aimovig) is a human monoclonal antibody designed specifically to bind and antagonize the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor (CGRPR) as a means to prevent migraines. The antibody is produced utlilizing recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary cells . It is composed of 2 heavy chains, each containing 456 amino acids, and 2 light chains of the lambda subclass, each containing 216 amino acids, with an approximate molecular weight of 150 kDa .As a human monoclonal antibody designed to specifically bind with and antagonize the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor, there is the possibility that erenumab could interfere with natural activities of CGRP that may not be immediately or directly associated with migraines. For example, at peripheral synapses, CGRP released from trigeminal terminals results in vasodilation by way of CGRP receptor on smooth muscle cells of meningeal and cerebral blood vessels, making CGRP a potent general arterial vasodilator . Please note that erenumab is indicated for subcutaneous use only, though .Erenumab is a human monoclonal antibody that has been designed to bind specifically to the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor and antagonize the CGRP receptor function ."

2206,DB14185,"D2 receptors have been the most common target for antipsychotic agents used in the treatment of schizophrenia: the positive symptoms are thought to arise from overactivity in the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway activating D2 receptors, whereas  negative symptoms may result from a decreased activity in the mesocortical dopaminergic pathway with D1 receptors predominating . In a randomized, double-blind clinical trial, treatment of aripiprazole lauroxil in adult patients with schizophrenia resulted in improvement of positive and negative symptoms scores at day 85 of treatment . In contrast, aripiprazole is thought to act as a functional agonist in the mesocortical pathway, where reduced dopamine activity is seen in association with negative symptoms and cognitive impairment . Antagonism at 5-HT2A receptors by aripiprazole alleviates the negative symptoms and cognitive impairment of schizophrenia .

It inhibits the actions of interleukin-23 (IL-23), a pro-inflammatory cytokine that activates pathways contributing to the development of inflammatory diseases. In April 2023, the US FDA declined to approve mirikizumab for the treatment of ulcerative colitis on the basis of manufacturing concerns. It was officially approved in the EU in May 2023 and Canada in July 2023, and was eventually approved in the US in October 2023 for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severely active ulcerative colitis.Mirikizumab exerts its therapeutic effect by inhibiting the activity of an inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-23 (IL-23), which is involved in mucosal inflammation. The binding of mirikizumab to its target inhibits the interaction between IL-23 and the IL-23 receptor, thereby normalizing the overproduction of effector cytokines driving the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, including ulcerative colitis."
2279,DB14919,"Rozanolixizumab-noli is indicated for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adult patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) or anti-muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibody positive. Therefore, the presence of AChR-antibodies can interfere with the ACh-mediated downstream signaling, thus reducing the likelihood of end plate potentials reaching the threshold needed to trigger an action potential. Therefore, autoantibodies against MuSK can also affect the signal propagation at the NMJ. In June 2023, Rozanolixizumab-noli was approved by the FDA under Priority Review for the treatment of adult patients with generalized myasthenia gravis who are positive for the anti-acetylcholine receptor (AchR) or anti-muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibody. In patients testing positive for AChR and MuSK autoantibodies who were treated with RYSTIGGO, there was a reduction in total IgG levels relative to baseline."
2280,DB14921,"Mavacamten is indicated for the treatment of adults with symptomatic New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-III obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) to improve functional capacity and symptoms by the FDA, Health Canada, and the EMA.Mavacamten is a myosin inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adults with symptomatic New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-III obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). At Week 30 compared with baseline, the reduction in NT-proBNP after mavacamten treatment was 80% greater than for placebo (proportion of geometric mean ratio between the two groups, 0.20 ). The effect of coadministration of mavacamten with QT-prolonging drugs or in patients with potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval has not been characterized. When ATP is bound to the myosin head, it is hydrolyzed into ADP and organophosphate by myosin ATPase activity, and the energy produced from the reaction is stored in the myosin head. As the organophosphate dissociates from myosin, it shifts myosin into a strong binding state to actin, thus creating a myosin-actin complex otherwise known as ""cross-bridging"".Dissociation of the organophosphate also causes a conformation change in myosin that creates strain in the actin-myosin bridge that can only be released once the actin and myosin filaments slide past each other, thus shortening the sarcomere and create a muscle contraction."
2281,DB14924,"Ritlecitinib is indicated for the treatment of severe alopecia areata in adults and adolescents 12 years and older.Ritlecitinib (PF-06651600) is a highly selective inhibitor of Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) and the tyrosine kinase expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (TEC) kinase family. It has been suggested that the dual activity of ritlecitinib toward JAK3 and the TEC kinase family block cytokine signaling as well as the cytolytic activity of T cells, both implicated in the pathogenesis of alopecia areata.Ritlecitinib is a kinase inhibitor that promotes the decrease of absolute lymphocyte levels, T lymphocytes (CD3) and T lymphocyte subsets (CD4 and CD8) in a dose-dependent manner. In patients treated with 50 mg of ritlecitinib once a day, the decrease in median lymphocyte levels remains consistent up to week 48. In the postmarketing safety study of another JAK inhibitor in patients with rheumatoid arthritis over 50 years of age with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, JAK inhibitors were associated with a higher rate of all-cause mortality, including sudden cardiovascular death, compared to TNF blockers.Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder that causes hair loss mainly in the scalp but also on the face and other areas. The overexpression of ULBP3 promotes the attack of cytotoxic cluster of differentiation 8-positive (CD8+) NK group 2D-positive (NKG2D+) T cells to hair follicles, leading to hair follicle dystrophy."
2282,DB14960,"Somatrogon is indicated for the long-term treatment of pediatric patients who have growth failure due to an inadequate secretion of endogenous growth hormone (growth hormone deficiency).Somatrogon is a long-acting recombinant human growth hormone. In October 2021, Health Canada approved somatrogon under the market name NGENLA as the long-term treatment of pediatric patients who have growth failure due to an inadequate secretion of endogenous growth hormone caused by growth hormone deficiency, marking Canada as the first country to approve this drug. In June 2023, the FDA approved the use of somatrogon also for the treatment of pediatric growth hormone deficiency. Like endogenous growth hormone, somatrogon binds to the GH receptor, which leads to the binding of JAK2 to GH receptor and activation of JAK2. One of the activated signalling pathways is the STAT5b signalling pathway, which is critical for the effect of GH on body height."
2283,DB14962,"It is also indicated as a monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors have an activating HER2 mutation and who require systemic therapy following platinum-based chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy.Trastuzumab deruxtecan is a HER2-directed antibody attached to a topoisomerase inhibitor that is approved for use in certain types of treatment-resistant HER2-positive cancers. It is attached to the antibody by a peptide linker. Normally, drugs in this class (antibody-drug conjugates) present a challenge. The monoclonal antibody accurately targets cancer cells, however exert limited killing action. The peptide linker used to formulate this drug is cleavable, which is unique to other antibody-drug conjugates, allowing for increased efficacy and reduced drug resistance to topoisomerase."
2284,DB14967,"Margetuximab is an anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody indicated, in combination with chemotherapy, for the treatment of metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer in adult patients who have received two or more prior anti-HER2 regimens with at least one prior regimen for metastatic disease.The HER2 oncoprotein, the product of the human ERBB2/mouse neu genes, is a member of the HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases that includes the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Of the various subtypes of breast cancer, HER2-positive breast cancer is characterized by ERBB2 overexpression, a higher grade, a more aggressive phenotype, and a worse prognosis compared to HER2-negative cancer. However, due to its modified Fc region, margetuximab binds with higher affinity to both CD16A variants and exhibits weaker binding to the inhibitory CD32B Fc receptor, resulting in more efficient antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and increased efficacy compared to . works through several mechanisms:  binding induces receptor internalization and c-CBL-mediated HER2 degradation; effector cell binding to the Fc region of  through CD16A results in antibody-mediated cell-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC); finally,  binding dampens HER2 activation, phosphorylation, and subsequent downstream oncogenic signalling. CD16A has both high affinity (with valine at position 158; 158V) and low affinity (158F) variants; patients heterozygous or homozygous for the 158F variant have poorer responses to ."
2285,DB14973,"Abrocitinib is indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy. JAK inhibitors recently attracted more attention as potential treatments for inflammatory disorders, as JAK inhibition is associated with rapid and sustained anti-inflammatory efects. Recovery of platelet count (~40% recovery by 12 weeks) occurred without discontinuation of the treatment.Janus kinases (JAKs) are a family consisting of four receptor-associated kinases - JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2). The STAT dimer translocates to the nucleus to upregulate the gene transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors implicated in atopic dermatitis. In atopic dermatitis, JAK1 is the therapeutic target of focus as it is involved in the signalling of the Î³c family of cytokines involved in immune responses and disease pathophysiology, including IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15."
2286,DB14975,"In Europe, it is indicated for the treatment of hemolytic anemia due to sickle cell disease (SCD) in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older as monotherapy.Voxelotor is a novel hemoglobin S polymerization inhibitor for the treatment of sickle cell disease. This is a genetically inherited condition most prevalent in the Middle East, Africa, and certain parts of India. It was developed by Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc. and is unique from other drugs used to treat sickle cell anemia. The EMA approved the use of voxelotor for the treatment of hemolytic anemia associated with sickle cell disease in February 2022.Voxelotor increases hemoglobin (Hb) oxygen affinity in a dose-dependent manner. Voxelotor may inhibit red blood cell sickling, attenuate red blood cell deformability, and reduce whole blood viscosity.Sickle cell disease is characterized by deoxygenated sickle hemoglobin (HbS) polymerization."
2287,DB14989,"On February 5, 2021, the Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval to umbralisib, a kinase inhibitor for PI3K-delta and casein kinase CK1-epsilon, based on promising results from clinical trials. It was marketed as Ukoniq by TG Therapeutics and has been approved for the treatment of relapsing and refractory marginal cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma in adults. While it initially offered a promising therapy for patients experiencing relapsing or refractory disease, umbralisib was withdrawn from the market due to safety concerns as the drug was associated with a possible increased risk of death outweighing the benefits.Umbralisib acts against against marginal zone lymphoma by interrupting the PI3K pathway; this is an essential pathway for B-cell receptor signaling responsible for the progression of lymphoma. An overall response rate of 55% was recorded during clinical trials and the rate of 1-year progression free survival from marginal zone lymphoma was 71%. The effect of this drug on QT interval has not been fully characterized.The PI3K pathway is a  deregulated in malignancies, leading to the overexpression of  p110 isoforms (p110Î±, p110Î², p110Î´, p110Î³) that induces malignant transformation in cells."
2288,DB14996,"Sutimlimab is indicated to treat hemolysis in adults with cold agglutinin disease (CAD)  and decrease the need for red blood cell transfusion in these patients.Cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is a type of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) in which autoantibodies directed against red blood cell surface antigens cause hemolysis at low (3-4Â°C) temperatures. This cold subtype accounts for approximately 15-25% of all AIHA and is more common in the elderly. Hemolysis in patients with CAD is driven by complement activation, which initiates a cascade that ultimately leads to both intra- and extravascular hemolysis. It received FDA approval in February 2022, under the brand name Enjamyo (sutimlimab-jome), becoming the first approved therapy for patients with CAD. Patients undergoing treatment with sutimlimab are at a higher risk of serious infections, especially those caused by encapsulated bacteria such as _Neisseria meningitides_ or _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, and should be monitored closely throughout therapy for evidence of developing or ongoing infections.Hemolysis associated with cold agglutinin disease is driven by the activation of the complement system."
2289,DB14999,"This drug is indicated to treat relapsing forms of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in adults, which includes clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, as well as active secondary progressive disease.Human interferon beta is a polypeptide used in the management of relapsing forms of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and was initially approved by the FDA in 1992. Multiple Sclerosis is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that is usually progressive and significantly debilitating with a profound impact on the quality of life. Interferon-beta has been used in the past in clinical studies with other coronaviruses due to its demonstrated activity against the virus causing Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). It reduces demyelination, the main component of Multiple Sclerosis pathophysiology, reducing the clinical frequency of MS attacks and slowing disease progression. This decreases antigen presentation as well as the proliferation of inflammatory T-cells, reducing the inflammation associated with MS."
2290,DB15001,"Eflapegrastim is indicated to decrease the incidence of infection, as manifested by febrile neutropenia, in adult patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive anti-cancer drugs associated with a clinically significant incidence of febrile neutropenia.Febrile neutropenia (FN), defined as the co-occurrence of fever (temperature > 38 â¦C) and severe neutropenia (ANC < 500 cells/mm3), is a potential side effect of myelosuppressive chemotherapy in which the patient develops an infection during a period of significant neutropenia. The primary factor associated with FN risk is the chemotherapy regimen being administered - regimens are classified as either high-, intermediate-, or low-risk for FN, and relevant guidelines recommend the use of pharmacologic prophylaxis against FN in patients receiving high-risk regimens and those receiving intermediate-risk regimens who have â¥1 additional risk factor. Granulocyte-colony stimulating factors (G-CSFs) - which include  and  - were first used clinically in the 1990s and are the primary means of prophylaxis against chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, including FN. Eflapegrastim is a form of recombinant human G-CSF comprising a human G-CSF analog coupled to the Fc fragment of human IgG4 via a polyethylene glycol linker. Like endogenous G-CSF, eflapegrastim binds to G-CSF receptors on myeloid progenitor cells and neutrophils - this triggers signaling pathways that result in neutrophil differentiation, proliferation, migration, and survival."
2291,DB15011,"Avacopan is indicated for the adjunctive treatment of adult patients with severe active anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis; GPA/MPA) in combination with standard therapy including glucocorticoids. Likely due to its effect on the complement pathway, avacopan has also been associated with hepatitis B virus reactivation and serious infections, which should be monitored for as appropriate.Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic (auto)antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) is considered a ""pauci-immune"" form of systemic small-vessel vasculitis accompanied by the presence of ANCAs in the serum. Concurrently, the anaphylatoxin C5a is produced through activation of the alternative complement pathway, which also primes neutrophils through binding to the C5a receptor (C5aR; CD88). Circulating ANCAs bind to displayed ANCA antigens on the surface of neutrophils; simultaneously, the Fc region of these ANCAs is recognized by FcÎ³ receptors on other neutrophils, resulting in excessive neutrophil activation. The C5a fragment, generated by C5 cleavage, can bind to both the C5aR and C5a-like receptor (C5L2) on the surface of neutrophils; C5aR binding is associated with AAV while C5L2 binding has a protective effect."
2292,DB15031,"In the US and Europe, daridorexant is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance. Daridorexant works on orexin receptors OX1R and OX2R to block the binding of orexins, which are wake-promoting neuropeptides and endogenous ligands to these receptors. Daridorexant reduces overactive wakefulness: in the investigational trials, daridorexant reportedly improved sleep and daytime functioning in patients with insomnia. Daridorexant was approved by the European Commission on May 3, 2022, as the first dual orexin receptor antagonist approved in the market, and by Health Canada on April 26, 2023.Daridorexant binds to and antagonizes the orexin receptors OX1R and OX2R (Ki = 0.47 and 0.93 nM, respectively) equipotentally. In clinical trials, daridorexant improved sleep onset and sleep maintenance, and patient-reported total sleep time."
2293,DB15035,"Zanubrutinib is indicated for the treatment of: - Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) in adults who have received at least one prior therapy. BTK is an enzyme that plays a role in oncogenic signalling pathways, promoting the survival and proliferation of malignant B cells. Due to this enhanced selectivity towards BTK, zanubrutinib belongs to the second-generation BTK inhibitor drug group that also includes , which was approved by the FDA in 2017. In August 2021, the FDA granted accelerated approval to zanubrutinib for the treatment of adults with WaldenstrÃ¶mâs macroglobulinemia. It works to inhibit the proliferation and survival of malignant B cells to reduce the tumour size in mantle cell lymphoma.Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a non-receptor kinase and a signalling molecule for the B cell receptors expressed on the peripheral B cell surface."
2294,DB15043,"Toripalimab is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic or recurrent locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). It is also indicated as a second-line monotherapy for the treatment of adults with recurrent unresectable or metastatic NPC with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy.The proliferation of some cancers can be attributed, at least in part, to the suppression of host tumor surveillance. It was first approved in China in December 2018 for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma in previously treated patients. The binding of programmed death ligands 1 and 2 (PD-L1 and PD-L2) to the PD-1 receptor on T-cells results in the inhibition of T-cell proliferation and cytokine production - this pathway therefore plays a vital role in immune inhibition and self-tolerance. In some cancers, PD-1 ligands may be overexpressed and result in the inhibition of tumor surveillance."
2295,DB15044,"Tafasitamab is indicated, for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified whom are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT).Tafasitamab is a humanized, CD19-directed cytolytic monoclonal antibody intended for the treatment of B-cell malignancies. It is produced using recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and contains an IgG1/2 hybrid Fc-domain which has been modified with 2 amino acid substitutions to enhance its cytotoxicity relative to non-engineered anti-CD19 antibodies. The CD19 surface protein is highly expressed on the surface of B-cells, where it appears to play a role in enhancing B-cell receptor signaling. Tafasatimab is designed to bind to and block the activity of the CD19 surface antigen, which ultimately results in the lysis of B-cells (both healthy and malignant). Patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) experienced a 97% reduction in peripheral blood B-cell counts following 8 days of treatment, with a 100% reduction reached within 16 weeks of treatment."
2296,DB15066,"Givosiran is indicated for the treatment of adults with acute hepatic porphyria.Givosiran is a small interfering RNA (siRNA) directed towards 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase, a critical enzyme in the heme biosynthesis pathway. It is manufactured by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals and was first approved for use in the United States in November 2019 for the treatment of adults with acute hepatic porphyria, a genetic disorder in which the overproduction of toxic heme intermediates leads to neuro-, nephro-, and gastrotoxicity. Givosiran is the second-ever FDA-approved member of the siRNA drug class (the first being ), a new class of drugs promising an important and exciting step forward in the treatment of genetic disorders.Givosiran decreases the rate at which toxic byproducts of heme synthesis are produced in the livers of patients with acute hepatic porphyria, thus preventing their accumulation and associated neuro-, nephro-, and gastrotoxicity. The overexpression of ALAS1, in combination with downstream enzyme deficiencies, leads to the overproduction and accumulation of toxic heme intermediates which are ultimately responsible for the neurovisceral symptoms characteristic of acute hepatic porphyrias. Cleavage of the ALAS1 mRNA results in its degradation, preventing the synthesis of the ALAS1 enzyme and ultimately leading to reduced circulating levels of neurotoxic heme intermediates."
2297,DB15090,"Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), an innate pleiotropic IL-2-family cytokine, has emerged as a key upstream regulator of chronic inflammation across asthma endotypes. conversely, tezepelumab, which targets the upstream master regulator TSLP, has the potential to be effective across asthma endotypes. Tezepelumab was also approved by the European Commission on September 19, 2022.Tezepelumab is a human monoclonal IgG2Î» antibody blocking thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). Tezepelumab treatment in asthmatic patients improves disease markers, including blood and airway submucosal eosinophils and IgE, FeNO, IL-5, and IL-13 levels. As TSLP is incapable of binding IL-7RÎ± prior to its inclusion in the TSLP:TSLPR dimer, tezepelumab effectively blocks the assembly of the ternary complex and resulting downstream signalling."
2298,DB15091,"Upadacitinib is indicated to treat moderately to severely active Crohnâs disease in adults who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more TNF blockers.Upadacitinib is an oral Janus kinase (JAK)1-selective inhibitor and a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis to slow down disease progression. The FDA approved upadacitinib in August 2019 and it is used for the treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, atopic dermatitis, ulcerative colitis, and ankylosing spondylitis. It is believed that these pro-inflammatory cytokines play a role in many autoimmune inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis. JAK1 is primarily involved in the signalling transduction pathways of IL-6, IFN and the common Î³ -chain cytokines, including IL-2 and IL-15. Upon interaction of cytokines with their cytokine receptors, the JAKs mediate the JAK-STAT signal transduction pathway in response to receptor activation."
2299,DB15093,"Somapacitan is indicated as a replacement for growth hormone in adult patients with growth hormone deficiency.Somapacitan, also known as NNC0195-0092, is a growth hormone analog indicated to treat adults with growth hormone deficiency. This human growth hormone analog differs by the creation of an albumin binding site, and prolonging the effect so that it requires weekly dosing rather than daily. Somapacitan was granted FDA approval on 28 August 2020.Somapacitan stimulates the growth hormone receptor. Somapacitan has a long duration of action as it is given once weekly. IGF-1 causes growth in bones and muscle tissue."
2300,DB15097,"Gefapixant is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of refractory or unexplained chronic cough.It has been estimated that 5-10% of adults globally suffer from chronic cough, which is defined as a cough lasting longer than eight weeks. A subset of these patients remain symptomatic despite thorough investigation and treatment, termed refractory chronic cough (RCC) if they have a cough that does not respond to conventional treatment or unexplained chronic cough (UCC) when no diagnosable cause for the cough can be determined. Gefapixant is a novel antagonist of the P2X3 receptor that works to reduce the cough reflex in patients with chronic cough. It is the first therapy to be approved for the treatment of RCC or UCC in the EU.Gefapixant exerts its therapeutic effects via suppressing the cough reflex initiated by sensory C fibers of the vagus nerve. Gefapixant inhibits the binding of ATP to P2X3 receptors, thereby reducing excessive C fiber activation by extracellular ATP and dampening the subsequent cough reflex."
2301,DB15102,"Pemigatinib is indicated for the treatment of unresectable locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma in previously-treated adult patients with a fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusion or other rearrangement as detected by an FDA-approved test. It works by inhibiting fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), which are receptor tyrosine kinases that activate signalling pathways in tumour cells. In April 2020, pemigatinib was approved by the FDA for the treatment of unresectable locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma in previously treated adult patients with a fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene fusion or other rearrangements as detected by an FDA-approved test. With increasing research on the pathogenesis of cholangiocarcinoma and potential therapeutic targets for anticancer drug treatment, recent studies show that up to 45% of patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma exhibited gene rearrangements resulting in oncogenic fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGFR2) fusion proteins. Pemigatinib inhibits FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3, blocking their signalling pathways and decreasing cell viability in cancer cell lines with activating FGFR amplification and fusions that resulted in constitutive activation of FGFR signalling."
2302,DB15114,"Vamorolone is indicated for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in patients â¥2 years of age in the US and in patients â¥4 years of age in the EU.Vamorolone is a novel and fully synthetic glucocorticoid developed by Santhera Pharmaceuticals. Corticosteroid therapy is the current standard of care for DMD despite relatively high rates of adverse effects. Vamorolone is positioned as having a more tolerable adverse effect profile than other corticosteroids owing to its unique receptor binding profile, thus providing an additional treatment option in patients for whom corticosteroid adverse effects are intolerable or otherwise unacceptable. It is also an antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor. The precise mechanism by which vamorolone exerts its therapeutic effects in patients with DMD is unclear."
2303,DB15119,"Ropeginterferon alfa-2b is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with polycythemia vera.Polycythemia vera (PV) is the most common Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), characterized by increased hematocrit and platelet/leukocyte counts, an increased risk for hemorrhage and thromboembolic events, and a long-term propensity for myelofibrosis and leukemia. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur; ropeginterferon alfa-2b is contraindicated in hypersensitive patients and those with known hypersensitivity to other interferons. Life-threatening or fatal neuropsychiatric reactions may occur, including in patients without prior history; ropeginterferon alfa-2b is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe psychiatric disorders. Interferon alfa-2b has been used for decades in PV despite the lack of formal approval. Interestingly, in vitro studies have revealed that ropeginterferon alfa-2b is specific to some extent for JAK2-mutant EECs, a result that is in line with the reduced allelic burden observed in clinical trials."
2304,DB15133,"Tepotinib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) exon 14 skipping alterations.Tepotinib is a MET tyrosine kinase inhibitor intended to treat a variety of MET-overexpressing solid tumors. MET is a desirable target in the treatment of certain solid tumors as it appears to play a critical role, both directly and indirectly, in the growth and proliferation of tumors in which it is overexpressed and/or mutated. In February 2022, tepotinib was approved for use in Europe.Tepotinib is a highly-selective inhibitor of MET kinase activity, with an average IC50 of approximately 1.7 nmol/L. If no other potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis are identified, therapy with tepotinib should be suspended indefinitely.Mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET) is a receptor tyrosine kinase found overexpressed and/or mutated in a variety of tumor types, thus making it a desirable target in their treatment. Tepotinib has also been observed to down-regulate the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) promoting genes (e.g. MMP7, COX-2, WNT1, MUC5B, and c-MYC) and upregulate the expression of EMT-suppressing genes (e.g. MUC5AC, MUC6, GSK3Î², and E-cadherin) in c-MET-amplified gastric cancer cells, suggesting that the tumor-suppressing activity of tepotinib is driven, at least in part, by the negative regulation of c-MET-induced EMT."
2305,DB15149,"Futibatinib is indicated to treat adults with previously treated, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma harbouring fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene fusions or other rearrangements. In Europe, it is indicated in patients whose disease has progressed after at least one prior line of systemic therapy. FGFR was investigated in oncology as a therapeutic target, as FGFR genomic aberrations and dysregulated FGFR signalling pathways are observed in some cancers such as cholangiocarcinoma and urothelial malignancies. As a novel inhibitor of FGFR, futibatinib was first approved by the FDA in September 2022 to treat different types of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Futibatinib ultimately decreases cell viability in cancer cell lines with FGFR alterations, including FGFR fusions or rearrangements, amplifications, and mutations."
2306,DB15171,"Tirzepatide is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus or for the chronic weight management for adult patients that are obese or overweight with at least one weight-related comorbid condition such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, or cardiovascular disease). Tirzepatide is not indicated for use in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.Tirzepatide is a novel dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. Tirzepatide was approved by the FDA on May 13, 2022, under the brand name MOUNJARO by the FDA for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes, making it the first and only GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist for this indication. They have been implicated in the pathophysiology of type II diabetes mellitus as GLP-1R signalling is involved in glucose control by enhancing glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, delaying gastric transit, decreasing plasma glucagon levels, and reducing body weight by activating anorexigenic pathways in the brain. The exact mechanism of action of tirzepatide has not been fully elucidated; however, dual agonism at GIP and GLP-1R may contribute to the glycemic and weight control effects of the drug."
2307,DB15218,"The loss of CD55 can therefore induce complement hyperactivation, causing the unwanted formation of membrane-attacking complex and resulting in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and complement-mediated autoimmune hemolysis that are often observed in CHAPLE disease. In August 18, 2023, pozelimab was approved by the FDA for the treatment of CHAPLE disease. In patients with CD55-deficient PLE receiving a single 30 mg/kg dose administered as an intravenous infusion over approximately one hour followed by a weight-tiered subcutaneous injection once weekly starting at Week 1, CH50 was completely inhibited by Week 1 for most subjects and by Week 12 for all patients. In the same study of patients with CD55-deficient PLE, serum albumin concentrations increased as early as Week 1 and reached the normal range (â¥3.5 g/dL) by Week 4 for most subjects and by Week 12 for all subjects. Endogenous serum IgG concentrations were also increased from baseline at Week 1 in all patients with CD55-deficient PLE and reached a stable concentration around Week 16.Pozelimab-bbfg is a human, monoclonal immunoglobulin G4P (IgG4P) antibody directed against the terminal complement protein C5 that inhibits terminal complement activation by blocking cleavage of C5 into C5a (anaphylatoxin) and C5b, thereby blocking the formation of the membrane-attack complex (C5b-C9, a structure mediating cell lysis)."
2308,DB15226,"Dasiglucagon is an antihypoglycemic agent indicated for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in pediatric and adult patients with diabetes aged 6 years and above.Dasiglucagon is a glucagon analog that acts to increase blood sugar levels. Although it tends to be more common in type 1 diabetes mellitus, occurring in about 22% to 46% of patients annually, about 7% to 25% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with insulin experience severe hypoglycemia a year. In pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes aged seven to 17 years, the mean glucose increase at 60 minutes after administration of dasiglucagon was 162 mg/dL.Dasiglucagon is an analog of glucagon, which is a peptide hormone responsible for increasing blood glucose levels. It has the same mechanism of action as endogenous glucagon by acting as an agonist at glucagon receptors, which are G-coupled receptors expressed throughout the body. Dasiglucagon binds to glucagon receptors in the liver, which activates GsÎ± and Gq, and consequently, adenylate cyclase."

2310,DB15248,"Bulevirtide is indicated for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis D infection in HDV-RNA positive adult patients with compensated liver disease.Hepatitis D is considered the most severe type of viral hepatitis and leads to the rapid development of cirrhosis, severe decompensation of liver function, and an increased risk of mortality. Completion of this clinical trial is anticipated in early 2023.Bulevirtide prevents Hepatitis D entry into cells. It is effective in the reduction of Hepatitis D virus (HDV) RNA levels and improvement of liver inflammation in cases of Hepatitis D infection.The sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP) serves to transport bile acids in the sodium salt form to the liver from the portal circulation. Hepatitis B and D viruses enter hepatocytes through the binding of NTCP (sodium/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide) to the Hepatitis B virus preS1 surface protein domain. Bulevirtide blocks the NTCP binding site, subsequently blocking the entry of the viruses into cells."
2311,DB15258,"Imlifidase is indicated for desensitization of highly sensitized adult kidney transplant patients with a positive crossmatch against an available deceased donor. The treatment is reserved for patients unlikely to receive a transplant under the available kidney allocation system including prioritization programs for highly sensitized patients.Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive and irreversible disease that represents a significant burden for both the individual and healthcare system at large. Highly sensitized individuals carry high levels of anti-HLA antibodies and are at significant risk for antibody-mediated rejection which occurs mainly through complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Imlifidase is a cysteine protease and eliminates Fc-dependent effector functions such as CDC and ADCC by cleaving the heavy chains of human immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. As a result, the risk of antibody-mediated rejection is reduced allowing kidney transplantation in highly sensitized patients to proceed.Imlifidase is highly specific to all four human IgG subclasses and does not cleave any other immunoglobulins (IgM, IgA, IgE, IgD)."
2312,DB15270,"Efgartigimod alfa - delivered intravenously as a monotherapy or subcutaneously is indicated for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis in adult patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive.Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by significant muscle weakness - particularly in the eye, throat, and extremities - caused by autoantibodies attacking the neuromuscular junction. The production of IgG autoantibodies against acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) is one of the more common pathophysiological mechanisms behind MG, and results in the destruction of these receptors and a reduction in electrical nerve impulses. Efgartigimod alfa is a first-in-class antagonist of the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) used in the treatment of MG. IgG antibodies, including the autoantibodies responsible for MG symptoms, can be 'recycled', a process that significantly extends their half-life by evading lysosomal degradation via binding with FcRn. By antagonizing this interaction, efgartigimod alfa prevents this recycling phase and thus decreases the half-life of IgG, effectively lowering circulating levels of IgG autoantibodies against AChRs. A formulation for subcutaneous use that combines efgartigimod alfa and hyaluronidase was approved by the FDA in June 2023.Efgartigimod alfa exerts its pharmacologic effect by reducing circulating levels of the autoantibody responsible for myasthenia gravis symptoms."
2313,DB15283,"Tebentafusp is indicated for the treatment of HLA-A*02:01-positive adult patients with unresectable or metastatic uveal melanoma. ImmTACs bind to target cancer cells that express a specific antigen of interest and recruit cytotoxic T cells to lyse the cells, such as melanocytes. Tebentafusp was subsequently approved for the same indication in the EU in April 2022.Tebentafusp is novel immunotherapy that causes cytotoxicity of cancer cells. HLAs are part of a protein complex that normally regulates immune function: natural T cell responses are initiated by the interaction between the T-cell receptor (TCR) and its peptide antigen, such as gp100, presented by HLA on the surface of a target cell. The TCR arm binds to a gp100 peptide bound to HLA-A on the uveal melanoma tumour cell surface."
2314,DB15305,"Risdiplam is indicated for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).Risdiplam is an orally bioavailable mRNA splicing modifier used for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). This mechanism of action is similar to its predecessor , the biggest difference being their route of administration: nusinersen requires intrathecal administration, as does the one-time gene therapy , whereas risdiplam offers the ease of oral bioavailability. Early trials with risdiplam demonstrated up to a 2-fold increase in SMN protein concentration in SMA patients after 12 weeks of therapy.Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a severe and progressive congenital neuromuscular disease resulting from mutations in the survival of motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene responsible for making SMN proteins. SMN proteins are expressed ubiquitously throughout the body and are thought to hold diverse intracellular roles in DNA repair, cell signaling, endocytosis, and autophagy. Risdiplam is an mRNA splicing modifier for SMN2 that increases the inclusion of exon 7 during splicing, which ultimately increases the amount of functional SMN protein produced by SMN2."
2315,DB15328,"It was approved by the FDA on December 23, 2019, and is the first oral calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist approved for the acute treatment of migraine. Several oral small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists, belonging to a class of medications referred to as ""gepants"", have been investigated for migraines, but only ubrogepant and  remain in clinical development. The development of oral gepants, including ubrogepant, may therefore constitute a significant advance in migraine headache treatment and may become the new standard of therapy in the treatment of this debilitating condition.Ubrogepant acutely treats migraine headache pain by blocking the activity of a key transmitter involved in migraine pathogenesis. Exposure to ubrogepant can be significantly increased in patients with severe hepatic or renal insufficiency - dose adjustments are required for these patients in order to avoid excessive exposure, and ubrogepant is not recommended in patients with end-stage renal disease.The currently accepted theory of migraine pathophysiology considers dysfunction of the central nervous system, in particular the trigeminal ganglion, to be the root cause behind the condition. The trigeminal ganglion appears to amplify and perpetuate the migraine headache pain through the activation of perivascular fibers and the release of molecules involved in pain generation, such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)."
2316,DB15413,"Pafolacianine is an optical imaging agent indicated in adult patients with ovarian cancer as an adjunct for intraoperative identification of malignant lesions.Pafolacianine, or OTL38, is a folate analogue conjugated with a fluorescent dye that absorbs light in the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum  within a range of 760 nm to 785 nm, with a peak absorption of 776 nm. Pafolacianine targets the folate receptor alpha (FRÎ±) which is upregulated in numerous epithelial malignancies. On November 29, 2021, the FDA approved pafolacianine as an adjunct imaging agent for intraoperative identification of malignant lesions in adult patients with ovarian cancer. It is currently under investigation for use in FRÎ±-positive pituitary adenoma, lung cancer, and renal-cell carcinoma, which is thought to be the second-highest folate receptor-expressing cancer.Tumor to background ratios changed with different mass doses studied.

However, patients with certain types of B-cell lymphoma, such as follicular lymphoma (FL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or aggressive B-cell lymphoma, have a high probability of relapse or recurrence after treatment. The response to mosunetuzumab in a high-risk group of patients with progression of follicular lymphoma within 24 months after initiating frontline treatment (n=29) was also beneficial; the ORR was 75.9% and the CR rate was 55.2%. Tumour flare and tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) have also been reported in patients treated with mosunetuzumab.Mosunetuzumab is a full-length, humanized anti-CD20/CD3 bispecific antibody that targets CD20-expressing B-cells. Mosunetuzumab recruits T-cells and leads to their activation by promoting the formation of an immunologic synapse between a target B-cell and a cytotoxic T-cell."

CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitors have been investigated since the mid 1990s for their use in tumorigenesis and chemotherapy. Trilaciclib was granted FDA approval on 12 February 2021.Trilaciclib is indicated to reduce the incidence of chemotherapy induced myelosuppression in patients prior to receiving platinum and etoposide-containing or topotecan-containing chemotherapy regimens for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. Inhibition of CDK2, CDK5, and CDK7 is over 1000-fold less at these concentrations and inhibition of CDK9 is 50-fold less. Inhibition of CDK4 and CDK5 leads to a reversible pause in the cell cycle in the G1 phase for approximately 16 hours."
2319,DB15444,"Elexacaftor is indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients 12 years of age and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the CTFR gene.Elexacaftor (previously VX-445) is a small molecule, next-generation corrector of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. It received FDA approval in October 2019 in combination with  and  as the combination product TrikaftaTM. The triple combination product TrikaftaTM, manufactured by Vertex Pharmaceuticals, is the first product approved for the treatment of CF in individuals who are either homo- or heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR gene - this represents approximately 70-90% of all CF patients.As a CFTR corrector, elexacaftor works to increase the amount of mature CFTR proteins present on the surface of cells. Mutations in the CFTR gene produce CFTR proteins of insufficient quantity and/or function, leading to defective ion transport and a build-up of thick mucous throughout the body that causes multi-organ disease involving the pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and pancreatic systems (amongst others). Elexacaftor is used in combination with tezacaftor, another CFTR corrector with a different mechanism of action, and ivacaftor, a CFTR potentiator that improves the function of CFTR proteins on the cell surface - this multi-faceted, triple-drug approach confers a synergistic effect beyond that seen in typical corrector/potentiator dual therapy regimens."
2320,DB15456,"Vericiguat is indicated in adults with symptomatic, chronic heart failure and an ejection fraction of <45% to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and heart failure-related hospitalization following a hospitalization for heart failure or need for outpatient intravenous diuretics.Vericiguat is a direct stimulator of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) used in the management of systolic heart failure to reduce mortality and hospitalizations. A key component of the NO-sGC-cGMP signaling pathway that helps to regulate the cardiovascular system, sGC enzymes are intracellular enzymes found in vascular smooth muscle cells (amongst other cell types) that catalyze the synthesis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in response to activation by nitric oxide (NO). As a direct stimulator of sGC, vericiguat mitigates the need for a functional NO-sGC-cGMP axis and thereby helps to prevent the myocardial and vascular dysfunction associated with decreased sGC activity in heart failure. Although not the first sGC stimulator to be granted FDA approval ( was approved in 2013 for use in pulmonary hypertension), vericiguat is unique amongst its peers in that modifications to its structure have dramatically decreased its susceptibility to oxidative metabolism, resulting in a relatively long half-life and allowing for once-daily dosing.By directly stimulating the increased production of intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), vericiguat causes the relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and vasodilation. Animal reproduction studies have demonstrated the potential for embryo-fetal toxicity when vericiguat is administered to pregnant females - defects in major vessel and heart formation, as well as spontaneous abortions/resorptions, were observed when vericiguat was administered to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis."
2321,DB15463,"This discovery led to the initial development of belzutifan (at the time called PT2977), which was further developed by a spin-off company named Peloton Pharmaceuticals (which itself was eventually acquired by Merck in 2019). Belzutifan received FDA approval for the treatment of select VHL-associated cancers on August 13, 2021.Belzutifan exerts its therapeutic effects by inhibiting a transcription factor necessary for the growth of solid tumors associated with VHL disease. Both severe anemia and hypoxia have been observed following therapy with belzutifan, and patients should be monitored closely before and during therapy to ensure patients can be managed as clinically indicated. Patients with von-Hippel Lindau (VHL) disease lack functional VHL proteins, leading to an accumulation of HIF-2Î±, and this accumulation is what drives the growth of VHL-associated tumors. Belzutifan is an inhibitor of HIF-2Î± that prevents its complexation with HIF-1Î² in conditions of hypoxia or impaired VHL protein function, thereby reducing the expression of HIF-2Î± target genes and slowing/stopping the growth of VHL-associated tumors."

2324,DB15490,"Zuranolone is indicated for the treatment of postpartum depression (PPD) in adults.Zuranolone is a neuroactive steroid that acts as a positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptors. Unlike other more common GABAA positive allosteric modulators on the market like benzodiazepines, zuranolone can modulate both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA conductance due to binding to a non-benzodiazepine site on the receptor. This approval was based on favorable results from 2 phase 3 clinical trials.At two times the maximum recommended dose, zuranolone does not cause clinically significant QTc interval prolongation. Co-administration of repeated 50 mg daily doses of zuranolone with alcohol or alprazolam led to impairment in psychomotor performance. Therefore, zuranolone can potentiate both phasic and tonic postsynaptic currents associated with modulation of the synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors respectively."

Prednisolone acetate was granted FDA approval in 1955.Corticosteroids bind to the glucocorticoid receptor, inhibiting pro-inflammatory signals, and promoting anti-inflammatory signals. Corticosteroids have a wide therapeutic window as patients make require doses that are multiples of what the body naturally produces. Patients taking corticosteroids should be counselled regarding the risk of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression and increased susceptibility to infections.The short term effects of corticosteroids are decreased vasodilation and permeability of capillaries, as well as decreased leukocyte migration to sites of inflammation. Corticosteroids binding to the glucocorticoid receptor mediates changes in gene expression that lead to multiple downstream effects over hours to days."
2329,DB15568,"Adagrasib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with KRAS G12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have received at least one prior systemic therapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR). Adagrasib targets KRASG12C, one of the most common KRAS mutations, at the cysteine 12 residue and inhibits KRAS-dependent signalling. The use of adagrasib can also lead to severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions, hepatotoxicity and interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis.In normal cells, KRAS is activated by binding to guanosine triphosphate (GTP), and this promotes the activation of the MAP kinase pathway and intracellular signal transduction. Therefore, the use of adagrasib inhibits tumor cell growth and viability in cancers with KRASG12C mutations with minimal off-target activity."

Upon review, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) determined that the vaccine was not associated with a higher overall risk of blood clots, but that it may be associated with very rare instances of blood clots in association with thrombocytopenia - a causal link with the vaccine has not been proven, but is possible and requires further analysis. A phase I/II single-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to investigate the safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of the vaccine began in April 2020 with an expected completion date of October 2021. Following intramuscular administration these spike proteins are expressed locally, allowing the immune system to mount a neutralizing antibody/cellular immune response."
2341,DB15669,"Fezolinetant is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms due to menopause.Vasomotor symptoms (VMS), more colloquially known as hot flashes or night sweats, are some of the most common symptoms in menopause. Although the pathophysiology of VMS is not fully understood, unpredictable fluctuation in estrogen levels is thought to be the main cause of VMS, as estrogen therapy has been one of the most effective treatments for VMS by relieving symptoms in as many as 95% of menopausal women. Estrogen is a potent neuromodulator, particularly in the hypothalamus, and has been shown to be involved as a negative regulator in generating Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulse through the kisspeptin, neurokinin B, and dynorphin (KNDy) neurons. In a phase 2a clinical trial, fezolinetant 90 mg BID significantly reduce the frequency and severity of vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women by more than 50%. The improvement was observed as early as in the first week of treatment and was maintained throughout the 12 weeks of treatment.Fezolinetant is a neurokinin 3 (NK3) receptor antagonist that blocks neurokinin B (NKB) binding on the kisspeptin/neurokinin B/dynorphin (KNDy) neuron to modulate neuronal activity in the thermoregulatory center."
2342,DB15673,"On December 22, 2022, it was also approved by the FDA.Lenacapavir is an antiviral drug with an extended pharmacokinetic profile. In treatment-naive HIV-1-infected patients, a single subcutaneous dose of 20-450 mg resulted in a mean maximum log10-transformed reduction in plasma HIV-1 RNA of 1.35-2.20 by the ninth-day post-injection.HIV-1 co-opts various host factors during its replicative cycle, including during host cell entry, nuclear integration, replication, and virion assembly. Following the initial fusion with the host cell membrane, the viral capsid is released into the host cell cytoplasm. As CPSF6 and Nup153 are essential for nuclear entry, it is likely that lenacapavir binding inhibits these interactions and blocks capsid nuclear entry. Serial passage of HIV-1 in increasing concentrations of lenacapavir resulted in the appearance of major resistance mutations Q67H and N74D, which remain sensitive to other antiretroviral drugs."

2350,DB15762,"In Canada, it is also used in adolescent patients for the same indication.Satralizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody targeted against human interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptors, similar to , which is produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells and based on an IgG2 framework. Some of the pro-inflammatory mechanisms involved in NMOSD are thought to be mediated, at least in part, by IL-6, including increased production of anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) autoantibodies and increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier, which allows for the passage of pro-inflammatory mediators into the CNS. EnspryngÂ®, a satralizumab formulation developed by Chugai Pharmaceutical and Roche, is uniquely formulated with ""recycling antibody technology"" whereby the association of satralizumab to IL-6 receptors occurs in a pH-dependent manner - this allows satralizumab to bind an IL-6 receptor until it reaches an endosome, after which the drug may dissociate from the receptor and move back into the plasma to act again. Satralizumab was first approved for use in Canada in June 2020 for the treatment of AQP4 antibody-positive patients with NMOSD. The inflammatory cascade triggered by IL-6 signaling is thought to result in the differentiation of T-cells into pro-inflammatory TH17 cells and the differentiation of B-cells into plasmablasts producing AQP4 autoantibodies."

2379,DB16385,"Ansuvimab has not been shown to be effective against other species within the Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus genera; factors such as the possible emergence of resistant strains suggest local information on circulating Zaire ebolavirus strains should be consulted before initiating treatment.Infection with pathogenic filoviruses, such as Zaire ebolavirus (Ebola virus, EBOV), can cause severe hemorrhagic fever in humans, resulting in frequent outbreaks with case fatality rates as high as 90%. Ansuvimab, formerly mAb114, is a fully human IgG1 mAb derived from a survivor of the 1995 Kikwit EBOV outbreak 11 years after infection, which displays strong glycan-independent binding to a conserved region of the GP1,2 protein that is responsible for interacting with the host NPC1 protein to mediate EBOV endolysosomal escape, a key step in the EBOV lifecycle. Ansuvimab is just the second FDA-approved treatment for EVD.Ansuvimab is a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed against the Zaire ebolavirus GP1,2 surface glycoprotein that is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. Following internalization into endolysosomes by macropinocytosis, GP1,2 is cleaved by host cathepsins into a fusion-competent form termed GPCL, which subsequently binds the Niemann-Pick C1 protein (NPC1) to induce fusion of the host endolysosomal and viral membranes that releases the viral nucleocapsids into the host cytoplasm. Further in vitro studies revealed that ansuvimab exhibits strong GP binding (EC50 of 0.02 Î¼g/mL), the ability to neutralize GP-expressing lentiviral particles (IC50 of 0.09 Î¼g/mL), and strong antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) at concentrations of 0.03 Î¼g/mL."

It is used specifically in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) caused by exon 20 insertion mutations in the EGFR gene, which are typically associated with a poorer prognosis (as compared to ""classical"" EGFR mutants causing NSCLC) and are associated with resistance to standard targeted EGFR inhibitors. Mobocertinib appears to be an effective means of treating this otherwise treatment-resistant NSCLC, exerting an inhibitory effect on EGFR exon 20 insertion mutant variants at concentrations 1.5- to 10-fold lower than those required to inhibit wild-type EGFR. It is available as an oral capsule taken with or without food once daily. The use of concomitant QTc-prolonging medications should be avoided, as should concomitant inhibitors of CYP3A, as these may increase the concentration of mobocertinib and thus the risk of QTc-prolongation.The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane receptor that regulates signaling pathways in the control of cellular proliferation."

2386,DB16628,"By improving the three-year survival rate from 55% to 84%, and considering the lack of alternative therapies available, fosdenopterin appears poised to become a standard of therapy in the management of this debilitating disorder. In September 2022, the EMA approved the use of fosdenopterin.Fosdenopterin replaces an intermediate substrate in the synthesis of molybdenum cofactor, a compound necessary for the activation of several molybdenum-dependent enzymes including sulfite oxidase (SOX). Given that SOX is responsible for detoxifying sulfur-containing acids and sulfites such as S-sulfocysteine (SSC), urinary levels of SSC can be used as a surrogate marker of efficacy for fosdenopterin. In MoCD type A, the disorder results from a mutation in the _MOCS1_ gene leading to deficient production of MOCS1A/B, a protein that is responsible for the first step in the synthesis of molybdenum cofactor: the conversion of guanosine triphosphate into cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP). Fosdenopterin is an exogenous form of cPMP, replacing endogenous production and allowing for the synthesis of molybdenum cofactor to proceed."

It is an inhibitor of rho-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinases (ROCK), with significantly more selectivity for ROCK2 as compared to ROCK1 (IC50 100 nM vs. 3 Î¼M, respectively). In the treatment of GVHD, a condition in which donor T-cells begin to attack recipient tissues following allogeneic hematopoeitic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), belumosudil helps to resolve immune dysregulation by shifting the balance between Th17 cells and T-regulatory cells, thereby dampening the inflammatory cascade that can occasionally be fatal. Given its mechanism of action and findings in animal trials, belumosudil is considered to carry embryo-fetal toxicity and may cause significant harm to a developing fetus should a pregnant mother be exposed. Female patients of reproductive potential, or male patients with female partners of reproductive potential, should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment with belumosudil and for one week after the last dose.Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a life-threatening complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in which the transplanted donor T-cells recognize the recipient's tissues as foreign and mount an immune response."
2397,DB16704,"durlobactam is indicated in adults for the treatment of hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP), caused by susceptible isolates of _Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus_ complex.Durlobactam is a diazabicyclooctane non-beta-lactam, beta-lactamase inhibitor. It is typically given  to protect it from degradation by certain serine-beta-lactamases. durlobactam was first approved by the FDA in May 2023. It is used to treat hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP), caused by susceptible isolates of _Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus_ complex.Durlobactam has an extended spectrum of activity compared to other Î²-lactamase inhibitors with a displayed potent inhibition against class A, C, and D serine Î²-lactamases. Durlobactam is carbamoylated by Î²-lactamase by the serine nucleophile in the enzyme active site: The covalent bond between durlobactam and Î²-lactamase is reversible due to recyclization by the sulfated amine group on durlobactam, demonstrating that durlobactam can be exchanged from one enzyme molecule to another, also known as acylation exchange."
2398,DB16709,"Stratagraft is an allogeneic cellularized scaffold product indicated for the treatment of adults with thermal burns containing intact dermal elements for which surgical intervention is clinically indicated (deep partial-thickness burns).Stratagraft (allogeneic cultured keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts in murine collagen-dsat) is an allogeneic cellularized scaffold product used for the treatment of adults with thermal burns containing intact dermal elements for which surgical intervention is clinically indicated (also known as deep partial-thickness burns). It was developed as an alternative to autografting - the process by which a patient's own skin is harvested and grafted onto the burn site - which has the disadvantage of creating a new wound at the site from which the graft is taken. Sheets containing this scaffold product are applied to the burn site and, as they contain metabolically active and viable cells, provide a variety of human growth factors and cytokines as well as extracellular matrix proteins, all of which are known to be involved in wound repair. Stratagraft consists of a murine collagen matrix with human keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts embedded within. The Stratagraft cells are slowly replaced by the patient's own cells over time, which aids in wound closure and can help to eliminate or reduce the need for autologous skin grafting (i.e. autografting)."
2399,DB16732,"Tisotumab vedotin is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer with disease progression on or after chemotherapy.Tisotumab vedotin is a tissue factor-directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) comprised of an anti-tissue factor (TF) human IgG1-kappa antibody conjugated to monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), a microtubule-disrupting agent, via a protease-cleavable valine-citrulline linker. Tisotumab vedotin is the first TF-directed ADC  that works by binding to TFs expressed on solid tumours. TF is a novel target for cancers, as it is often overexpressed on solid tumours, including cervical cancer, and it is associated with poor clinical outcomes. It is also being investigated for the combination use with other chemotherapeutic agents for recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer.Tisotumab vedotin is an anticancer antibody-drug conjugate that is made up of an antibody and monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), a cytotoxic component of the drug. Apart from directly killing tumour cells, tisotumab vedotin may exert a bystander effect by killing neighbouring cells  and promote immunogenic cell death pathways, including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis.Tisotumab vedotin is a tissue factor (TF)-directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) anti-TF IgG1-kappa antibody conjugated to the microtubule-disrupting agent MMAE via a protease-cleavable vc (valine-citrulline) linker."
2400,DB16738,"Ciltacabtagene autoleucel is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma after â¥4 prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody.Multiple myeloma is a malignancy involving the plasma cells of the bone marrow. There are a number of potentially serious adverse reactions related to ciltacabtagene autoleucel therapy which require close monitoring and intervention. Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), which may be fatal, may be mitigated with the use of  and/or corticosteroids. Serious hematologic adverse effects - including hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), and various recurrent/prolonged cytopenias - have also been observed in patients following treatment with ciltacabtagene autoleucel.Ciltacabtagene autoleucel is a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy in which genetically modified autologous T-cells are reprogrammed to target B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), a biomarker of multiple myeloma. When the product is infused back into the patient, the anti-BCMA CAR T-cells are able to recognize and eliminate BCMA-expressing target cells, including malignant plasma cells involved in multiple myeloma."
2401,DB16746,"Elivaldogene autotemcel is indicated to slow the progression of neurologic dysfunction in boys 4-17 years of age with early, active cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CALD). Allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation has been the primary treatment option; however, it is associated with a risk of graft failure and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), calling for alternative treatment options. Gene therapy with autologous hematopoietic stem cells was introduced and investigated as a possible treatment for patients with adrenoleukodystrophy. In September 2022, Skysona was approved by the FDA.Elivaldogene autotemcel works to restore missing or low levels of adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDP) in patients adrenoleukodystrophy by delivering copies of genes that code for ALDP. Functional ALDPs can promote the local degradation of VLCFAs in the brain, stabilizing the course of the disease to prevent further inflammation and demyelination."
2402,DB16820,"It was subsequently approved by the FDA in 1992 for use in aesthetic procedures and has since become one of the most popular cosmetic procedures worldwide. It is a 900 kDa multimeric complex comprising a 150 kDa toxin, a 130 kDa non-toxic non-haemagglutinating protein, and various other haemagglutinins. Letibotulinumtoxina has been a market-leading cosmetic product in South Korea for a number of years and was more recently approved in the European Union. It was approved for use in Canada in June 2022 for the treatment of glabellar lines.The intramuscular injection of botulinum neurotoxin results in a dose-related muscle weakness resulting from the irreversible blockade of acetylcholine release from pre-synaptic vesicles.Letibotulinumtoxina, like other botulinum toxins, exerts its therapeutic effects via action directly on motor neurons. The toxin heavy chain mediates binding to surface receptors on nerve endings, after which the toxin is internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis."
2403,DB16826,"Repotrectinib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic ROS1-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). ROS1 mutations are one of the defined oncogenic drives of NSCLC, and the solvent-front mutation ROS1 G2032R is responsible for 50 to 60% of -resistant cases. Repotrectinib possesses a compact macrocyclic structure that both limits adverse interactions with resistance mutation hotspots and targets mutations in the solvent-front region. This approval is based on favorable results from the TRIDENT-1 study, where the objective response rate was 79% in TKI-naive patients and 38% in TKI-pretreated patients respectively.Fusion proteins that include ROS1 domains can drive tumorigenic potential through the hyperactivation of downstream signaling pathways leading to unconstrained cell proliferation. Repotrectinib exhibited anti-tumor activity in cultured cells expressing ROS1 fusions and mutations including SDC4-ROS1, SDC4-ROS1G2032R, CD74-ROS1, CD74-ROS1G2032R, CD74-ROS1D2033N, and CD74-ROS1L2026M."
2404,DB16900,"Î²-thalassemia is a condition caused by mutations in the Î²-globin gene (HBB) that leads to a significant decrease in the production of Î²-globin. This affects hemoglobin levels, and in patients with severe forms of this disease, long-term red cell transfusions are required for survival and the prevention of serious complications. Betibeglogene autotemcel was approved by the FDA in August 2022 and is the first ex-vivo lentiviral vector gene therapy available in the U.S. for the treatment of people with Î²-thalassemia.Betibeglogene autotemcel produces a modified Î²-globin protein (Î²A-T87Q-globin) that combines with Î±-globin to form functional hemoglobin A (HbAT87Q). After betibeglogene autotemcel is infused into a patient, CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells engraft in the bone marrow and differentiate to produce Î²A-T87Q-globin that will combine with Î±-globin to form functional hemoglobin A. The use of betibeglogene autotemcel has the potential to eliminate the need for red blood cell transfusions."
2405,DB17083,"Linzagolix is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids in adult women of reproductive age.Linzagolix is a non-peptide, selective antagonist of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor. It is similar to other GnRH receptor antagonists like , , and . The median serum estradiol levels across all studied patients was in the range of 20 to 60 pg/mL, and progesterone levels were maintained â¤3.1 ng/mL in 83% of women receiving the 200mg dose of linzagolix and 68% of women receiving the 100mg dose. More specifically, this inhibition of GnRH signaling results in the suppression of both luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone signaling, the latter of which is responsible for stimulating the production of estrogen in the ovaries. Linzagolix, therefore, indirectly suppresses estrogen production and signaling, making it useful in the management of estrogen-dependent conditions like uterine fibroids."
2406,DB17088,"It may be given as the third dose of the three-dose primary series with the monovalent Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to patients between 6 months and 4 years of age, and may be used in patients â¥5 years of age as a single booster dose at least two months following the completion of primary vaccination with any COVID-19 vaccine, or following receipt of the most recent booster dose of any approved monovalent COVID-19 vaccine.The Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 is a variant of concern that was first reported in November 2021. It tends to cause less severe disease but is significantly more virulent than both the original virus and earlier variants (e.g. Delta). The Omicron variant comprises several distinct lineages and sublineages (e.g. BA.4, BA.5) which, although similar, may behave differently from one another. It is administered for active immunization against COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, including infection caused by Omicron BA.4/BA.5.Famtozinameran comprises a nucleoside-modified mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles that deliver the mRNA into host cells. Once inside these cells, the mRNA is translated by host machinery to produce a modified SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein - specifically the S protein of the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 variant lineages - which is subsequently recognized by the host immune system."
2407,DB17472,"Pirtobrutinib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) after at least two lines of systemic therapy, including a BTK inhibitor.Pirtobrutinib is a small molecule and a highly selective non-covalent inhibitor of Brutonâs tyrosine kinase (BTK). Its high selectivity has been associated with lower discontinuation rates due to adverse events and a lower incidence of atrial fibrillation. Although the mechanisms of resistance to covalent BTK inhibitors have not been fully elucidated, it appears that the presence of Cys481 mutations is the most common reason for resistance to covalent BTK inhibitors. In January 2023, the use of pirtobrutinib for the treatment of relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) after at least two lines of systemic therapy was approved under the FDA's Accelerated Approval pathway.Pirtobrutinib is a non-covalent inhibitor of Brutonâs tyrosine kinase (BTK) with more than 300-fold selectivity for BTK over 98% of other kinases. Pirtobrutinib has shown efficacy against different B-cell malignancies and is effective in patients that are intolerant of irreversible BTK inhibitors or have developed a disease resistant to these covalent inhibitors."
2408,DB17538,"Atidarsagene autotemcel is indicated for the treatment of metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) characterized by biallelic mutations in the arylsulfatase A (ARSA) gene leading to a reduction of the ARSA enzymatic activity in children with:    - late infantile or early juvenile forms, without clinical manifestations of the disease, or  - early juvenile form, with early clinical manifestations of the disease, who still have the ability to walk independently and before the onset of cognitive declineAtidarsagene autotemcel, sold under the brand name Libmeldy, is a gene therapy comprising genetically modified autologous CD34+ enriched hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells transduced _ex vivo_ using a lentiviral vector encoding the human arylsulfatase A (ARSA) gene. Libmeldy was granted orphan designation by the EMA in April 2007, and was issued a marketing authorization in the EU in December 2020 for the treatment of certain manifestations of metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD).The reconstitution of ARSA activity in the hematopoietic system was observed in all MLD patients treated with atidarsagene autotemcel. ARSA activity in the CSF grew from undetectable at baseline to detectable in all patients by month 6 post-treatment, and finally to reference range levels at year 1 post-treatment.Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is an autosomal recessive hereditary disorder characterized by an inborn metabolic error in the lysosomal enzyme arylsulfatase A (ARSA). The resulting accumulation of sulfatides causes myelin sheaths in the central and peripheral nervous systems to become dysfunctional and degrade, leading to a gradual decline in neurodevelopmental and neurocognitive abilities. Following infusion and engraftment of the stem cells, the genetically modified cells produce and secrete a functional version of ARSA."
2409,DB17743,"Fecal microbiota is indicated for the prevention of recurrence of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) in individuals 18 years of age and older, following antibiotic treatment for recurrent CDI.Fecal microbiota, given either as a rectal transplant or in an oral formulation of live spores, is an FDA-approved option to prevent the recurrence of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) in patients given an antibacterial treatment for recurrent CDI. Although the incidence of CDI has declined and the number of cases requiring hospitalization has been lower over the years, the recurrence of CDI still represents a challenge. Recurrent CDI has a high risk of mortality and a high failure rate. The use of fecal microbiota transplantation is a treatment alternative for patients with recurrent CDI, also associated with lower costs and patient waiting times. In April 2023, the agency also approved VOWST, a capsule formulation of live fecal microbiota spores for oral administration.Since fecal microbiota products are manufactured from human fecal matter, their use may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents and contain food allergens."
2410,DB17762,"Arexvy is indicated for active immunization for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in individuals 60 years of age and older by the FDA and Health Canada.Arexvy (respiratory syncytial virus vaccine, adjuvanted) is an adjuvanted vaccine developed by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals. On May 3, 2023, it was approved by the FDA for immunization against lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) as the first respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine approved in the United States. Because GSK3844766A is a subunit vaccine, it requires adjuvants for maximal effectiveness.Respiratory tract infections caused by RSV can be severe in high-risk populations, such as infants and elderly patients. Immunization remains one of the key preventative measures against RSV infection. GSK-3844766A is an adjuvanted vaccine consisting of an antigen (RSVPreF3), which induces a CD4 T cell response against RSV glycoprotein F stabilized in pre-fusion conformation, and the AS01E adjuvant, which stabilizes the antigen."
2411,DB17851,"Flotufolastat F-18 is indicated for positron emission tomography (PET) of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positive lesions in men with prostate cancer with suspected metastasis who are candidates for initial definitive therapy or suspected recurrence based on elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level.Flotufolastat F-18 (18F-rhPSMA-7.3) is an 18F-labeled ligand that targets the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). In patients with recurrent prostate cancer that require localized treatment, the use of 18F-labeled ligands for positron emission tomography (PET) offers accurate diagnostic imaging. Unlike 68Ga-labeled PSMA-targeting ligands, 18F-labeled compounds targeting this protein have a longer half-life and can be produced in larger batches. Flotufolastat F-18 is a diastereoisomer of 18F-rhPSMA-7, and compared to the other diastereoisomers of this compound, flotufolastat F-18 has a faster clearance from blood pool, liver, and kidney, and a high level of accumulation in tumors. Since prostate cancer cells overexpress PSMA and flotufolastat F-18 is internalized by cells, this radioactive agent can be used for the diagnostic imaging of prostate cancer patients."
2412,DB17929,"It is also used for the treatment of cervical dystonia in adult patients.DaxibotulinumtoxinA is an acetylcholine release inhibitor and neuromuscular blocking agent. It is a botulinum toxin without accessory proteins purified from the bacterium Clostridium botulinum type A, the gram-positive anaerobic bacterium primarily present in soil. In clinical studies, daxibotulinumtoxinA was shown to reduce the appearance of frown lines and ameliorate neck spasms in cervical dystonia. Recovery of neurotransmission occurs gradually as the neuromuscular junction recovers from SNAP25 cleavage and as new nerve endings are formed. Inhibition of acetylcholine release is reversible; however, the duration of action of daxibotulinumtoxinA decreases as there is a subsequent reduction in neurotransmitter release at the neuromuscular junction."
2413,DB18701,"Ixchiq (chikungunya vaccine, live) is indicated for the prevention of disease caused by chikungunya virus in patients â¥18 years of age who are at increased risk of exposure to chikungunya virus.Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a member of the Alphavirus genus that was first identified in Tanzania in 1952. It is spread primarily by the bite of infected mosquitos of the Aedes genus. Infection with CHIKV causes chikungunya fever, an illness characterized by acute fever and severe, persistent arthralgia. In late 2013, the first cases were identified in the Caribbean, and it has since spread to most of the Americas. There are no approved treatments for active chikungunya virus infection."
2414,DB18704,"Efbemalenograstim alfa is indicated to decrease the incidence of infection, as manifested by febrile neutropenia, in adult patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive anti-cancer drugs associated with clinically significant incidence of febrile neutropenia.Efbemalenograstim alfa is a long-acting recombinant fusion protein of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) due to the addition of the Fc portion of human IgG2, allowing for once-per-cycle administration. As endogenous G-CSF mediates the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells into granulocytes and eventually neutrophils, the administration of recombinant G-CSF like efbemalenograstim alfa can stimulate the production of neutrophils and thus reducing the severity and duration of neutropenia. This approval was contingent on positive results observed in two pivotal Phase 3 Studies GC-627-04 and GC-627-05 in the US and Europe respectively.Over the tested dose range of 30 to 360 Î¼g/kg in healthy adult males, neutrophils generally increased in a dose-dependent manner; however, the effect on neutrophils plateaued at the top two doses of 240 and 360 Î¼g/kg. The ANC levels in cycles 2, 3, and 4 tended to be higher than those observed in cycle 1. In patients with breast cancer given TAC chemotherapy, in cycle 1, median ANC peaked on Day 3 (about 24 hours after efbemalenograstim alfa-vuxw administration) in cycle 1 and 3, reached nadir on Day 8, and recovered to 2.0 x 109/L on Days 9 and 10 for the 320 Î¼g/kg and 240 Î¼g/kg doses, respectively."
2415,DB18705,"It is produced using recombinant DNA technology in CHO cell lines and is marketed by Hipra Human Health S.L. for the European market. The active ingredient in Bimervax is a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) fusion heterodimer. Its administration elicits an immune response against the RBD antigen, resulting in the formation of neutralizing antibodies that prevent the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 and, ultimately, viral infection. It also induces an antigen-specific T-cell immune response, which may confer additional protection against COVID-19."
2416,DB18716,"enmetazobactam is indicated for the treatment of adults with complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) including pyelonephritis caused by designated susceptible microorganisms.Enmetazobactam is a penicillanic acid sulfone extended-spectrum beta (Î²)-lactamase (ESBL) inhibitor. Because ESBL enzymes can hydrolyze important antibiotics such as penicillins, broad-spectrum cephalosporins and monobactams, ESBL-producing bacteria poses challenges in the treatment of serious infections. The combination product of enmetazobactam and  was first approved by the FDA on February 23, 2024, for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections. Enmetazobactam is used as cefepime-sparing therapy by preventing its breakdown by ESBL.Enmetazobactam is an antibacterial agent that is active against most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) are a group of bacterial serine beta-lactamases that hydrolyze third-generation cephalosporins (3GC), leading to the development of 3GC-resistant bacteria. When used in combination with cefepime, enmetazobactam protects cefepime from degradation by ESBLs and prevents antibiotic resistance."
